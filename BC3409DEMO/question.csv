What is a general ledger account?,"Definition of General Ledger Account
A general ledger account is an account or record used to sort, store and summarize a company's transactions. These accounts are arranged in the general ledger (and in the chart of accounts) with the balance sheet accounts appearing first followed by the income statement accounts.
Examples of General Ledger Accounts
Some of the more common balance sheet accounts and how they are further arranged in the general ledger include:

asset accounts such as Cash, Accounts Receivable, Inventory, Investments, Land, and Equipment
liability accounts including Notes Payable, Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses Payable, and Customer Deposits
stockholders' equity accounts such as Common Stock, Retained Earnings, Treasury Stock, and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

Some of the general ledger income statement accounts and how they are arranged include:

operating revenue accounts such as Sales and Service Fee Revenues
operating expense accounts including Salaries Expense, Rent Expense, and Advertising Expense
nonoperating or other income accounts such as Gain on Sale of Assets, Interest Expense, and Loss on Disposal of Assets

General Ledger Control Accounts
Some general ledger accounts can become summary records and will be referred to as control accounts. In that situation all of the detail that supports the summary amounts in one of the control accounts will be available in a subsidiary ledger.
Examples of General Ledger Control Accounts
A common example of a general ledger account that can become a control account is Accounts Receivable. The summary amounts are found in the Accounts Receivable control account and the details for each customer's credit activity will be contained in the Accounts Receivable subsidiary ledger.
Other general ledger accounts that may become control accounts include Inventory, Equipment, and Accounts Payable.",what
What is the difference between accounts payable and accounts receivable?,"Definition of Accounts Payable
Accounts payable is a current liability account in which a company records the amounts it owes to suppliers or vendors for goods or services that it received on credit.
Definition of Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable is a current asset account in which a company records the amounts it has a right to collect from customers who received goods or services on credit.
Examples of Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable
Let's assume that Company A sells merchandise to Company B on credit (with payment due 30 days later). Company A will record the amount of the sale with a credit to Sales and a debit to Accounts Receivable. Company B will record the purchase (perhaps as inventory) with a credit to Accounts Payable.
When the amount of the credit sale is remitted, Company B will debit its liability Accounts Payable and will credit Cash. Company A will debit Cash and will credit its current asset Accounts Receivable.
Symmetry with Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable
Our examples show that there are two sides to every transaction (which some people refer to as symmetry).
At the time of the sale:

Company A reported a sale and a current asset, and
Company B reported a purchase and a current liability

At the time of payment:

Company A's Cash increased and its Accounts Receivable decreased
Company B's Cash decreased and its Accounts Payable decreased

Balance Sheet: Retail/Wholesale - Corporation",what
What are accruals?,"Definition of Accruals
The accounting and bookkeeping term accruals refers to adjustments that must be made before a company's financial statements are issued. Accruals involve the following types of business transactions:

expenses, losses, and liabilities that have been incurred but are not yet recorded in the accounts, and
revenues and assets that have been earned but are not yet recorded in the accounts

Example of an Accrual of an Expense
One example of an accrual of an expense and liability is a major repair that occurs in the final month of the accounting year, but is not paid until the bill is received in the first month of the following year. For the current year's financial statements to be complete (under the accrual method of accounting) the following is necessary:

the income statement for the current year must report the repair expense, and
the balance sheet as of the last day of the year must report the related liability

To record this accrual, an adjusting entry is made that debits Repairs Expense and credits Accrued Expenses Payable. 
Example of an Accrual of Revenues
One example of an accrual of revenues occurs at your electric utility company. For instance, during December the utility likely uses natural gas and/or coal plus many employees to generate the electricity used by its customers in December. However, the utility does not bill its customers for that electricity until after it reads the meters in January. As a result, the utility's financial statements will need an accrual adjustment so that:

its income statement for the month of December and for the current year will report all of the revenues earned by the utility, and
its December 31 balance sheet will report a current asset for the amount it has a right to receive from its customers (including the amount for the electricity it provided in December)

The accrual adjustment will debit the current asset account Accrued Receivables and will credit the income statement account Accrued Electricity Revenues.",what
How do I calculate the amount of sales tax that is included in total receipts?,"Sales Tax Calculation
To calculate the sales tax that is included in a company's receipts, divide the total amount received (for the items that are subject to sales tax) by ""1 + the sales tax rate"". In other words, if the sales tax rate is 6%, divide the sales taxable receipts by 1.06. If the sales tax rate is 7.25%, divide the sales taxable receipts by 1.0725.
Example of the Sales Tax Calculation
As an example, assume that all of the items in a vending machine are subject to a sales tax of 7%. In the most recent month the vending machine receipts were $481.50. Hence, $481.50 includes the amounts received for the sales of products and the sales tax on these products. The use of algebra allows us to calculate how much of the $481.50 is the true sales amount and how much is the sales tax on those products:
Let S = the true sales of products (excluding the sales tax), and let 0.07S = the sales tax on the true sales. Since the true sales + the sales tax = $481.50, we can state this as S + 0.07S = 1.07S = $481.50. We solve for S by dividing $481.50 by 1.07. The result is that the true product sales amounted to $450. The 7% of sales tax on the true sales is $31.50 ($450 X 0.07). Now let's make sure this adds up: $450 of sales of product + $31.50 of sales tax = $481.50, which was the total amount of the vending machine receipts.
Additional Example of the Sales Tax Calculation
Now let's assume that total amount of a company's receipts including a 7% sales tax is $32,100. The true sales will be S, and the sales tax will be 0.07S. Therefore, S + 0.07S = 1.07S = $32,100. The true sales, S, will be $30,000 ($32,100 divided by 1.07). The sales tax on the true sales will be 0.07 X $30,000 = $2,100. Our proof is $30,000 of sales + $2,100 of sales tax = $32,100. In general journal form the accounting entry to record this information is: debit Cash $32,100; credit Sales $30,000; credit Sales Tax Payable $2,100.",what
What is the distinction between debtor and creditor?,"Definition of Debtor
A debtor is a person or enterprise that owes money to another party. The party to whom the money is owed might be a supplier, bank, or other lender who is referred to as the creditor.
Definition of Creditor
A creditor is a person, bank, or other enterprise that has lent money or extended credit to another party. The party to whom the credit has been granted is the debtor.
Examples of a Debtor and a Creditor
Assume that a company borrows money from its bank. The company is the debtor and the bank is the creditor. If a manufacturer sells merchandise to a retailer with terms of net 30 days, the manufacturer is the creditor and retailer is the debtor.",what
What is the cost of goods sold?,"Definition of Cost of Goods Sold
The cost of goods sold is the cost of the products that a retailer, distributor, or manufacturer has sold.
The cost of goods sold is reported on the income statement and should be viewed as an expense of the accounting period. In essence, the cost of goods sold is being matched with the revenues from the goods sold, thereby achieving the matching principle of accounting.
When the cost of goods sold is subtracted from net sales, the result is the company's gross profit.
Examples of Calculating the Cost of Goods Sold
One way to calculate a retailer's cost of goods sold is to begin with the cost of the goods it had purchased during the accounting period and then adjust it for the change in inventory. For example, if 1,000 units of a company's only product were purchased but its inventory increased by 100 units, then the cost of 900 units will be the cost of goods sold. If 1,000 units of the product were purchased but the inventory decreased by 100 units then the cost of 1,100 units will be the cost of goods sold.
Using dollar amounts, let's assume that a retailer's cost of its merchandise purchases for a year was $300,000 while the cost of its inventory increased from $100,000 to $120,000. The result is that its cost of goods sold is $280,000 (purchases of $300,000 minus the $20,000 increase in inventory).
A second way to calculate the cost of goods sold is: the cost of the beginning inventory + the cost of goods purchased = cost of goods available - cost of ending inventory. Using the amounts above, we have $100,000 + $300,000 = $400,000 - $120,000 = $280,000.
If the cost of the ending inventory were $65,000, the cost of goods sold would have been $335,000 (purchases of $300,000 + the $35,000 decrease in inventory). 
Cost Flow Assumption Is Needed
When costs change during the accounting period, a cost flow will have to be assumed. Some common cost flow assumptions include FIFO, LIFO, and average.",what
What is owner's equity?,"Definition of Owner's Equity
Owner's equity is one of the three main sections of a sole proprietorship's balance sheet and one of the components of the accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity. 
Owner's equity represents the owner's investment in the business minus the owner's draws or withdrawals from the business plus the net income (or minus the net loss) since the business began.
Owner's equity is viewed as a residual claim on the business assets because liabilities have a higher claim. Owner's equity can also be viewed (along with liabilities) as a source of the business assets.
Example of Owner's Equity
If a sole proprietorship's accounting records indicate assets of $100,000 and liabilities of $70,000, the amount of owner's equity is $30,000.
Due to the cost principle (and other accounting principles) the amount of owner's equity should not be considered to be the fair market value of the business.",what
What is the difference between the cash basis and the accrual basis of accounting?,"Definition of the Cash Basis of Accounting

Revenues are reported on the income statement in the period in which the cash is received from customers.
Expenses are reported on the income statement when the cash is paid out.

Definition of the Accrual Basis of Accounting
The accrual basis of accounting provides a better picture of a company's profits during an accounting period for the following reasons:

Revenues are reported on the income statement when they are earned, which often occurs before the cash is received from the customers.
Expenses are reported on the income statement in the period when they match up with the related revenues, occur, or expire, which is often in a period different from the period when the payment is made.

The accrual basis of accounting also provides a better picture of a company's financial position at the end of the accounting year. The reason is that all assets that were earned are reported and all liabilities that were incurred will be reported on the balance sheet.
The accrual basis of accounting is required because of the matching principle.",what
What is petty cash?,"Definition of Petty Cash
Petty cash or a petty cash fund is a small amount of money available for paying small expenses without writing a check. Petty Cash is also the title of the general ledger current asset account that reports the amount of the company's petty cash. The amount of petty cash will vary by company and may be in the range of $30 to $300.
The petty cash is controlled through the use of a petty cash voucher for each payment made. The expenses will be recorded in the company's general ledger expense accounts when the petty cash on hand is replenished.
Examples of Petty Cash Payments
Some examples of small payments made from petty cash include:

Paying the mail carrier 30 cents for the postage due on a letter
Reimbursing an employee $9 for supplies purchased
Reimbursing an employee for purchasing $14 of bakery goods for an early morning meeting


Shown above is an example of a petty cash voucher.",what
What are accrued expenses and when are they recorded?,"Accrued Expenses
Accrued expenses are expenses that have occurred but are not yet recorded in the company's general ledger. This means these expenses will not appear on the financial statements unless an adjusting entry is entered prior to issuing the financial statements.
Example of an Accrued Expense
To illustrate an accrued expense, let's assume that a company borrowed $200,000 on December 1. The agreement requires that the company repay the $200,000 on February 28 along with $6,000 of interest for the three months of December through February. As of December 31, the company will not have an invoice to process and will not be paying the interest until it is due on February 28.
Recording an Accrued Expense
Without an adjusting entry to accrue the interest expense that was incurred by the company in December, the company's financial statements as of December 31 will not be reporting the $2,000 of interest (one-third of the $6,000) that the company has incurred in December. In order for the financial statements to be correct on the accrual basis of accounting, the accountant must record an adjusting entry dated as of December 31. The adjusting entry will consist of a debit of $2,000 to Interest Expense (an income statement account) and a credit of $2,000 to Interest Payable (a balance sheet account).

What is principles of accounting?,"Three meanings come to mind when you ask about principles of accounting...

Principles of accounting was often the title of the introductory course in accounting. It was also common for the textbook used in the course to be entitled Principles of Accounting.
Principles of accounting can also refer to the basic or fundamental principles of accounting: cost principle, matching principle, full disclosure principle, revenue recognition principle, going concern assumption, economic entity assumption, and so on. In this context, principles of accounting refers to the broad underlying concepts which guide accountants when preparing financial statements.
Principles of accounting can also mean generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In this context, principles of accounting includes both the underlying basic accounting principles and the official accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). These official pronouncements are the detailed rules or standards for specific topics.",what
What are prepaid expenses?,"Definition of Prepaid Expenses
Prepaid expenses are future expenses that have been paid in advance. In other words, prepaid expenses are costs that have been paid but are not yet used up or have not yet expired.
Generally, the amount of prepaid expenses that will be used up within one year are reported on a company's balance sheet as a current asset. As the amount expires, the current asset is reduced and the amount of the reduction is reported as an expense on the income statement.
Example of Prepaid Expenses
A common prepaid expense is the six-month insurance premium that is paid in advance for insurance coverage on a company's vehicles. The amount paid is often recorded in the current asset account Prepaid Insurance. If the company issues monthly financial statements, its income statement will report Insurance Expense which is one-sixth of the six-month premium. The balance in the account Prepaid Insurance will be the amount that is still prepaid as of the date of the balance sheet.",what
What is equity?,"Definitions and Examples of Equity
Equity has several definitions that pertain to accounting:



Equity can indicate an ownership interest in a business, such as stockholders' equity or owner's equity.
Equity can mean the combination of liabilities and owner's equity. For example, the basic accounting equation Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity can be restated to be Assets = Equities.
Equity can mean an owner's interest in a personal asset. For example, the owner of a $200,000 house that has a mortgage loan of $75,000 is said to have $125,000 of equity in the house.

What is the difference between financial accounting and management accounting?,"Definition of Financial Accounting
Financial accounting has its focus on the financial statements which are distributed to stockholders, lenders, financial analysts, and others outside of a corporation or other organization. Because of the many users, the financial statements must comply with the generally accepted accounting principles, known as GAAP or US GAAP.
Definition of Managerial Accounting
Managerial accounting is focused on assisting management in the operation of the company. This will include analyzing a company's costs, assisting in financial decisions, profit planning, calculating break-even points, capital budgeting, and calculating the costs of existing products in order to value the company's inventory and to determine the cost of goods sold (both to be used on the financial statements).",what
What is the cost of sales?,"Definition of Cost of Sales
Cost of sales is often a line shown on a manufacturer's or retailer's income statement instead of cost of goods sold.
The cost of sales for a manufacturer is the cost of its finished goods in its beginning inventory plus the cost of goods manufactured during the accounting period minus the cost of finished goods in ending inventory.
The cost of sales for a retailer is the cost of merchandise in its beginning inventory plus the net cost of merchandise purchased during the accounting period minus the cost of merchandise in its ending inventory.
The cost of sales does not include selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, or interest expense.",what
What is the difference between a general ledger and a general journal?,"Definition of General Ledger
The general ledger contains the accounts used to sort and store a company's transactions.
The general ledger is organized so that the accounts will appear in the following order: 

Balance sheet accounts: assets, liabilities, stockholders' equity
Income statement accounts: operating revenues, operating expenses, other revenues and gains, other expenses and losses

The balances and activity in the general ledger accounts are used to prepare a company's financial statements.
Definition of General Journal
A general journal is used to record unique journal entries that cannot be processed in a more efficient manner. For example, checks written, sales invoices issued, purchase invoices received, and others can be recorded in a computerized accounting system when the documents are processed. Manual accounting systems will likely use special journals for recording routine transactions. Therefore, the general journal will have a limited amount of entries. 
In the general journal you must enter the account(s) to be debited and the account(s) to be credited along with their amounts and a brief description. Once a transaction is recorded in the general journal, the amounts are then posted to the appropriate accounts in the general ledger.
Examples of Using the General Journal
The following are examples of entries that will be recorded in the general journal:

Depreciation
Other adjusting entries
Bad debts
Sale of an asset used in the business",what
What is the purpose of control accounts?,"Definition of Control Account
A control account is a general ledger account containing only summary amounts. The details for each control account will be found in a related (but separate) subsidiary ledger.
The control account keeps the general ledger free of details, but still has the correct balance for preparing the company's financial statements.
Example of Control Accounts
A common example of a control account is the general ledger account entitled Accounts Receivable. When it is used as a control account, it will contain only summary amounts, such as total credit sales for a day, total collections from customers for a day, total returns and allowances for a day, and the total amount owed by all customers.
Hence, if you want to find the amount that a specific customer still owes for its purchases on credit, it will not be shown in the control account. To find the amount that a specific customer owes, its recent payments, and its recent purchases on credit, you will quickly get that information from the Accounts Receivable Subsidiary Ledger.
Control accounts could also be used for accounts payable, equipment, and inventory.",what
What is the difference between product costs and period costs?,"A manufacturer's product costs are the direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead used in making its products. (Manufacturing overhead is also referred to as factory overhead, indirect manufacturing costs, and burden.) The product costs of direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead are also ""inventoriable"" costs, since these are the necessary costs of manufacturing the products.
Period costs are not a necessary part of the manufacturing process. As a result, period costs cannot be assigned to the products or to the cost of inventory. The period costs are usually associated with the selling function of the business or its general administration. The period costs are reported as expenses in the accounting period in which they 1) best match with revenues, 2) when they expire, or 3) in the current accounting period. In addition to the selling and general administrative expenses, most interest expense is a period expense.",what
What is included in cash and cash equivalents?,"Examples of Cash
In accounting, a company's cash includes the following:

currency and coins
checks received from customers but not yet deposited
checking accounts
petty cash

Definition of Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments with a maturity date that was 3 months or less at the time of purchase. In other words, there is very little risk of collecting the full amount being reported.
Examples of Cash Equivalents
Examples of cash equivalents include: 

money market accounts
U.S. Treasury Bills
commercial paper

Typically, the combined amount of cash and cash equivalents will be reported on the balance sheet as the first item in the section with the heading current assets.",what
What is the difference between an implicit cost and an explicit cost?,"Definition of Implicit Cost
An implicit cost is present but it is not initially shown or reported as a separate cost. 
Definition of Explicit Cost
An explicit cost is a cost that is present and it is clearly shown or reported as a separate cost. 
Examples of Implicit Costs and Explicit Costs
Let's assume that a company gives a promissory note for $10,000 to a seller of a unique used machine for which the fair value is unknown. The promissory note will come due in three years and it does not specify any interest. Due to the company's weak financial position it would normally have to pay a high interest rate if it were able to borrow money. In this example, the promissory note does not show an explicit interest cost. However, due to the issuer's weak financial position and the seller having to wait three years to collect the money, there has to be some interest cost. In other words, there is some interest cost, but it is implicit. (To record the interest cost, accountants will discount the $10,000 by the approximate interest rate that the maker of the note would normally have to pay.)
If another company with the same financial condition purchased this unique machine by issuing a $7,120 note with a stated interest rate of 12% per year (and the rate is a fair interest rate for the situation), the compounded interest cost of $2,880 is explicit.
Another example of an implicit cost is the opportunity cost of a sole proprietor working in her own business. For example, Jane works as a sole proprietor and her business reported a net income of $30,000 for the year. Since a sole proprietor does not receive a salary or wages, there is no explicit cost reported for Jane's work in her business. However, if Jane is foregoing a salary of $40,000 from another company, this is an implicit cost. When considering this implicit cost, Jane is losing $10,000 by working in her proprietorship.
If Jane operated her business as a corporation, Jane will be an employee of the corporation and her annual salary will be an explicit cost presented as salary expense on the corporation's income statement.",what
What is meant by reconciling an account?,"Definition of Reconciling an Account
Reconciling an account is likely to mean proving or documenting that an account balance is correct.
Examples of Reconciling an Account
When a company reconciles its bank statement, it is reconciling the balance in its general ledger account Cash (or Cash: Checking Account) with the bank's information.
Prior to issuing a company's financial statements, it is wise to reconcile every balance sheet account by collecting the information that supports the accounts' ending balances. For example, the Accounts Receivable balance could begin by comparing the balance with an aging of the accounts receivable. 
Another example is reconciling the balance in the general ledger account Utilities Payable. This might be accomplished by computing the daily cost of each utility that the company uses. The cost per day is then multiplied by the number of days since the last meter reading date shown on the utility bills that have already been recorded.",what
What is the difference between stocks and bonds?,"Definition of Stocks
Stocks, or shares of capital stock, represent an ownership interest in a corporation. Every corporation has common stock. Some corporations issue preferred stock in addition to its common stock. Shares of common stock do not have maturity dates.
Stocks pay dividends, which are a distribution of the corporation's profits to its owners. However, the dividend occurs only if the corporation's board of directors declare the dividend. The dividend payments are not an expense on the corporation's financial statements or on its U.S. income tax return.
Definition of Bonds
Bonds are a form of long-term debt in which the issuing corporation promises to pay the principal amount at a specified maturity date. 
Bonds also promise to pay a fixed interest payment to the bondholders usually every six months until the bonds mature. In the U.S. the interest paid to the bondholders by the corporation is a deductible expense on the corporation's income tax return.
Typically businesses do not issue bonds.",what
Why is depreciation on the income statement different from the depreciation on the balance sheet?,"Definition of Depreciation
Depreciation is the systematic allocation of an asset's cost to expense over the useful life of the asset.
Example of Depreciation
Let's assume that a retailer purchased displays for its store at a cost of $120,000. The displays have a useful life of 10 years and will have no salvage value. The straight-line method of depreciation will result in depreciation of $1,000 per month ($120,000 divided by 120 months). The monthly journal entry to record the depreciation will be a debit of $1,000 to the income statement account Depreciation Expense and a credit of $1,000 to the balance sheet contra asset account Accumulated Depreciation.
Depreciation on the Income Statement
The depreciation reported on the income statement is the amount of depreciation expense that is appropriate for the period of time indicated in the heading of the income statement. 
Using our example, the monthly income statements will report $1,000 of depreciation expense. The quarterly income statements will report $3,000 of depreciation expense, and the annual income statements will report $12,000 of depreciation expense. Each month $1,000 of depreciation expense is being matched to the 120 monthly income statements during which the displays are used to generate sales revenues.
Depreciation on the Balance Sheet
The depreciation reported on the balance sheet is the accumulated or the cumulative total amount of depreciation that has been reported as depreciation expense on the income statement from the time the assets were acquired until the date of the balance sheet.
Using our example, after one month of use the accumulated depreciation for the displays will be $1,000. After 24 months of use, the accumulated depreciation reported on the balance sheet will be $24,000. After 120 months, the accumulated depreciation reported on the balance sheet will be $120,000. At that point, the depreciation will stop since the displays' cost of $120,000 has been fully depreciated. If the displays continue to be used in the 11th year, there will be no depreciation expense in the 11th year and the accumulated depreciation will continue to be $120,000.",what
What does debit memo mean on a bank statement?,"Definition of Bank Debit Memo
A debit memo on a company's bank statement refers to a deduction by the bank from the company's bank account. In other words, a bank debit memo reduces the bank account balance similar to a check drawn on the bank account.
Examples of a Bank Debit Memo
Some examples of a bank debit memo include the following withdrawals from a company's checking account:

The company's monthly loan payment
The fee for printing the company's checks
The fee for handling a check that the company deposited and the check was returned because of insufficient funds
A transfer of funds to another account at the bank

The bank's use of the term debit memo is logical because the company's bank account is a liability in the bank's general ledger. (The bank accepted the company's cash which is recorded by a debit to the bank's Cash account, and the bank credits its liability account Customer Deposit Accounts. The liability is appropriate since the bank has the obligation to return the customer's money on demand). The bank's liability is reduced when the bank charges the company's account for a bank fee. Hence, the credit balance in the bank's liability account is reduced by a debit.
In the company's general ledger, the bank debit memo will reduce the company's checking account (which is an asset) and will require the company to credit its Cash account (and debit another account such as Bank Fees Expense).",what
What is the meaning of debit?,"Definition of Debit
The term debit is similar to the term used in Italy more than 500 years ago when the double entry accounting system was documented. What you need to know today is that debit means left or left side. For example, every accounting entry will have a debit entered on the left side of a general ledger account. (There will also need to be a credit amount entered on the right side of another account.) The abbreviation for debit is dr. (which is also related to the term from 500 years ago).
Since the general ledger accounts have both a debit and credit side, or left and right side, the balance in a general ledger account will be either a debit balance or a credit balance.
Within the general ledger, these accounts are expected to have debit balances: assets, expenses, and the owner's drawing account. The debit balances will be increased when additional debit amounts are entered, and will be decreased when credit amounts are entered.
Examples of Debit
To illustrate the term debit, let's assume that a company has cash of $500. Therefore, the company's general ledger asset account Cash should indicate a debit balance of $500. If the company receives an additional $200, a debit of $200 will be entered and will result in the Cash account having a debit balance of $700.
Sometimes the word charge is used in place of debit. For example, if a company spends $300 for advertising, a credit of $300 will be recorded in the Cash account, and an accountant might add ""...and charge Advertising Expense for $300."" Another accountant might say ""...and debit Advertising Expense for $300.""",what
What is a contra asset account?,"Definition of Contra Asset Account
A contra asset account is an asset account where the account balance is a credit balance. It is described as ""contra"" because having a credit balance in an asset account is contrary to the normal or expected debit balance. (A debit balance in a contra asset account will violate the cost principle.)
Examples of Contra Asset Accounts
The most common contra asset account is Accumulated Depreciation. Accumulated Depreciation is associated with property, plant and equipment (plant assets). Accumulated Depreciation will be credited when Depreciation Expense is recorded. The credit balance in Accumulated Depreciation means that the cost of the property, plant and equipment will continue to be reported. Looking at the cost of the plant assets and the credit balance in Accumulated Depreciation allows us to see how much of the plant assets' cost has been depreciated and how much has not been depreciated.
Another contra asset account is Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. This account appears next to the current asset Accounts Receivable. The account Allowance for Doubtful Account is credited when the account Bad Debts Expense is debited under the allowance method. The use of Allowance for Doubtful Accounts allows us to see in Accounts Receivable the total amount that the company has a right to collect from its credit customers. The credit balance in the account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts tells us how much of the debit balance in Accounts Receivable is unlikely to be collected.
A less common example of a contra asset account is Discount on Notes Receivable. The credit balance in this account is amortized or allocated to Interest Income or Interest Revenue over the life of a note receivable.",what
What is the cost principle?,"Definition of Cost Principle
The cost principle is one of the basic underlying guidelines in accounting. It is also known as the historical cost principle. 
The cost principle requires that assets be recorded at the cash amount (or the equivalent) at the time that an asset is acquired. Further, the amount recorded will not be increased for inflation or improvements in market value. (An exception is the change in market value of a short-term investment in the capital stock of a corporation whose shares of stock are actively traded on a major stock exchange.)
Example of Cost Principle
The cost principle means that a long-term asset purchased for the cash amount of $50,000 will be recorded at $50,000. If the same asset was purchased for a down payment of $20,000 and a formal promise to pay $30,000 within a reasonable period of time and with a reasonable interest rate, the asset will also be recorded at $50,000.
A long-term asset that will be used in a business (other than land) will be depreciated based on its cost. The cost will be reported on the balance sheet along with the amount of the asset's accumulated depreciation. Further, the accumulated depreciation cannot exceed the asset's cost. 
The cost principle prohibits a company from recording an asset that was not acquired in a transaction. Hence, a company cannot report its highly successful management team as an asset nor can it report its highly valuable trademark that it developed over many years. (As a result of the cost principle, some of a company's most valuable assets will not appear as assets on the company's balance sheet.) On the other hand, if the company acquires a competitor's trademark in a $3 million transaction, that trademark will be reported as an asset at its cost of $3 million.",what
What is the difference between a trial balance and a balance sheet?,"Definition of Trial Balance
A trial balance is an internal report that remains in the accounting department. The trial balance lists all of the accounts in the general ledger and their balances (or all of the accounts that have balances). However, the debit balance amounts are entered in one column and the credit balance amounts are entered in another column. Each column is then summed to prove that the total of the debit balances is equal to the total of the credit balances. (In a manual accounting system, the trial balance would draw attention to the errors occurring when transactions were journalized, posted, account balances computed, etc. With accounting software, these clerical errors are unlikely.)
Definition of Balance Sheet
A balance sheet is one of the five financial statements that are distributed outside of the accounting department and are often distributed outside of the company. The balance sheet summarizes and reports the balances from the asset, liability, and stockholders' equity accounts that are contained in the company's general ledger. The balance sheet is also referred to as the statement of financial position.",what
What is the purpose of the cash flow statement?,"Purpose of the Cash Flow Statement
The purpose of the cash flow statement or statement of cash flows or SCF is to identify the major cash flows occurring during the same period of time as the company's income statement and between the related balance sheets.
The major cash flows are presented in one of these classifications:

Operating activities
Investing activities
Financing activities

The net change from these three classifications also explains the major reasons for the change in the company's cash and cash equivalents between two balance sheet dates.
In addition to the cash amounts being reported as operating, investing, and financing activities, the cash flow statement is required to disclose other information, including the amount of interest paid, the amount of income taxes paid, and any significant investing and financing activities which did not require the use of cash.",what
What is a nominal account in accounting?,"Definintion of Nominal Account
In accounting, nominal accounts are the general ledger accounts that are closed at the end of each accounting year.
The closing process transfers their end-of-year balances from the nominal accounts to a permanent or real general ledger account. As a result, the nominal accounts are also referred to as temporary accounts. The closing process also means that each nominal account will start the next accounting year with a zero balance.
Examples of Nominal Accounts
The nominal accounts include:

All of a company's income statement accounts, and
The owner's drawing account

The income statement accounts record and report the company's revenues, expenses, gains, and losses. When the company is a sole proprietorship, the balances in these accounts will be closed by transferring the net amount into the owner's capital account. If the business is a corporation, the balances will be transferred to the retained earnings account.
Since the owner's drawing account is not an income statement account, its balance will be closed by transferring its debit balance directly into the owner's capital account.
Income Statement: Retail/Whsle - Corporation, Multiple-Step
Income Statement: Retail/Whsle - Sole Proprietor, Multiple-Step",what
What is deferred revenue?,"Deferred Revenue
Deferred revenue is money received by a company in advance of having earned it. In other words, deferred revenues are not yet revenues and therefore cannot yet be reported on the income statement. As a result, the unearned amount must be deferred to the company's balance sheet where it will be reported as a liability.
The title of the general ledger liability account may have the title of Unearned Revenues, Deferred Revenues, or Customer Deposits. As the deferred amount is earned, it should be moved from Unearned Revenues to an income statement revenue account (such as Sales Revenues, Service Revenues, Fees Earned, etc).
Example of Deferred Revenue
To illustrate deferred revenue, let's assume that a company designs websites and has been asked to provide a price quote for a new website. The design company states that it can complete the new website for $70,000. The terms require a payment of $30,000 at the time the contract is signed and $40,000 at the end of the project, which is estimated to take 60 days. The company agrees to begin working on the project 10 days after the $30,000 is received.
Now let's assume that on December 27, the design company receives the $30,000 and it will begin the project on January 4. Therefore, on December 27, the design company will record a debit of $30,000 to Cash and a credit of $30,000 to Deferred Revenues. On December 31, its balance sheet will report a current liability of $30,000 with the description Deferred revenues.
As of January 31 the company has completed 2/7 of the work. Therefore, it will record an adjusting entry dated January 31 that will debit Deferred Revenues for $20,000 and will credit the income statement account Design Revenues for $20,000. Thus, the January 31 balance sheet will report Deferred revenues of $10,000 (the company's remaining obligation/liability from the $30,000 it received on December 27).",what
When do you put parentheses ( ) around a number?,"Definition of Amounts in Parentheses
Parentheses around a number could have a variety of meanings. For example, parentheses could indicate any of the following:

A negative amount, such as a negative balance in your check register
A credit balance in an account that normally has a debit balance, or a debit balance in an account that normally has a credit balance
A credit entry, when a debit entry will not have parentheses
An unfavorable variance in standard costing, as opposed to a favorable variance which will not have parentheses
An unfavorable budget variance (e.g. an actual expense is more than the budgeted amount, or actual revenues are less than the budgeted amount)
An amount that is being subtracted
The meaning of a negative amount in a series of amounts, such as the bottom line of a comparative income statement that states ""Net income (loss)""",what
Is there a difference between an expense and an expenditure?,"Definition of Expense
An expense is reported on the income statement in the period in which the cost matches the related sales, has expired, was used up, or had no future value. 
Examples of Expenses
Examples of expenses include the cost of the goods that were sold during the current period, and the following which also occurred during the current period: salaries earned by the company's employees, interest expense incurred, commissions earned by sales representatives, rent and utilities for a retail store, and many others.
Definition of Expenditure
An expenditure is a payment or disbursement. The expenditure may be for the purchase of an asset, a reduction of a liability, a distribution to the owners, or it could be payment in the same accounting period as the amount becomes an expense.
Examples of Expenditures
Examples of expenditures that will not be an expense in the accounting period in which the payments are made include the purchase of land for a future expansion and the principal portion of a monthly loan payment.
Here is an example to illustrate the difference between an expense and an expenditure. A company makes an expenditure of $255,500 to purchase equipment. The expenditure occurs on a single day and the equipment is immediately placed in service. Assuming the equipment will be used for seven years, the asset's cost could be reported on the income statement as depreciation expense of $100 per day for the next 2,555 days (7 years of use).",what
What is a creditor?,"Definition of Creditor
A creditor could be a bank, supplier or person that has provided money, goods, or services to a company and expects to be paid at a later date. In other words, the company owes money to its creditors and the amounts should be reported on the company's balance sheet as either a current liability or a non-current (or long-term) liability.
Examples of Creditors
Some creditors, such as banks and other lenders, have lent money to the company and will require the company to sign a written promissory note for the amount owed. When a promissory note is required, the company borrowing the money will record and report the amount owed as Notes Payable.
If the creditor is a vendor or supplier that did not require the company to sign a promissory note, the amount owed is likely to to be reported as Accounts Payable or Accrued Liabilities.
Other creditors include the company's employees (who are owed wages and bonuses), governments (who are owed taxes), and customers (who made deposits or other prepayments).
Some creditors are referred to as secured creditors because they have a registered lien on some of the company's assets. A creditor without a lien (or other legal claim) on the company's assets is an unsecured creditor.",what
What is the statement of financial position?,"Definition of Statement of Financial Position
The statement of financial position is another name for the balance sheet. It is one of the main financial statements.
The statement of financial position reports an entity's assets, liabilities, and the difference in their totals as of the final moment of an accounting period.
The structure of the statement of financial position is similar to the basic accounting equation. For a corporation the format will be: Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders' Equity. A nonprofit organization's format will be: Assets = Liabilities + Net Assets.
The statement of financial position must reflect the basic accounting principles and guidelines such as the cost, matching, and full disclosure principle to name a few. Accordingly, the statement of financial position is more meaningful when it is prepared under the accrual method of accounting.",what
What are adjusting entries?,"Definition of Adjusting Entries
Adjusting entries are usually made on the last day of an accounting period (year, quarter, month) so that a company's financial statements comply with the accrual method of accounting. In other words, the adjusting entries are needed so that a company's:

Income statement reports the revenues that have been earned during the accounting period
Balance sheet reports the receivables that it has a right to receive as of the end of the accounting period
Income statement reports the expenses  and losses that were incurred during the accounting period
Balance sheet reports the liabilities it has incurred as of the end of the accounting period

Examples of Adjusting Entries
Here are a few examples of the need for adjusting entries:

A company shipped goods on credit, but the company's sales invoice was not processed as of the end of the accounting period
A company received some goods from a vendor but the vendor's invoice had not been processed by the company as of the end of the accounting period
A company that prepares monthly income statements paid for 6 months of insurance coverage in the first month of the insurance coverage. (This means that 5/6 of the payment is a prepaid asset and only 1/6 of the payment should be reported as an expense on each of the monthly income statements.)
A company's customer paid in advance for services to be provided over several accounting periods. Until the services are provided, the unearned amount is reported as a liability. After the services are provided, an entry is needed to reduce the liability and to report the revenues.

Note that a common characteristic of every adjusting entry will involve at least one income statement account and at least one balance sheet account.",what
"If I want a gross margin of 25%, what percent should I mark up my product?","Definition of Gross Margin
Gross margin as a percentage is the gross profit divided by the selling price. For example, if a product sells for $100 and its cost of goods sold is $75, the gross profit is $25 and the gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of the selling price) is 25% ($25/$100).
Example of Calculating the Markup on Cost to Earn a Specified Gross Margin
Since you know the cost of a product and you know the gross margin percentage to be achieved, you can determine the selling price and the markup needed.
Let's begin by assuming that a company's product has a cost of $75 and the company desires a 25% gross margin (or 25% of the selling price). Let's use ""SP"" to indicate the product's required selling price and ""MU$"" to represent the gross profit, and state the gross margin as 0.25SP. This means that:

SP = Cost + MU$
SP = $75 + MU$
Since MU$ must be 25% of SP, we can state: SP = $75 + 0.25SP
Restating the previous point, we have: SP - 0.25SP = $75
Restating the previous point, we have: 0.75SP = $75
After dividing each side of the equation by 0.75, we have: SP = $100

With a selling price of $100 and a cost of $75, the  $25 markup as a percentage of the $75 cost is 33.33% ($25/$75). The gross profit of $25 ($100 - $75) also means a gross margin of 25% ($25 gross profit divided by the selling price of $100).",what
How do I record a loan payment which includes paying both interest and principal?,"Definition of a Loan Payment
A loan payment is likely to consist of three amounts:

Total payment amount
Interest payment
Principal payment

Generally, the interest payment is related to the principal amount that is owed to the lender. Whenever a principal payment occurs, the balance of the principal amount owed will decrease. Therefore, the next interest payment will be smaller than the previous interest payment.
Example of Loan Payment
Let's assume that a company has a loan payment of $2,000 consisting of an interest payment of $500 and a principal payment of $1,500.
The company's entry to record the loan payment will be:

Debit of $500 to Interest Expense
Debit of $1,500 to Loans Payable
Credit of $2,000 to Cash

The credit balance in the company's liability account Loans Payable should agree with the principal balance in the lender's records. This can be confirmed on a loan statement from the lender or by asking the lender for the principal balance.",what
What are assets?,"Definition of Assets
In accounting and bookkeeping, a company's assets can be defined as:

Resources or things of value that are owned by a company as the result of company transactions
Prepaid expenses that have not yet been used up or have not yet expired
Costs that have a future value that can be measured

Assets are recorded at their cost and (except for some securities) are not adjusted for changes in market value. Long-term assets such as buildings and equipment are depreciated and therefore will be reported at less than their cost.
Assets are part of the accounting equation and the balance sheet, both of which are presented in this format:
Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders' (or Owner's) Equity.
Some of the company's most valuable assets may not have been acquired in a transaction and therefore are not listed as assets on the company's balance sheet. Examples include a highly-respected trade name, a valuable patent, a very effective management team and company culture.
Example of Assets
Examples of assets that are likely to be listed on a company's balance sheet include: cash, temporary investments, accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid expenses, long-term investments, land, buildings, machines, equipment, furniture, fixtures, vehicles, goodwill, and more.",what
What is GAAP?,"Definition of GAAP
GAAP is the acronym for generally accepted accounting principles. GAAP consists of the following:

Basic underlying accounting principles, assumptions, and concepts such as the cost principle, matching principle, full disclosure principle, and more.
Detailed reporting standards and other rules established and organized by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in its Accounting Standards Codification (FASB ASC)
Generally accepted industry practices

Examples of the Basic Underlying Accounting Principles
The basic underlying accounting principles are:

Economic Entity Assumption
Going Concern Assumption
Time Period Assumption
Monetary Unit Assumption
Cost Principle (or Measurement Principle)
Matching Principle (or Expense Recognition Principle)
Revenue Recognition Principle
Full Disclosure Principle
Industry Practices

In addition to the basic underlying accounting principles, there are various characteristics that also guide accountants. Some of the characteristics include objectivity, conservatism, materiality, cost/benefit, comparability, relevance, and timeliness.
Why GAAP is Important
In order for investors, bankers, financial analysts, portfolio managers, etc. to make informed decisions, it is necessary to have financial statements that are consistent and which can be compared to the financial statements of other corporations. This is more likely to occur when there are common rules for financial reporting. When financial statements are distributed by a business or other organization, the common rules that must be followed are known as generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP.",what
What is a balance sheet and why is it prepared?,"Definition of Balance Sheet
The balance sheet is prepared in order to report an organization's financial position at the end of an accounting period, such as midnight on December 31.
A corporation's balance sheet reports its:

Assets (resources that were acquired in past transactions)
Liabilities (obligations and customer deposits)
Stockholders' equity (the difference between the amount of assets and liabilities)

You can view the balance sheet as reporting the assets and the claims against those assets (liabilities and stockholders' equity). You can also view the balance sheet as reporting a corporation's assets and the amounts that were provided by creditors (the liabilities) and the amounts provided by the owners (the stockholders' equity).
A classified balance sheet reports the current assets in a section that is separate from the long-term assets. Similarly, current liabilities are reported in a section that is separate from long-term liabilities. This allows bankers, owners, and others to easily compute the amount of an organization's working capital and current ratio.
The balance sheet has some limitations. For example, the property, plant and equipment are reported at cost minus the accumulated depreciation (except land). If these assets have increased in value, the fair value is not reported because of the cost principle. Also, brand names and trademarks may have significant value, but cannot be reported on the balance sheet unless they were acquired in a business transaction.
The balance sheet should be read with the other financial statements (income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of cash flows, and the statement of changes in stockholders' equity) including the notes to the financial statements.",what
How are the balance sheet and income statement connected?,"Connection between Balance Sheet and Income Statement
The connection between the balance sheet and the income statement results from:

The use of double-entry accounting or bookkeeping, and
 The accounting equation Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity

Basically, the income statement components have the following effects on owner's equity:

Revenues and gains cause owner's (or stockholders') equity to increase
Expenses and losses cause owner's (or stockholders') equity to decrease

Example of How the Balance Sheet and Income Statement Are Connected
To illustrate the connection between the balance sheet and income statement, let's assume that a company's owner's equity was $40,000 at the beginning of the year, and it was $65,000 at the end of the year. Let's also assume that the owner did not invest or withdraw business assets during the year. Therefore, the $25,000 increase in owner's equity is likely the company's net income earned for the year. The details for the $25,000 (revenues, expenses, gains, losses) will be reported on the company's income statement for the year.
Accountants refer to the income statement accounts (revenues, expenses, gains, losses) as temporary accounts because their balances will be closed and transferred to the owner's capital account at the end of the year.",what
What is an account?,"Definitions of Account
In accounting, an account is a record in the general ledger that is used to sort and store transactions. For example, companies will have a Cash account in which to record every transaction that increases or decreases the company's cash. Another account, Sales, will collect all of the amounts from the sale of merchandise. Most accounting systems require that every transaction will affect two or more accounts. For example, a cash sale will increase the Cash account and will increase the Sales account.
The term account is also used in transactions where suppliers sell goods to customers and grant credit terms such as net 10 days. In those situations, a supplier is selling goods on account and the customer has purchased goods on account. The supplier has also increased the balance in its current asset account entitled Accounts Receivable and the customer will increase the balance in its current liability account entitled Accounts Payable.",what
What is the accounting cycle?,"Definition of Accounting Cycle
The accounting cycle is often described as a process that includes the following steps:

Identifying, collecting and analyzing documents and transactions
Recording the transactions in journals
Posting the journalized amounts to accounts in the general and subsidiary ledgers
Preparing an unadjusted trial balance and perhaps preparing a worksheet
Determining and recording adjusting entries
Preparing an adjusted trial balance
Preparing the financial statements
Recording and posting closing entries
Preparing a post-closing trial balance
Recording reversing entries

Accounting Cycle Today
The above steps were clear in a manual accounting system. However, today these steps are occurring with electronic speed and accuracy within sophisticated yet inexpensive accounting software. The accountant can enter adjusting entries into the software and can instantaneously obtain a complete set of financial statements by simply selecting them from a menu. After reviewing the financial statements, the accountant is able to make additional adjustments and almost immediately obtain the revised reports. The software will also prepare, record, and post the closing entries. It will also reverse adjusting entries that have been designated to be reversed.",what
"What are the accounting principles, assumptions, and concepts?","Definition of Accounting Principles, Assumptions, and Concepts
The basic underlying accounting principles, assumptions, and concepts include the following:

Cost principle
Full disclosure principle
Matching principle
Revenue recognition principle
Economic entity assumption
monetary unit assumption
Time period assumption
Going concern assumption
Constraints such as materiality and conservatism
Qualities such as reliability, relevance, consistency, comparability, cost/benefit

Note that the above are only the basic or fundamental underlying guidelines. The extensive generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP) are found in the authoritative source known as the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification.",what
What is the difference between gross profit and net profit?,"Definition of Gross Profit
Gross profit is defined as net sales minus the cost of goods sold.
Example of Gross Profit
Assume that a retailer had gross sales of $220,000 and sales returns and allowances of $20,000 during a recent year. Also assume that its cost of goods sold during the year amounted to $140,000. With these assumptions, the retailer's gross profit calculation is: net sales of $200,000 ($220,000 minus $20,000) minus its cost of goods sold of $140,000 = gross profit of $60,000. 
Definition of Net Profit
The term net profit might have a variety of definitions. We will assume that net profit means a company's net sales minus all expenses. The expenses include the cost of goods sold, the selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses, and the nonoperating expenses and losses. Nonoperating revenues and gains would be an increase to the net profit. If the business is a regular corporation, net profit may mean after income tax expense.
Example of Net Profit
Assume that a sole proprietorship business had the following information for it most recent year:

net sales of $200,000
cost of goods sold of $140,000
selling, general and administrative expenses of $45,000
interest expense of $5,000

The company's net profit was $10,000. The calculation is $200,000 minus $140,000 = gross profit of $60,000 minus $45,000 of SG&A expenses and $5,000 of interest expense = $10,000.",what
What are operating expenses?,"Definition of Operating Expenses
Operating expenses are the costs that have been used up (expired) as part of a company's main operating activities during the period shown in the heading of its income statement.
Examples of Operating Activities
Examples of a retailer's main operating activities involve the buying and selling of merchandise or goods. Therefore, the retailer's income statement will report the following operating expenses:

Cost of goods sold. These costs are reported as operating expenses on the income statement because of the matching principle: The cost of the merchandise that is sold is being matched with the revenues from selling the goods.
Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A). These costs are reported as operating expenses on the income statement because they pertain to operating the main business during that accounting period. These costs are expenses because they may have expired, may have been used up, or may not have a future value that can be measured.

Some authors define operating expenses as only SG&A. In other words, they do not include the cost of goods sold as an operating expense. Such a definition will be deficient when measuring a company's operating income. Clearly, the calculation of operating income cannot omit the cost of goods sold.",what
What are balance sheet accounts?,"Definition of Balance Sheet Accounts
Balance sheet accounts are one of two types of general ledger accounts. (The other accounts in the general ledger are the income statement accounts.) 
Balance sheet accounts are used to sort and store transactions involving a company's assets, liabilities, and owner's or stockholders' equity. The balances in these accounts as of the final moment of an accounting year will be reported on the company's end-of-year balance sheet.
Balance sheet accounts are also referred to as permanent or real accounts because at the end of the accounting year the balances in these accounts are not closed. Instead, the ending balances will be carried forward to become the beginning balances in the next accounting year. (This is different from the income statement accounts which are closed at the end of each accounting year and will begin the following year with zero balances.)
Examples of Balance Sheet Accounts
Examples of a corporation's balance sheet accounts include Cash, Temporary Investments, Accounts Receivable, Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, Inventory, Investments, Land, Buildings, Equipment, Furniture and Fixtures, Accumulated Depreciation, Notes Payable, Accounts Payable, Payroll Taxes Payable, Paid-in Capital, Retained Earnings, and others.",what
What is the meaning of debtor?,"Definition of Debtor
A debtor is a person, company, or other entity that owes money. In other words, the debtor has a debt or legal obligation to pay the amount owed. 
Example of Debtor
If a company borrows $10,000 from a bank, the company is the debtor and the bank is the creditor.",what
"What is the difference between revenue, income, and gain?","Definition of Revenue
Revenue is the amount earned from a company's main operating activities, such as a retailer selling merchandise or a law firm providing legal services.
Definition of Gain
In accounting, a gain is the result of a peripheral activity, such as a retailer selling one of its old delivery trucks. A gain occurs when the cash amount (or its equivalent) received is greater than the asset's carrying amount, which is also referred to as the asset's book value. For example, if the company receives $3,000 for the old delivery truck, and the truck's carry amount (book value) at the time of the sale was $600, the company will have a gain of $2,400.
Definition of Income
Non-accountants might use the term income instead of the word revenue. Generally, accountants use the term income to mean ""net of revenues and expenses."" For example, a retailer's income from operations is its net sales minus the cost of goods sold minus its selling, general and administrative expenses.",what
What is a noncurrent asset?,"Definition of Noncurrent Asset
A noncurrent asset is an asset that is not  expected to turn to cash within one year of date shown on a company's balance sheet. (This assumes that the company has an operating cycle of less than one year.)
A noncurrent asset is also known as a long-term asset.
Noncurrent assets are reported under the following balance sheet headings:

Investments (long-term)
Property, plant and equipment
Intangible assets
Other assets

Examples of Noncurrent Assets
Examples of noncurrent or long-term assets include:

Cash surrender value of life insurance
Bond sinking fund
Certain investments in other corporations
Plant assets such as land, buildings, equipment, furnishings, vehicles, leasehold improvements
Intangible assets such as goodwill, trademarks, mailing lists",what
How do you report a write-down in inventory?,"Definition of Write-down in Inventory
Under FIFO and average cost methods, when the net realizable value of inventory is less than the cost of the inventory, there needs to be a reduction in the inventory amount. Often the balance in the current asset account Inventory is reduced through a credit to a contra inventory account, which is referred to as a valuation account. The debit in the entry to write down inventory is recorded in an account such as Loss on Write-Down of Inventory, which is an income statement account.
Example of Reporting a Write-down in Inventory
Under FIFO and average cost methods, if the net realizable value is less than the inventory's cost, the balance sheet must report the lower amount. If the amount of the Loss on Write-Down of Inventory is relatively small, it can be reported on the income statement as part of the cost of goods sold. If the amount of the Loss on Write-Down of Inventory is significant, it should be reported as a separate line on the income statement.
Since the amount of the write-down of inventory reduces net income, it will also reduce the amount reported on the balance sheet for owner's equity or stockholders' equity. Thus, the balance sheet and the accounting equation will show a reduction in inventory and in owner's or stockholders' equity.",what
What is an expense?,"Definition of Expense
Under the accrual method of accounting, an expense is a cost that is reported on the income statement for the period in which:

The cost best matches the related revenues
The cost is used up or expires
There is uncertainty or difficulty in measuring the future benefit of the cost

Examples of Expense
Some of the expenses that will be reported on a retailer's income statement for the month of August include:

Cost of goods sold for the August sales. (The date that the retailer had paid for the goods is not pertinent.)
Commissions earned by the sales staff for having sold the goods in August (even if the commissions are paid in September)
Cost of the electricity used in August (even if the bill is received in September and is paid in October)
August rent for the store
Wages that employees earned in August
Advertising that took place in August

Expenses are often divided into two major classifications:

Operating expenses which involve a company's main activities. A retailer's operating expenses include the cost of goods sold and its selling, general and administrative expenses. Inside the company, these will likely be sorted by department, product line, and so on.
Nonoperating expenses which pertain to a company's incidental activities. A common nonoperating expense for a retailer is interest expense.",what
What is the difference between a cost and an expense?,"Definitions of Cost and Expense
Some people use cost interchangeably with expense. However, we use the term cost to mean the amount spent to purchase an item, a service, etc. Some costs are not expenses (cost of land), some costs will become expenses (cost of a new delivery van), and some costs become expenses immediately (airing a televison advertisement). 
Examples of Costs and Expenses
Assume that a company purchases 2,000 units of a supply item each of which has a cost of $5. If none of the units have been used, the current asset supplies will be reported at the cost of $10,000 (2,000 units at $5 each). At the time of the next balance sheet, only 500 of the units are on hand and 1,500 units have been used in the business. As a result, the balance sheet will report the supplies on hand at their cost of $2,500 (500 units at $5) and the income statement will report supplies expense of $7,500 (1,500 units at $5). 
Assume that a company purchases a delivery truck to be used in its business. Initially the truck's cost will be recorded in the asset account Delivery Truck. However, the truck's cost will become Depreciation Expense as the truck is ""used up"" in the company's revenue-generating activities.",what
"What is reported as property, plant and equipment?","Definition of Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment is the long-term asset or noncurrent asset section of the balance sheet that reports the tangible, long-lived assets that are used in the company's operations. These assets are commonly referred to as the company's fixed assets or plant assets.
Generally, the property, plant and equipment assets are reported at their cost followed by a deduction for the accumulated depreciation that applies to all of these assets except land (which is not depreciated).
Examples of Property, Plant and Equipment
Typical assets that are included in property, plant and equipment are land, buildings, machinery, equipment, vehicles, furniture, fixtures, office equipment, etc. which are used in the business. Also included in this balance sheet classification is a subtraction of the accumulated depreciation that pertains to these assets.",what
What is budgeting?,"Definition of Budgeting
Budgeting is the process of preparing detailed projections of future amounts. Companies often engage in two types of budgeting:

Operational budgeting, and
Capital budgeting

Examples of Operational Budgeting
In a business, the budgeting for operations will include preparing the following projections for the next accounting year:

Amounts for sales
Amounts for producing goods
Amounts for each department's expenses
Summarizing the above budgets into a master budget or profit plan
Cash receipts and disbursements for a cash budget
Projected financial statements also referred to as pro-forma financial statements

Once prepared and approved, the budgeted amounts are used as a guide or road map in controlling the next year's business activities.
Example of Capital Budgeting
Capital budgeting involves future projects which overlap several or many future accounting periods. Capital budgeting usually means listing each project along with its cash outlays and expected cash inflows for each year. The amounts should be discounted to their present values and also ranked by priority and profitability.
Once prepared, the capital budget provides a guide for investing in future fixed assets as well as arranging for the financing of the projects.",what
What is the difference between liability and debt?,"Definition of Liability
In accounting and bookkeeping, the term liability refers to a company's obligation arising from a past transaction.
Examples of Liabilities
A few of the more common types of liabilities include:

Accounts payable
Loans or notes payable
Accrued expenses payable
Deferred revenues
Bonds payable
Income taxes payable and deferred income taxes

Definition of Debt
When some people use the term debt, they are referring to all of the amounts that a company owes. In other words, they use the term debt to mean total liabilities.
Others use the term debt to mean only the formal, written loans and bonds payable.
Examples of Debt
As an example of debt meaning the total amount of a company's liabilities, we look to the debt-to-equity ratio. In the calculation of that financial ratio, debt  means the total amount of liabilities (not merely the amount of short-term and long-term loans and bonds payable).
Others use the word debt  to mean only the formal, written financing agreements such as short-term loans payable, long-term loans payable, and bonds payable.
This is a good reminder that people have different perspectives and understandings of accounting terms.",what
What are some reasons that cause the balance on the bank statement to differ from the cash balance on the books?,"Reasons a Bank Balance Will Differ from a Company's Balance
Some of the reasons for a difference between the balance on the bank statement and the balance on the books include:

Outstanding checks
Deposits in transit
Bank service charges and check printing charges
Errors on the company's books
Electronic charges and deposits that appear on the bank statement but are not yet recorded in the company's records

How to Document the Differences
Any items that are already recorded in the company's general ledger accounts, but have not yet appeared on the bank statement (outstanding checks, deposits in transit), will be noted as an adjustment to the balance per bank statement. Outstanding checks are a deduction to the balance per bank; deposits in transit are an addition to the balance per bank.
If an item is on the bank statement but has not yet been entered on the books, the items are noted as an adjustment to the balance per books. Bank service charges, check printing charges, and other electronic deductions that are not yet recorded in the company's accounts will become deductions from the cash balance per the books. Electronic deposits not yet recorded by the company will become additions to the cash balance per books.",what
What is gross profit?,"Definition of Gross Profit
Gross profit is defined as net sales minus the cost of goods sold.
Gross profit is sometimes referred to as gross margin. (However, gross margin can also mean the gross profit expressed as a percentage of net sales.)
Gross profit is presented on a multiple-step income statement prior to deducting selling, general and administrative expenses and prior to nonoperating revenues, nonoperating expenses, gains and losses.
Example of Gross Profit
Let's assume that a manufacturer has net sales of $60,000 and its cost of goods sold (using absorption costing) is $39,000. Therefore, the manufacturer's gross profit is $21,000 ($60,000 minus $39,000). The gross profit ratio or gross profit percentage is 35% (gross profit of $21,000 divided by net sales of $60,000).",what
What is the difference between cost and expense?,"Definition of Cost
A cost might be an expense or it might be an asset. 
Definition of Expense
An expense is a cost that has expired or was necessary in order to earn revenues. The matching principle guides accountants as to when a cost will be reported as an expense. 
Example of a Cost
A company's property insurance bill for the next six months of insurance shows a cost of $6,000. Initially the cost of $6,000 is reported as the current asset Prepaid Insurance (or Prepaid Expense) since the cost has not been used up (has not expired).
Example of an Expense
As a prepaid cost such as the $6,000 in the asset account Prepaid Insurance expires, the part that expires will be reported on the income statement as Insurance Expense. If the insurance cost is expiring at a rate of $1,000 per month, then each month the amount in the asset account Prepaid Insurance will decrease by $1,000 and Insurance Expense of $1,000 will be reported on the income statement.",what
What is the full disclosure principle?,"Definition of Full Disclosure Principle
The full disclosure principle requires a company to provide the necessary information so that people who are accustomed to reading financial information are able to make informed decisions regarding the company.
Examples of Full Disclosure Principle
The disclosures required under this principle can be found in a number of places, such as:

The company's financial statements including the notes to the financial statements and supplementary schedules
A publicly-traded corporation's annual report to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (Form 10-K), especially the section entitled Management's Discussion and Analysis
Quarterly earnings reports, press releases and other communications

The notes to a company's financial statements will likely begin with a description of the company's significant accounting policies such as how and when revenues are recognized, how property is depreciated, how inventory and income taxes are accounted for, and more.
Other disclosures in the notes to the financial statements include the effects of new accounting pronouncements, details regarding earnings per share, receivables, advertising, leases, related-party transactions, income taxes, stock options, contingent liabilities, and much more.",what
What is a temporary account?,"Definition of Temporary Account
A temporary account is a general ledger account that begins each accounting year with a zero balance. Then at the end of the year its account balance is removed by transferring the amount to another account. This is done through closing entries. Temporary accounts are also referred to as nominal accounts.
All of the income statement accounts are classified as temporary accounts. A few other accounts such as the owner's drawing account and the income summary account are also temporary accounts. 
Examples of Temporary Accounts
Temporary accounts include all of the various groups of income statement accounts:

Revenues
Expenses
Gains
Losses

Having temporary income statement accounts makes for easy reporting of each year's details. After the amounts for the year have been reported on the income statement, the balances in the temporary accounts will end up in a permanent account such as a corporation's retained earnings account or in a sole proprietor's capital account. (In a manual system, the balances in the income statement accounts will first be closed to an income summary account. Next, the income summary balance will be transferred to the corporation's retained earnings or to the sole proprietor's capital account.)
A temporary account that is not an income statement account is the proprietor's drawing account. The balance in the drawing account is transferred directly to the owner's capital account and will not be reported on the income statement or in an income summary account.",what
Where are accruals reflected on the balance sheet?,"Definition of Accruals
The accrual of expenses and liabilities refers to expenses and/or liabilities that a company has incurred, but the company has not yet paid or recorded the transaction. The accrual of an expense will usually involve an accrual adjusting entry that increases a company's expenses and increases its current liabilities.
The accrual of revenues and assets refers to revenues and/or assets that a company has earned, but the company has not yet received the money nor has it recorded the transaction. The accrual of revenues will usually involve an accrual adjusting entry that increases a company's revenues and increases its current assets.
Example of an Accrual as a Current Liability
Assume that a company has an emergency sewer repair on December 30. The plumbing contractor said the bill will be finalized and mailed to the company on January 10; however, the bill will be approximately $6,000. The company will need to accrue the expense incurred and the related current liability before the December 31 financial statements are prepared. The adjusting entry will debit Repairs Expense for $6,000, and credit Accrued Expenses Payable for $6,000.
Examples of other expenses that usually need an accrual adjusting entry resulting in a current liability include wages, utilities, bonuses, taxes, and interest.
Example of an Accrual as a Current Asset
Assume that during December a company has earned interest of $5,000 on its investment in U.S. Treasury bills. However, the interest will be received by the company on February 15. The company needs to accrue the revenue it earned and the related current asset before the December 31 financial statements are prepared. The adjusting entry will debit Interest Receivable for $5,000, and credit Investment Income for $5,000.

What is the difference between gross profit margin and gross margin?,"Definition of Gross Profit
Gross profit is an amount that is computed as follows:

A company's net Sales minus its cost of goods sold
A product's selling price minus the product's cost

Gross profit is the amount before deducting the following expenses: selling, general, administrative, interest, and income tax.
Definition of Gross Profit Margin
Gross profit margin is also referred to as the gross profit percentage or gross margin ratio. In that situation the calculation is:

A company's gross profit divided by the company's net sales
A product's gross profit margin divided by the product's selling price

Definition of Gross Margin
Some use the term gross margin to mean exactly the same as gross profit. Perhaps they want to avoid the word profit  since the selling, general, administrative, and interest expense have not yet been considered.
Others will use the term gross margin to mean the gross profit margin or gross profit percentage or gross margin ratio.
Example of Gross Profit, Gross Profit Margin and Gross Margin
Assume that in its most recent year a company had net sales of $80,000 and cost of goods sold of $60,000. As a result, the company had a gross profit of $20,000 ($80,000 minus $60,000) and a gross profit margin of 25% ($20,000 divided by $80,000). Some people will say the company had a gross margin of $20,000 while others will say the company had a gross margin of 25%. Others might say the company had a gross margin ratio of 25%.",what
What are income statement accounts?,"Definition of Income Statement Accounts
Income statement accounts are one of two types of general ledger accounts. (The other accounts in the general ledger are the balance sheet accounts.)
Income statement accounts are used to sort and store transactions involving:

Operating revenues
Operating expenses
Non-operating revenues and gains
Non-operating expenses and losses

Large companies may have thousands of income statement accounts in order to budget and report revenues and expenses by divisions, product lines, departments, and so on. 
Income statement accounts are also referred to as temporary accounts or nominal accounts because at the end of each accounting year their balances will be closed. This means that the balances in the income statement accounts will be combined and the net amount transferred to a balance sheet equity account. In the case of a corporation, the equity account is Retained Earnings. In the case of a sole proprietorship, the equity account is the owner's capital account. As a result, the income statement accounts will begin the next accounting year with zero balances.
Examples of Income Statement Accounts
A few of the many income statement accounts used in a business include Sales, Sales Returns and Allowances, Service Revenues, Cost of Goods Sold, Salaries Expense, Wages Expense, Fringe Benefits Expense, Rent Expense, Utilities Expense, Advertising Expense, Automobile Expense, Depreciation Expense, Interest Expense, Gain on Disposal of Truck, and many more.",what
What is going concern?,"Definition of Going Concern
The going concern assumption is a basic underlying assumption of accounting. For a company to be a going concern, it must be able to continue operating long enough to carry out its commitments, obligations, objectives, and so on. In other words, the company will not have to liquidate or be forced out of business. If there is uncertainty as to a company's ability to meet the going concern assumption, the facts and conditions must be disclosed in its financial statements.
Additional Comments
The going concern assumption provides logic for the cost principle. If a company is a going concern (and therefore liquidation is not relevant), reporting its long term assets at cost is sufficient and there is no need to report the long term assets at their current values or liquidation values? (An exception to cost exists when a long term asset's value has been impaired.)",what
What is interest expense?,"Definition of Interest Expense
Interest expense is the cost of borrowing money during a specified period of time. Interest expense is occurring daily, but the interest is likely to be paid monthly, quarterly, semiannually, or annually.
Example of Interest Expense
Let's assume that a company uses the accrual basis of accounting. If the company borrows $100,000 on December 15 and agrees to pay interest on the 15th day of each month at the rate of 1% per month, the interest expense for the month of December will be approximately $500 ($100,000 x 1% x 1/2 month). The interest expense for the month of January will be $1,000 ($100,000 x 1%).
In this example, as of December 31 no interest has been paid on the loan that began on December 15. However, the company did incur one-half month of interest expense. Therefore, the company needs to record an accrual adjusting entry that debits Interest Expense for $500, and credits Interest Payable for $500.",what
What is a capital account?,"Definition of Capital Account
In accounting and bookkeeping, a capital account is a general ledger account that is part of the balance sheet classification:

Owner's equity (in a sole proprietorship)
Stockholders' equity (in a corporation)

Examples of Capital Accounts
The sole proprietorship of J. Lee will include the following capital accounts:

J. Lee, Capital, which is increased by J. Lee's investment into the business plus each accounting period's net income, and which is decreased by the debit balance in the account J. Lee, Drawing
J. Lee, Drawing, which is a temporary account that records the proprietor's draws during the year. At the end of the year, the account's debit balance will be closed to owner's capital account

A corporation will likely have the following capital accounts:

Paid-in capital accounts such as Common Stock, Preferred Stock, Paid-in Capital in Excess of Par, which are used to record the amounts received by the corporation when shares of its capital stock were originally issued to investors.
The account Retained Earnings which consists of the amount of the corporation's earnings since the corporation was formed minus the dividends distributed to the stockholders since the corporation was formed.
The account Treasury Stock, which has a debit balance representing the amount paid by the corporation to repurchase its own shares of stock which it did not retire.

Other Information on Capital Accounts
The total of the balances in all of the capital accounts must be equal to the reported total of the company's assets minus its liabilities. Because of the historical cost principle and other accounting principles, the total amount reported in the capital accounts will not indicate a company's market value.",what
What is the operating cycle?,"Operating cycle definition
The operating cycle is the time required for a company's cash to be put into its operations and then return to the company's cash account.
Operating cycle example
A manufacturer's operating cycle is amount of time required for the manufacturer's cash to be used to:

pay for the raw materials needed in its products
pay for the labor and overhead costs needed to convert the raw materials into products
hold the finished products in inventory until they are sold
wait for the customers' cash payments to be collected

The operating cycle is the sum of the following:

the days' sales in inventory (365 days/inventory turnover ratio), plus
the average collection period (365 days/accounts receivable turnover ratio)

The operating cycle has importance in classifying current assets and current liabilities. While most manufacturers have operating cycles of several months, a few industries require very long processing times. This could result in an operating cycle that is longer than one year. To accommodate those industries, the accountants' definitions of current assets and current liabilities include the following phrase: ...within one year or within the operating cycle, whichever is longer.

What is revenue?,"Definition of Revenue
Revenue is the amount a company receives from selling goods and/or providing services to its customers and clients. A company's revenue, which is reported on the first line of its income statement, is often described as sales or service revenues. Hence, revenue is the amount earned from customers and clients before subtracting the company's expenses. 
Revenue vs Net Income
While revenue is the top line on a company's income statement, net income is often referred to as the bottom line.
The difference between the amount of revenue and the amount of net income is significant. Here are some hypothetical amounts to illustrate the point:

Revenue from sales of products $300,000
Cost of the products that were sold $200,000
Expenses (wages, rent, ads, etc.) $88,000
Net income (before tax) $12,000

Using the above amounts we see that the company's net income was only 4% of its revenue ($12,000/$300,000). 
Calculating Revenue
The best way to calculate a company's revenue during an accounting period (year, month, etc.) is to sum up the amounts earned (as opposed to the amounts of cash that were received). For example, if a new company sold $75,000 of goods in December but allows the customer to pay 30 days later, the company's December sales are $75,000 (even though no cash was received in December). Reporting revenues in the period in which they are earned is known as the accrual basis of accounting. Hence, a company's revenue could occur before the cash is received, after the cash is received, or at time that the cash is received.
(Note that for income tax reporting, smaller companies may use the cash basis of accounting.)
Examples of Revenue
Common examples of revenue include:

A retailer's sales of merchandise, sales of extended warranties, and repair revenues
The fees earned by a law firm for legal services provided to clients
The amounts earned by publishers of magazines, newspapers, and electronic information

Revenue vs Income
It is important to note that many people use the term income to mean revenue. Perhaps a business owner sees money ""coming in"" from customers and logically refers to it as ""income"". However, it is best to use the word sales or revenue when referring to the amounts earned from customers, and to use the word income for an amount that reflects the subtraction of expenses.",what
Is the cost of goods sold an expense?,"Why the Cost of Goods Sold is an Expense
We often think of expenses as salaries, advertising, rent, commissions, interest, and so on. However, the cost of goods sold is also an expense that must be matched with the related sales. Hence, a company's operating income is its operating revenues minus the cost of goods sold and its sales, general and administrative expenses.
The FASB's Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No. 6, Elements of Financial Statements, paragraph 81, states that ""...expenses themselves are in many forms and are called by various names—for example, cost of goods sold, cost of services provided, depreciation, interest, salaries and wages...."" You can read the concepts statements at www.FASB.org/st.",what
What is the difference between assets and fixed assets?,"Assets are resources owned by a company as the result of transactions. Examples of assets are cash, accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid insurance, land, buildings, equipment, trademarks and customer lists purchased from another company, and certain deferred charges.
The term fixed assets generally refers to the long-term assets, tangible assets used in a business that are classified as property, plant and equipment. Examples of fixed assets are land, buildings, manufacturing equipment, office equipment, furniture, fixtures, and vehicles. Except for land, the fixed assets are depreciated over their useful lives.",what
What is the difference between a debit and a debit balance?,"Definition of Debit
A debit is an entry on the left side of a T-account.
A debit entry is used to record assets, expenses, losses, and owner's draws in their appropriate general ledger accounts. A debit reduces the amounts in liability and owner's (stockholders') equity accounts.
Definition of Debit Balance
A debit balance is the normal balance in the general ledger accounts for assets, expenses, losses, and owner's draws.
Example of Debit and Debit Balance
Let's assume that a person starts a business as a sole proprietorship with an investment of $5,000. The entry to business accounts will include a debit to Cash for $5,000. On the next day, the business spends $1,000 to purchase office equipment. Part of this entry will include a credit to Cash for $1,000. After this transaction is recorded, the Cash account will have a debit balance of $4,000.",what
Where does the purchase of equipment show up on a profit and loss statement?,"Reporting the Purchase of Equipment
Assuming that the purchase of equipment is a long-term or noncurrent asset that will be used in a business, the purchase will not  be reported on the profit and loss statement (income statement, statement of earnings). Rather, the equipment's cost will be reported in the general ledger account Equipment, which is reported on the balance sheet under the classification Property, plant and equipment. The purchase will also be included in the company's capital expenditures that are reported on the statement of cash flows in the section entitled cash flows from investing activities.
When the equipment is placed into service, the company will begin to report depreciation expense on the profit and loss statements during the years that the equipment is used.
Example of Equipment's Cost on Income Statement
Let's assume that a company buys equipment for $100,000 and it is expected to be used for 10 years with no salvage value at the end of its useful life. Using the straight-line method of depreciation, each year's profit and loss statement will report depreciation expense of $10,000 for 10 years. Each year the account Accumulated Depreciation will be credited for the $10,000 of annual depreciation.",what
Where should I enter unpaid wages?,"Definition of Unpaid Wages
Unpaid wages are usually the amounts that hourly-paid employees have earned, but have not yet been paid to the employees. 
Entering Unpaid Wages
Under the accrual basis of accounting, unpaid wages that have been earned by employees but have not yet been recorded in the accounting records should be entered or recorded through an accrual adjusting entry which will:

Debit Wages Expense
Credit Wages Payable or credit Accrued Wages Payable

Wages Expense is an income statement account. Wages Payable or Accrued Wages Payable is a current liability account that is reported on the balance sheet.",what
What is inventory?,"Definition of Inventory
Inventory is a very significant current asset for retailers, distributors, and manufacturers. Inventory serves as a buffer between 1) a company's sales of goods, and 2) its purchases or production of goods.
Companies strive to find the proper amount of inventory so that it can meet the fluctuating demand of its customers, avoid disruptions in production, and minimize holding costs.
Since the costs of the items purchased or produced are likely to change (especially with inflation), companies must elect a cost flow assumption for valuing its inventory and its cost of goods sold. In the U.S. the common cost flow assumptions are FIFO, LIFO, and average.
A company's cost of inventory is related to the company's cost of goods sold that is reported on the company's income statement.
Examples of Inventories
Retailers and distributors are likely to have one type of inventory, namely merchandise.
Manufacturers will have three or four categories of inventories:

Raw materials
Work-in-process
Finished goods
Manufacturing and packaging supplies

Manufacturers are required to report the amounts of each inventory category on its balance sheet or in the notes to the financial statements.",what
What is the accounting equation?,"Definition of Accounting Equation
The accounting equation of a sole proprietorship is assets = liabilities + owner's equity. For a corporation, the accounting equation is assets = liabilities + stockholders' equity.
The accounting equation is similar to the format of the balance sheet.
The accounting equation will always remain in balance if the double entry system of accounting is followed accurately.
Example of the Accounting Equation
Let's assume that a person starts a new sole proprietorship business by investing $10,000. The new business will now have: $10,000 of assets = $0 of liabilities + $10,000 of owner's equity. Next, let's assume the company purchases equipment at a cost of $3,000 and signs a promise to pay the $3,000 within six months. Now the company's accounting equation will contain these amounts: $13,000 of assets = $3,000 of liabilities + $10,000 of owner's equity.
Next, let's assume the new company completes a service for another business and earns revenues of $1,500 and allows the business to pay in 10 days. This means the new company will have an account (or trade) receivable of $1,500 and will have an additional $1,500 of owner's equity. After this transaction, the accounting equation will show: $14,500 of assets = $3,000 of liabilities + $11,500 of owner's equity.",what
Which accounts get closed at the end of a fiscal year?,"The temporary accounts get closed at the end of an accounting year. Temporary accounts include all of the income statement accounts (revenues, expenses, gains, losses), the sole proprietor's drawing account, the income summary account, and any other account that is used for keeping a tally of the current year amounts. Since the temporary accounts are closed at the end of each fiscal year, they will begin the new fiscal year with zero balances.
The accounts that do not get closed (their balances are carried forward to the next accounting year) are referred to as permanent accounts. The balance sheet accounts are permanent accounts.",what
What is a revenue expenditure?,"Definition of Revenue Expenditure
A revenue expenditure is a cost that will be an expense in the accounting period when the expenditure takes place.
Revenue expenditures are often discussed in the context of fixed assets. The revenue expenditures take place after a fixed asset had been put into service and simply keeps the asset in working order. (The amount spent to acquire a fixed asset is referred to as a capital expenditure. The amount of the capital expenditure will be recorded as an asset and will then be moved to the income statement as depreciation expense over the years of the asset's useful life.)
Example of Revenue Expenditure
Let's assume that a company made a capital expenditure of $100,000 to install a high efficiency machine. The new machine requires routine maintenance of $3,000 each month. This $3,000 is a revenue expenditure since it will be reported on the monthly income statement, thereby being matched with the month's revenues. Normal repairs to the machine are also a revenue expenditure, since the expenditure does not make the machine more than it was, nor does it extend the machine's useful life. As a result, normal repairs will also be reported on the income statement as an expense in the accounting period when the repair is made.",what
What is the income statement?,"Definition of Income Statement
The income statement is also known as the statement of operations, profit and loss statement, and statement of earnings. It is one of a company's main financial statements. The purpose of the income statement is to report a summary of a company's revenues, expenses, gains, losses, and the resulting net income that occurred during a year, quarter, or other period of time.
Examples of Items Appearing in the Income Statement
The main items reported in the income statement are:

Revenues, which are the amounts earned through the sale of goods and/or the providing of services
Expenses, which include the cost of goods sold, SG&A expenses, and interest expense
Gains and losses, such as the sale of a noncurrent asset for an amount that is different from its book value
Net income, which is the result of subtracting the company's expenses and losses from the company's revenues and gains. Corporations with shares of common stock that are publicly traded often refer to net income as earnings and their income statements must include the earnings per share of common stock

How the Income Statement Amounts are Calculated
The income statement amounts are best calculated for a specific period of time by using the accrual basis of accounting. Under the accrual basis the revenues are the amounts that were earned (not the amount of cash received), and the expenses are the amounts that best match the revenues or were used up during the period (not the cash that was paid out).",what
What is the difference between depreciation expense and accumulated depreciation?,"Definition of Depreciation Expense
Depreciation expense is the amount of depreciation that is reported on the income statement. In other words, it is the amount of an asset's cost that has been allocated and reported as an expense for the period (year, month, etc.) shown in the income statement's heading.
Definition of Accumulated Depreciation
Accumulated depreciation reports the total amount of depreciation that has been reported on all of the income statements from the time that the assets were put into service until the date of the balance sheet. The account Accumulated Depreciation is a contra asset account because it will have a credit balance. The credit balance is reported in the property, plant and equipment section of the balance sheet and it reduces the cost of the assets to their carrying value or book value.
Example of Depreciation Expense and Accumulated Depreciation
To illustrate, let's assume that a retailer purchases new display racks at a cost of $84,000. This asset is estimated to have a useful life of 7 years (84 months) and no salvage value at the end of 7 years. Assuming the retailer uses the straight-line depreciation method, during each month of the display racks' lives the retailer's monthly income statement will report depreciation expense of $1,000. However, the credit balance in Accumulated Depreciation will be reported on the balance sheet at $1,000 at the end of the first month, $2,000 at the end of the second month, $3,000 at the end of the third month, etc. until the balance in Accumulated Depreciation reaches $84,000 at the end of the 84th month.",what
What are the effects of depreciation?,"Definition of Depreciation
Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the cost of a company's assets used in its business from the balance sheet to the income statement (as an expense) over their estimated useful lives.
Depreciation occurs through an accounting adjusting entry in which the account Depreciation Expense is debited and the contra asset account Accumulated Depreciation is credited.
Effects of Depreciation
The following are some of the effects for a corporation that is depreciating assets:

The net income, retained earnings, and stockholders' equity are reduced with the debit to Depreciation Expense
The carrying value of the assets being depreciated and amount of total assets are reduced by the credit to Accumulated Depreciation
The depreciation expense reported on the U.S. income tax return (based on the tax regulations) reduces a corporation's taxable income (and its related income tax payments).",what
What are accounting principles?,"Definition of Accounting Principles
Accounting principles are the common rules that must be followed when preparing financial statements that are distributed to people outside of the company (or other organization).
Examples of Accounting Principles
The basic underlying accounting principles, guidelines and assumptions include the following:

the cost principle
matching principle
full disclosure principle
revenue recognition principle
industry-specific regulatory rules
materiality, conservatism, consistency, and others

In the U.S. the accounting principles also include the many complex, detailed rules that are established and maintained by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).
The combination of the basic underlying guidelines and the complex detailed accounting rules are referred to as generally accepted accounting principles (or US GAAP or GAAP).",what
What is the difference between interest expense and interest payable?,"Definition of Interest Expense
Assuming the accrual method of accounting, interest expense is the amount of interest that was incurred on debt during a period of time. Interest Expense is also the title of the income statement account that is used to record the interest incurred. Lastly, interest expense is usually a separate line on a company's income statement that indicates the amount that occurred during the period appearing in the heading of the income statement.
Definition of Interest Payable
Interest payable is the amount of interest the company has incurred but has not yet paid as of the date of the balance sheet. Interest Payable is also the title of the current liability account that is used to record and report this amount.
Examples of Interest Expense and Interest Payable
To illustrate the difference between interest expense and interest payable, let's assume that a company borrows $200,000 on November 1 at an annual interest rate of 6%. The company is required to pay each month's interest on the 15th day of the following month. Therefore, the November interest of $1,000 ($200,000 x 6% x 1/12) is to be paid on December 15. The $1,000 of interest incurred during December is to be paid on January 15. Therefore, as of December 31, the company's current liability account Interest Payable must report $1,000 for December's interest. For the two-month period, the company will report Interest Expense of $2,000 (November's and December's interest of $1,000 each month).",what
What is historical cost?,"Definition of Historical Cost
Historical cost is a term used instead of the term cost. Cost and historical cost usually mean the original cost at the time of a transaction.
The term historical cost distinguishes an asset's cost from its replacement cost, current cost, or inflation-adjusted cost. 
Generally, the cost principle or historical cost principle requires that an asset should be reported at its cash or cash equivalent amount at the time of the transaction and should include all costs necessary to get the asset in place and ready for use.
Example of Historical Cost
Let's assume that a company purchased land in 1997 for $100,000. It continues to own the land and has not made any improvements. Today the land should be reported on the company's balance sheet at its historical cost of $100,000 even though its current cost, replacement cost, inflation-adjusted cost, appraised value, and assessed value amounts range from $150,000 to $270,000.",what
What is window dressing?,"Definition of Window Dressing
Window dressing refers to actions taken or not taken prior to issuing financial statements in order to improve the appearance of the financial statements.
Example of Window Dressing
Let's assume that a company operates throughout the year with a negative balance in its general ledger account Cash: Checking Account. (At the bank, the checking account has a positive balance due to the time it takes for the company's checks to clear.) In order to avoid its December 31 balance sheet reporting a negative cash balance, the company decides to postpone issuing checks for vendors' invoices that should have been paid. The postponement allows its general ledger Cash account to temporarily have a positive amount. On January 2, the company will issue the postponed checks and will resume its normal practice of having a negative balance in its Cash account.",what
What is a fiscal year?,"Definition of Fiscal Year
A fiscal year is an accounting year that does not end on December 31. (Accounting years of January 1 through December 31 are known as calendar years.)
A fiscal year could be a 12-month period of time or a 52/53-week period of time.
One reason a U.S. business or other organization will have its accounting year end on a date other than December 31 is to coincide with its natural business year.
When an organization's fiscal year ends outside of the CPAs' busy season, the organization may be able to negotiate a lower auditing fee.
Examples of Fiscal Years
A few examples of fiscal years include:

12 months of February 1 through January 31
12 months of October 1 through September 30
12 months of June 1 through May 31
52 weeks ending on the Saturday closest to January 31. (Since 52 weeks X 7 days = 364 days vs. 365 days per year, there will be an occasional 53-week year)

School districts typically have fiscal years of July 1 through June 30 to coincide with its natural business year. Large retailers often end their fiscal years on the Saturday closest to January 31 in order to include sales returns from its peak December sales. The retailers' interim periods will be 13-week ""quarters"" consisting of one 5-week ""month"" plus two 4-week ""months"". This allows for better comparisons between years.",what
When should costs be expensed and when should costs be capitalized?,"Definition of Costs
In the context of the question, costs are the amounts paid in exchange for materials, products, or services. The costs could be:

Reported as an expense on the current period's income statement, or
Reported as an asset and expensed later. To defer the cost to the balance sheet is to capitalize the costs.

Examples of Costs Being Expensed
Costs are reported as expenses  in the accounting period when they are used up, have expired, or have no future economic value which can be measured. For example, the June salaries for the company's marketing team should be reported as an expense in June since the future economic value cannot be measured/determined.
Another example is the amount spent to repair equipment that broke in June and was repaired in June. The cost of the repair merely restored the equipment to its same condition. Since there was no additional future economic value added, the costs of repair is reported as an expense on the June income statement.
Example of Costs Being Capitalized
Costs are capitalized (recorded as assets) when the costs have not been used up and have future economic value. Assume that a company incurs a cost of $30,000 in June to add a hydraulic lift to its delivery truck that had no lift. The remaining useful life of the truck and the lift is 5 years. The cost of $30,000 should be capitalized since it added future economic value by making an improvement to the truck. The $30,000 cost increases the company's assets, but will be reduced by depreciating the cost to expense over the next 5 years.",what
Why is there a difference in the amounts for Bad Debts Expense and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts?,"Amount Reported as Bad Debts Expense
The amount reported in the income statement account Bad Debts Expense pertains to the estimated losses from extending credit during the period shown in the heading of the income statement. The estimated amount of Bad Debts Expense could be based on:

A percentage of the company's credit sales during the period, or
The change in the total amount needed in the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts based upon the amounts customers owe on the company's accounts receivable
Amount Reported as Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
The balance reported in the balance sheet account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is the estimated amount of Accounts Receivable that will not be collected. The balance in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts could be based upon:

An aging of the detailed amounts in Accounts Receivable
The result of recording the credit part of the entries to Bad Debts Expense that were based on a percentage of credit sales

Example of Bad Debts Expense and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
To illustrate, let's assume that on December 31 a company had $100,000 in Accounts Receivable and its balance in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts was a credit balance of $3,000. As a result, the December 31 balance sheet will be reporting that $97,000 will be turning to cash. During the first 30 days of January the company does not have any other information on bad accounts receivable. However, on January 31 the company learns that an additional $1,000 of its accounts receivable may not be collected. Therefore, on January 31 the company will make an adjusting entry to debit Bad Debts Expense for $1,000 and to credit Allowance for Doubtful Accounts for $1,000. After this entry is recorded, the company's income statement for the month of January will report Bad Debts Expense of $1,000 and its January 31 balance sheet will report a credit balance in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts in the amount of $4,000.",what
What is accrued income?,"Definition of Accrued Income
Accrued income is an amount that:

A company has earned
The company has a right to receive
The collection is probable
Has not yet been recorded in the general ledger accounts

Under the accrual basis of accounting, accrued income is recorded with an accrual adjusting entry prior to issuing the financial statements.
Example of Accrued Income
One example of accrued income is the interest a company earns on a bond investment. To illustrate, let's assume that a company invested $100,000 on December 1 in a 6% $100,000 bond that pays $3,000 of interest on each June 1 and December 1. On December 31, the company will have earned one month's interest amounting to $500 ($100,000 x 6% per year x 1/12 of a year, or 1/6 of the semiannual $3,000). No interest will be received in December since it will be included in the $3,000 interest that will be received on June 1. The $500 of interest that has been earned during December, but not yet received nor previously recorded as of December 31, is accrued interest income.
The accrued interest income will be recorded with an accrual adjusting entry dated December 31 that debits Interest Receivable (a balance sheet account) for $500, and credits Interest Income (an income statement account) for $500.",what
What is a general ledger?,"Definition of General Ledger
A general ledger is a grouping of perhaps hundreds of accounts that are used to sort and store information from a company's business transactions. The general ledger is organized as follows:

balance sheet accounts (assets, liabilities, equity), and
income statement accounts (revenues, expenses, gains, losses)

Under the double entry system of accounting and bookkeeping, every business transaction will affect two (or more) general ledger accounts. In addition, each transaction's debit amount(s) must be equal to its credit amounts. As a result, the general ledger is expected to have the total amount of debits equal to the total amount of credits. Further, when the account balances are listed on a trial balance, the totals should be equal.
Examples of a General Ledger
In a manual accounting or bookkeeping system, the general ledger is a ""book"" with a separate page or ledger sheet for each account. (When a significant amount of detailed information is needed for an account such as Accounts Receivable, a subsidiary ledger is often used.)
In a computerized system, the general ledger will be an electronic file of all the needed accounts. This also facilitates the electronic preparation of the company's financial statements.",what
Is a prepaid expense recorded initially as an expense?,"Definition of Prepaid Expense
A prepaid expense refers to an amount that a company has paid and a portion or all of it will be an expense in a later accounting period.
Example of a Prepaid Expense
A company with an accounting year ending on December 31 has a prepaid expense if on December 1, it paid $6,000 for insurance coverage from December 1 through May 31.
Recording a Prepaid Expense
A prepaid expense can be recorded initially as an expense or as a current asset. Either way, adjusting entries will be needed during the six months to be certain that:

The current month's insurance expense of $1,000 ($6,000/6 months) is reported on each month's income statement.
The unexpired amount of the prepaid insurance is reported on the balance sheet as of the last day of each month. For example, on December 31 the balance sheet must report $5,000. On January 31 the balance sheet must report $4,000, and so on.",what
What is the difference between an invoice and a statement?,"Definition of an Invoice
An invoice received from a supplier shows the items purchased, the cost per unit, the total cost or extension of each item, the total of all the items listed on the invoice, the terms of the sale, etc.
Definition of a Statement
A statement from a supplier lists the amounts from past invoices that the customer has not paid. For example, the statement from a supplier might indicate that as of July 31 the customer owes the entire amounts from four invoices and a small amount from a fifth invoice.
However, it is possible that the statement amount is not the current amount owed. For instance, it is possible that on July 30 and on August 3 the customer had paid the amounts owed for two of the invoices listed on the statement. For this reason, companies are wise to have the policy to make payments only from invoices and never from statements. The purpose of this policy is to avoid paying a supplier's invoice twice.",what
What is a long-term asset?,"Definition of Long-term Asset
A long-term asset is an asset that is not expected to be converted to cash or be consumed within one year of the date shown in the heading of the balance sheet. (If a company has an operating cycle that is longer than one year, a long-term asset is not expected to turn to cash within the operating cycle.) Expressed another way, a long-term asset is an asset that does not meet the criteria of being reported as a current asset. Hence, long-term assets are also known as noncurrent assets or long-lived assets. 
Examples of Long-term Assets
Long-term assets include the following:

Long-term investments. These include some investments in stocks and bonds of other corporations, a company's bond sinking fund, the cash surrender value of life insurance policies owned by the company, real estate awaiting to be sold, etc.
Property, plant and equipment. This classification includes land, buildings, machinery, equipment, vehicles, fixtures, etc. that are used in the business. These assets are reported at cost and the contra asset accumulated depreciation is also included.
Intangible assets. These include trademarks, patents, customer lists, goodwill, etc. that were acquired in a transaction.
Deferred charges. This category is used for items that do not fit into the other long-term asset classifications.",what
What is payroll accounting?,"Definition of Payroll Accounting
Payroll accounting involves a company's recording of its employees' compensation including:

gross wages, salaries, bonuses, commissions, and so on that have been earned by its employees
withholding of payroll taxes such as federal income taxes, Social Security taxes, Medicare taxes,  state income taxes (if applicable)
withholding for the employees' portion of health insurance premiums, employees' contributions to savings plans, garnishments of salaries and wages, employees' contributions to United Way, etc.
employer's portion/expense for Social Security taxes, Medicare taxes, state and federal unemployment taxes
employer's portion/expense of fringe benefits such as health and dental insurance, paid holidays, vacations and sick days, pension and savings plan contributions, worker compensation insurance, etc.

Example of Payroll Accounting
If a company's employees are paid weekly based on hours worked, the payroll processing is likely done during the first few days following the work week. If the company's accounting periods are calendar months (and the calendar year), the company will have to accrue for the wages and benefits earned by the hourly paid employees (which are not yet paid or recorded in the general ledger accounts) as of the last day of each month.
You can see more details including journal entries at our free Explanation of Payroll Accounting.",what
Are payroll withholding taxes an expense or a liability?,"Definition of Payroll Withholding Taxes
Payroll withholding taxes are amounts withheld from employees' wages and salaries. The amounts withheld are actually the employees' money that the employer is required by law to withhold and remit to the government. In other words, the employer is acting as an agent by withholding and remitting the employees' money.
Examples of Payroll Withholding Taxes
The payroll taxes withheld from employees include federal income taxes, state income taxes, and the employees' portion of the FICA or Social Security and Medicare taxes.
Payroll Withholdings are Liabilities
The payroll taxes withheld from employees are a current liability of the employer until the amounts are remitted to the governments. (The taxes withheld from employees are not an expense of the company that withheld them.) 
The payroll taxes that are not withheld from employees are expenses of the employer and are liabilities until the amounts are remitted. Examples include the employer's portion of the FICA tax and unemployment taxes.",what
What are the typical items reported as current liabilities?,"Here are the typical items that are reported as current liabilities on a corporation's balance sheet:
1. Accounts payable. These are the amounts that are due to vendors who have supplied goods or services. The accounts payable are supported by the vendor invoices that have been approved and processed, but have not yet been paid.
2. Deferred revenues. This reports the amounts that a customer has prepaid and will be earned by the company within one year of the balance sheet date. An example is a retailer's unredeemed gift cards.
3. Accrued compensation. Included in this are payroll related items such as the amounts due to employees and the amounts to be remitted for payroll taxes.
4. Other accrued expenses or liabilities. This reports the amounts that the company owes for items not recorded in accounts payable or accrued compensation. Examples include the interest expense that the company has incurred (but has not yet paid) and repairs that took place but the vendor's invoice has not been fully processed.
5. Accrued income taxes and perhaps some deferred income taxes.
6. Short-term notes. These include the loans from banks that will become due within one year of the balance sheet date.
7. The current portion of long-term debt. The principal payments of a mortgage loan or an equipment loan that must be paid within one year of the date of the balance sheet are reported in this item.
To be reported as a current liability the item must be due within one year of the balance sheet date (unless the company's operating cycle is longer). However, there is no requirement that the current liabilities be presented in the order in which they will be paid. Hence, the current portion of long-term debt might be listed last, but the principal payment might be due within several days of the balance sheet date.",what
What is net income?,"Definition of Net Income
Net income is the positive result of a company's revenues and gains minus  its expenses and losses. A negative result is referred to as net loss. (There are a few gains and losses which are not included in the calculation of net income. However, they are part of comprehensive income).
Net income is also known as net earnings. The details of the net income calculation are reported in the business's income statement.
The net income of a regular U.S. corporation includes the income tax expense which pertains to the items reported in its income statement. The net income of a sole proprietorship, partnership, and Subchapter S corporation will not include income tax expense since the owners (not the entity) are responsible for the business's income tax.
Effect of Net Income on the Balance Sheet
A corporation's positive net income causes an increase in the retained earnings, which is part of stockholders' equity. A net loss will cause a decrease in retained earnings and stockholders' equity.
A sole proprietorship's net income will cause an increase in the owner's capital account, which is part of owner's equity. A net loss will cause a decrease in the owner's capital account and owner's equity.",what
How does an expense affect the balance sheet?,"Definition of Expense
An expense is a cost that has been used up, expired, or is directly related to the earning of revenues.
Most of a company's expenses fall into the following categories:

cost of goods sold
sales, general and administrative expenses
interest expense

How an Expense Affects the Balance Sheet
An expense will decrease a corporation's retained earnings (which is part of stockholders' equity) or will decrease a sole proprietor's capital account (which is part of owner's equity).
In addition to affecting retained earnings or the owner's capital account, an expense will also cause one or more of the following changes to the balance sheet:

A decrease in Cash, Prepaid Expenses, Supplies on Hand, Inventory
An increase in the credit balance in the contra-asset account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts or Accumulated Depreciation
An increase in the balance in the liability account Accounts Payable, or an increase in Accrued Expenses Payable (including Wages Payable, Interest Payable, etc.)",what
What is recorded in the Wages and Salaries Expense account?,"Definition of Wages and Salaries Expense
The account Wages and Salaries Expense (or separate accounts such as Wages Expense or Salaries Expense) are used to record the amounts earned by employees during the accounting period under the accrual basis of accounting.
Example of Wages and Salaries Expense
Assume that a new service business begins in December and has a staff of 6 hourly-paid employees who are paid each Friday for the hours they worked during the previous week. As of December 31, the hourly-paid employees have earned $3,000 of wages for which they will be paid on the first Friday in January. In order to comply with the matching principle, the account Wages and Salaries Expense must include the $3,000 of wages in order to match the December wages expense with the December revenues. As a result, the December's income statement will present an accurate picture of December's profits and the balance sheet will report the liability for the wages owed as of December 31.",what
How do you record the interest that is unpaid on a note payable?,"Definition of Interest Unpaid on Note Payable
Interest that has occurred, but has not been paid as of a balance sheet date, is referred to as accrued interest.
Under the accrual basis of accounting, the amount that has occurred but is unpaid should be recorded with a debit to Interest Expense and a credit to the current liability Interest Payable.
Example of Recording Unpaid Interest
Let's assume that on December 10, a company made its monthly payment on a loan and the payment included interest through December 10. On the company's financial statements dated December 31, the company will need to report the interest expense and liability for December 11 through 31. This is done with an accrual adjusting entry dated December 31. If the interest for December 11 through December 31 was $100, the adjusting entry dated December 31 will debit Interest Expense for $100, and will credit Interest Payable for $100.",what
What is the difference between net cash flow and net income?,"Under the accrual method of accounting, net income is calculated as follows: revenues earned minus the expenses incurred in order to earn those revenues. If a company earns revenues in December but allows those customers to pay in 30 days, the cash from the December revenues will likely be received in January. In this situation the December revenues will increase the December net income, but will not increase the company's December net cash flow.
Under accrual accounting, expenses are matched to the accounting period when the related revenues occur or when the costs have expired. For example, a retailer may have purchased and paid for merchandise in October. However, the merchandise remained in inventory until it was sold in December. The company's net cash flow decreases in October when the company pays for the merchandise. However, net income decreases in December when the cost of the goods sold is matched with the December sales.
There are many other examples of expenses occurring in one accounting period but the payments occur in a different accounting period. In short, the statement of cash flows is a needed financial statement because the income statement does not report cash flows.",what
Is it possible for owner's equity to be a negative amount?,"Definition of Negative Owner's Equity
Negative owner's equity means the amount of a sole proprietorship's liabilities exceeds the amount of its assets. 
Example of Negative Owner's Equity
Let's assume that an owner invests $100,000 to begin a new sole proprietorship business. At this point, the owner's equity is a positive $100,000. During the first year of operations, the business's expenses exceeded revenues by $108,000 and there were no draws or additional investments by the owner. The owner's equity at the end of the first year will be a negative $8,000.
The negative amount of owner's equity is a problem that will be obvious to anyone reading the company's balance sheet. However, the company may be able to operate if its cash inflows are greater and sooner than the cash outflows necessary for meeting its payments on its liabilities.",what
What is carriage outwards?,"Definition of Carriage Outwards
Carriage outwards refers to the transportation costs that a seller must pay when it sells merchandise with the terms FOB Destination. Carriage outwards is also referred to as freight-out, transportation-out, or delivery expense.
The cost of carriage outwards should be reported on the income statement as an operating expense in the same period as the revenue from the sale of the goods. (Carriage outwards is not part of the cost of goods sold.) 
Example of Carriage Outwards
Assume that a supplier sells $700 of merchandise with the terms FOB Destination. The supplier ships the goods via United Parcel Service at a cost of $50. The supplier's income statement will report sales of $700. In addition, it will report the operating expense carriage outwards (or delivery expense) of $50.",what
What is the difference between paid-in capital and retained earnings?,"Definition of Paid-in Capital
Paid-in capital is one of the major categories of stockholders' equity. Generally, paid-in capital reports the amount that a corporation received from its stockholders (or shareholders) in exchange for the newly issued shares of its capital stock. 
Paid-in capital is also referred to as contributed capital and as permanent capital.
Definition of Retained Earnings
Generally, retained earnings is the cumulative amount of after-tax net income earned by the corporation since its inception minus the dividends that have been distributed to its stockholders since the corporation began.",what
What is an unpresented cheque or check and does it require an adjustment to the balance sheet?,"Definition of Unpresented Cheque or Check
An unpresented cheque is a check that a company has written, but the check has not yet been paid by the bank on which it is drawn. An unpresented check is also referred to as an outstanding check or a check that has not yet cleared the bank.
In the bank reconciliation, the unpresented or outstanding check is deducted from the balance per the bank in order to arrive at the adjusted or corrected balance per bank.
Effect of Unpresented Check on Balance Sheet
When a company writes a check, the company records it with a credit to the Cash account in the company's general ledger. Whether the check has or hasn't cleared the bank account, the company's Cash account balance is proper. Hence, the company's general ledger Cash account will not require an adjustment for the unpresented or outstanding check when it is reported on the balance sheet.",what
How do you record an asset that was partially financed?,"Example of Recording an Asset that was Partially Financed
Assume that your company purchased a car for $10,000 by paying cash of $4,000 and signing a promissory note for $6,000.
The accounting entry is:

Debit the asset account Automobiles for the cost of $10,000
Credit the asset account Cash for the $4,000 that was paid
Credit the liability account Notes Payable for $6,000

The liability account Notes Payable reports the principal amount owed at the time. Interest that will occur in the future is not recorded at the time of the purchase. The reason is that the interest is not owed as of that date.
Each month, one month's interest on the note or loan should be recorded with a debit to Interest Expense and a credit to Cash or Interest Payable (if the interest was not paid). Any cash payments that exceed the amount of interest owed at the time of the payment should be debited to Notes Payable. The balance in the liability account Notes Payable should agree with the principal balance owed to the lender. The balance in the liability account Interest Payable should agree with the interest due as of that date.
You can call the lender to verify the amount of principal and interest owed at a specific date and then compare the amounts to the balances in your general ledger accounts.",what
What is a financial statement?,"Definition of Financial Statement
Generally, the term financial statement could be referring to:

General-purpose, external financial reports that are distributed by a company to people outside of the company
A more-detailed, internal financial report that remains inside of the company for use by the company's management

The external financial statements of a U.S. corporation must be prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (referred to as US GAAP).
Examples of Financial Statements
The external financial statements issued by U.S. corporations should include all of the following:

Income statement
Statement of comprehensive income
Balance sheet or statement of financial position
Statement of cash flows
Statement of stockholders' equity",what
What is an accounting period?,"Definition of Accounting Period
An accounting period is the period of time covered by a company's financial statements. Common accounting periods for external financial statements include the calendar year (January 1 through December 31) and the calendar quarter (January 1 through March 31, April 1 through June 30, July 1 through September 30, October 1 through December 31). It is common for these companies to also have monthly accounting periods. However, the financial statements for the monthly accounting periods are likely to be used only by the companies' managements.
In the U.S., some companies have annual accounting periods that end on dates other than December 31. For example, a company could have a fiscal year of July 1 through the following June 30. Its quarterly accounting periods would be July 1 through September 30, etc.
It is also common for U.S. retailers to have accounting periods that end on a Saturday. The annual accounting period for these businesses may be the 52- or 53-week fiscal years ending on the Saturday closest to February 1 or any other date. The retailers' quarterly accounting periods will be the 13-week periods, and the monthly accounting periods will be a 4- or 5-week time period. 
Examples of Accounting Periods
The following are some examples of accounting periods used by U.S. companies:

Annual calendar year of January 1 through December 31
Annual fiscal year such as July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020; April 1, 2019 through March 31, 2020; etc.
52- or 53-week fiscal year such as the 52 or 53 weeks ending on the last Saturday of January, etc.
Calendar quarters such as January 1 through March 31, April 1 through June 30, etc.

Fiscal quarters such as May 1 through July 31, August 1 through October 31, etc.
13-week fiscal quarters such as the 13 weeks ending on the last Saturday in April, etc.
Calendar months such as March 1 through March 31, November 1 through November 30, etc.
4- or 5-week fiscal months such as the 4 weeks ending the last Saturday of February, etc.",what
What are inventoriable costs?,"Inventoriable costs are 1) the costs to purchase or manufacture products which will be resold, plus 2) the costs to get those products in place and ready for sale. Inventoriable costs are also known as product costs.
To illustrate, let's assume that a retailer purchases an item for resale by paying $20 to the supplier. The item is purchased FOB shipping point, which means that the retailer must pay the freight from the supplier to its location. If that freight cost is $1, then the retailer's inventoriable cost is $21. Assuming this is the only item in the retailer's inventory, the retailer's balance sheet will report inventory at a cost of $21. When the item is sold, the retailer's inventory will decrease by $21 and the $21 will be reported on the income statement as the cost of goods sold.
In the case of a manufacturer, a product's inventoriable costs are the costs of the direct materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead incurred in manufacturing the product.",what
What does a balance sheet tell us?,"Definition of Balance Sheet
A balance sheet reports the dollar amounts of a company's assets, liabilities, and  owner's equity (or stockholders' equity) as of midnight of the date shown in the heading.
Examples of Balance Sheet Elements
Assets that are reported on the balance sheet are the company's resources such as cash, accounts receivable, inventory, investments, land, buildings, equipment, some intangible assets . Generally assets are reported at their cost or a lower amount due to the cost principle, depreciation, and conservatism. The cost principle also means that some very valuable aspects of the company are not listed as assets. For example, a company's outstanding reputation, its effective management team, and its amazing brand recognition are not reported as assets if they were not acquired in a transaction involving another party or entity.
Liabilities are a company's obligations as of the balance sheet date and will include loans payable, accounts payable, accrued expenses not yet recorded in accounts payable, warranty obligations, taxes payable, and more.
Stockholders' equity or owner's equity reports the amounts that were invested by the owners plus the company's earnings that the owners chose not to withdraw as dividends or drawings.
Additional Balance Sheet Information
The balance sheet classifications allow the reader to easily compute the amount of a company's working capital and to determine if a company is highly leveraged.
Every balance sheet that is distributed by a company should include notes (or footnote disclosures). These notes provide important additional information concerning the company's financial position including potential liabilities not included in the amounts reported on the face of the balance sheet.",what
Why are assets and expenses increased with a debit?,"Let's use two transactions to illustrate why assets and expenses are increased with a debit: 1) A company pays $25,000 for a new delivery van, and 2) A company pays $800 for the current month's rent.
In both of the transactions the company pays cash at the time of the transaction. In each of the transactions the Cash account is credited. Therefore, each transaction will require a debit to another account. (Recall that double-entry bookkeeping requires at least one debit and one credit when recording a transaction.)
In the first transaction, the debit will be to a long term asset account such as Delivery Vehicles. In this transaction the asset Delivery Vehicles was increased with a debit and the asset Cash was decreased with a credit. The accounting equation (A=L+OE) remains in balance because one asset increased by $25,000 and one asset decreased by $25,000.
In the second transaction, the debit will be to Rent Expense since the amount will be used up in the current accounting period. (If the amount was a prepayment of a future period's rent, the amount would have been debited to the asset account Prepaid Rent.) Since Rent Expense reduces net income, it  also reduces owner's or stockholders' equity, which normally have credit balances. The accounting equation will show assets decreasing by the reduction in cash and owner's or stockholders' equity decreasing because of the expense.
The asset Delivery Vehicle is an asset, but will become Depreciation Expense over the life of the vehicle. The rent is an immediate expense because there is no future accounting period benefiting from the current month's rent.",what
What does it mean to replenish the petty cash fund?,"Definition of Replenishing Petty Cash
Replenishing the petty cash fund means the petty cash custodian requests and receives cash from the company's regular checking account in an amount that will return the cash on hand to the amount shown in the general ledger account Petty Cash.
Example of Replenishing Petty Cash
Let's assume that a company has a petty cash fund of $100 and its general ledger account Petty Cash has a debit balance of $100. Mary is the petty cash custodian who is the only person handling the petty cash transactions. At all times Mary should have some combination of cash and petty cash vouchers (receipts) that are equal to $100.
Next, let's assume that there is only $20.00 in cash remaining and Mary realizes that $20 is not sufficient. She needs to obtain a company check for $80 in order to cash it and return the cash amount to $100 (the amount shown in the Petty Cash account). The petty cash vouchers provide the documentation for the $80 check request. In the process Mary discovers that the vouchers add up to only $79. Mary will debit the accounts indicated on the petty cash vouchers and then debit Cash Short and Over for $1 (the amount that is not accounted for). 
It is important to realize that the $80 check will be credited to Cash (the company's checking account). There is no entry to the Petty Cash account when merely replenishing the petty cash.",what
What is the difference between par and no par value stock?,"Some states' laws require or may have required common stock issued by corporations residing in their states to have a par value. The par value on common stock has generally been a very small amount per share. Other states might not require corporations to issue stock with a par value. So the par value on common stock is a legal consideration.
From an accounting standpoint, the par value of an issued share of common stock must be recorded in an account separate from the amount received over and above the amount of par value. For example, if a corporation issues 100 new shares of its common stock for a total of $2,000 and the stock's par value is $1 per share, the accounting entry is a debit to Cash for $2,000 and a credit to Common Stock—Par $100, and a credit to Paid-in Capital in Excess of Par for $1,900. In total the Cash account increased by $2,000 and the paid-in capital reported under stockholders' equity increased by a total of $2,000 ($100 + $1,900).
If a corporation is not required to have a par value or a stated value and the corporation issues 100 shares for $2,000, then the accounting entry will be a debit to Cash for $2,000 and a credit to Common Stock for $2,000.
In other words, when the issued stock has a par value, the proceeds from the issuance gets divided between two of the paid-in capital accounts within stockholders' equity. If the issued stock does not have a par value, the proceeds from the issuance goes into just one paid-in capital account within stockholders' equity.",what
What is the difference between revenues and receipts?,"Definition of Revenues
A company's revenues are amounts it has earned as the result of business activities such as selling merchandise or performing services. Under the accrual method of accounting, revenues are reported on the income statement in the period in which they are earned even though the dependable customers will pay the company 30 days later.
Example of Revenues
On June 10, a company sells $4,000 of goods to one of its best customers with credit terms of net 30 days. On June 10, the company has revenues of $4,000 which will be recorded with a debit of $4,000 to Accounts Receivable and a credit of $4,000 to Sales Revenues. 
Definition of Receipts
A company's receipts  refers to the cash that the company received.
Examples of Receipts
The following are some examples of receipts which are not revenues:

Borrowing $1,000 in cash from the bank
Collecting $4,000 from a sale that was recorded one month earlier
Disposing of a company vehicle and receiving cash that is equal to the vehicle's book value
Receiving $1,000 from an employee who had borrowed $1,000 from the company several weeks earlier
Receiving cash from an investor for new shares of the company's common stock

Example of Both a Revenue and a Receipt
When a company makes a $200 cash sale (or performs services for $200 of cash) the company has earned revenue of $200 and has a receipt of $200.",what
What is the difference between entries in a general journal versus a general ledger?,"Definition of General Journal
The general journal is described as the book of original entry. Today the general journal is used to record adjusting entries and transactions other than payments, receipts, or payroll. An entry in the general journal will include the date, the account with the amount that is to be debited, the account with the amount that is to be credited, and a brief description. After these relatively few transactions are recorded in the general journal, the amounts will be posted to the accounts indicated.
Definition of General Ledger
The general ledger contains the accounts used by the company to sort and store the amounts from all of the company's transactions (including all of the payments, receipts, payroll, and general journal entries). These accounts are known as general ledger accounts. The amounts and balances in the general ledger accounts are used to prepare the company's financial statements. 
Example of General Journal and General Ledger
Assume that a company depreciates its equipment at a rate of $10,000 per year.
In the general journal the company enters the following information:

December 31 (and the year)
Depreciation Expense $10,000 (in the debit column)
Accumulated Depreciation $10,000 (in the credit column)
A short explanation such as ""Depreciation for the Year""

Next, the amounts in the general journal must be posted to the specified accounts in the general ledger. In our example, the account Depreciation Expense will be debited as of December 31 for $10,000 and the account Accumulated Depreciation will be credited as of December 31 for $10,000.",what
Is advertising an asset or an expense?,"Definition of Advertising Expense
Advertising is the amount a company incurs to promote its products, brands, and image via television, radio, magazines, Internet, etc. Since the accountants cannot measure the future benefit of the advertising, the advertising costs must be reported as Advertising Expense at the time the ads are run.
A prepayment of the cost of ads that will air in the future should be recorded in a current asset account such as Prepaid Advertising. When the ad is aired, the amount must be transferred from Prepaid Advertising to Advertising Expense.
Example of Advertising as an Asset and as an Expense
Let's assume that in December a corporation paid $15 million to prepare an ad and to book a time for it to be shown during the Super Bowl Game in early February. Until February, the $15 million is the current asset Prepaid Advertising. After the ad is shown in the Super Bowl Game, the corporation must credit Prepaid Advertising and debit Advertising Expense. This is necessary because the accountants cannot measure the sales (if any) that will occur because of the Super Bowl ad.",what
What are debits and credits?,"Definition of Debits and Credits
Debits and credits are terms used in accounting and bookkeeping systems for the past five centuries. They are part of the double entry system which results in every business transaction affecting at least two accounts. At least one of the accounts will receive a debit entry and at least one other account will receive a credit entry. Further, the amounts entered as debits must be equal to the amounts entered as credits.
You should think of a debit as an entry on the left side of an account, and a credit as an entry on the right side of another account. Accountants often use T-accounts to visualize the debit and credit effects on the accounts' balances.
It may take some time to learn which general ledger accounts will be debited and credited, but here are some general rules:

Expense accounts generally have debit entries and have debit balances
Revenue accounts generally have credit entries and have credit balances
Assets generally have both debit and credit entries, but usually have debit balances
Liabilities generally have debit and credit entries, but usually have credit balances
Stockholders' equity accounts could have debit and credit entries, but profitable corporations usually have credit balances

Examples of Debits and Credits
To illustrate, let's assume that a company borrows $10,000 from its bank. The company will enter $10,000 as a debit in its Cash account and a credit of $10,000 in its Notes Payable account.
If the company pays $300 for an ad to air on the radio, the company will enter $300 as a debit in the Advertising Expense account and will enter $300 as a credit in its Cash account.",what
What are accrued revenues and when are they recorded?,"Accrued revenues are fees and interest that have been earned and sales that occurred, but they have not yet been recorded through the normal invoicing paperwork. Since these are not yet in the accountant's general ledger, they will not appear on the financial statements unless an adjusting entry is entered prior to preparing the financial statements.
Here's an example. Your company lent a supplier $100,000 on December 1. The agreement is for the $100,000 to be repaid on February 28 along with $3,000 of interest for the three months of December through February. As of December 31 your company will not have a transaction/invoice/receipt for the interest it is earning since all of the interest is due on February 28. Without an adjusting entry to accrue the revenue it earned in December, your company's financial statements as of December 31 will not be reporting the $1,000 (one-third of the $3,000 of interest) that it has earned in December. In order for the financial statements to be correct on the accrual basis of accounting, the accountant needs to record an adjusting entry dated as of December 31. The adjusting entry will consist of a debit of $1,000 to Interest Receivable (a balance sheet account) and a credit of $1,000 to Interest Income or Interest Revenue (income statement accounts).",what
What is a liability account?,"A liability account is a general ledger account in which a company records its debt, obligations, customer deposits and customer prepayments, certain deferred income taxes, etc. that are the result of a past transaction. Common liability accounts under the accrual method of accounting include Accounts Payable, Accrued Liabilities (amounts owed but not yet recorded in Accounts Payable), Notes Payable, Unearned Revenues, Deferred Income Taxes (certain temporary timing differences), etc.
The balances in liability accounts are nearly always credit balances and will be reported on the balance sheet as either current liabilities or noncurrent (or long-term) liabilities.
The company with the liability account for the debt or payables is known as the debtor. The lenders, vendors, suppliers, employees, tax agencies, etc. who are owed the money are known as the company's creditors.",what
Why are accruals needed every month?,"Reasons for Monthly Accruals
Accrual adjusting entries are needed monthly only if a company issues monthly financial statements.
Two reasons for the monthly accrual adjusting entries are:

To report the revenues and the related receivables which were earned during the month, but the transactions had not been recorded in the accounts as of the end of the month
To record the expenses, losses, and their related liabilities which were incurred during the month, but the transactions had not been recorded in the accounts as of the end of the month

Monthly accruals and deferrals and other adjusting entries must be recorded prior to issuing monthly financial statements in order to comply with the accrual basis of accounting.",what
What is the difference between fixed assets and noncurrent assets?,"Fixed Assets are Part of Noncurrent Assets
Fixed assets are one of several categories of noncurrent assets. Fixed assets are usually reported on the balance sheet as property, plant and equipment.
Noncurrent or long-term assets consist of the following:

Property, plant and equipment (fixed assets)
Long-term investments
Intangible assets
Deferred charges and other noncurrent assets",what
What is a classified balance sheet?,"A classified balance sheet is one that arranges the balance sheet accounts into a format that is useful for the readers. For example, most balance sheets use the following asset classifications:

current
long-term investments
property, plant and equipment
intangible assets
other assets

Liabilities are usually classified as:

current, or
noncurrent or long-term liabilities",what
Is there a difference between the accounts Purchases and Inventory?,"Purchases Account Under the Periodic Inventory System
The general ledger account Purchases is used to record the purchases of inventory items under the periodic inventory system. Under the periodic system the account Inventory will have no entries until it is adjusted at the end of the accounting year so that it reports the cost of the ending inventory.
Under the periodic system, the cost in the account Purchases will be added to the cost of the beginning inventory to arrive at the cost of goods available. The cost of the ending inventory is computed through a physical count (or an estimate) and is subtracted from the cost of goods available to arrive at the cost of goods sold.
Inventory Account Under the Perpetual Inventory System
The account Purchases is nonexistent with the perpetual inventory system. Under the perpetual inventory system, the cost of inventory items purchased are recorded directly into the account Inventory.
Under the perpetual system, the costs of the goods sold are removed from the account Inventory when the goods are sold and are recorded in the account Cost of Goods Sold. As a result, the balance in the account Inventory should be the cost of the ending inventory.",what
Does sales commission get reported in the income statement?,"Sales commissions earned by a company would be reported as revenue in the company's income statement. Sales commissions that a company must pay to others are reported as an expense.
Under the accrual basis of accounting (as opposed to the cash basis) commission revenues should be reported when the company earns the commissions. The commission expense should be reported when the company has incurred the expense and liability. (This would also be the time when the other party has earned the commissions and the right to receive them.)
The commission revenues would be reported as operating revenue (in the section where sales are reported), if the commissions are earned as a main activity of the company. If the commissions are incidental or involve a peripheral activity, these commission revenues would be reported as other income.
Commission expense would be reported as a selling expense along with other operating expenses when they are related to the company's main activities. If a commission expense pertains to a peripheral activity, it would be reported as other expense.",what
"If inventory is understated at the end of the year, what is the effect on net income?","If inventory is understated at the end of the year, the net income for the year is also understated.
Here's a brief explanation. If a company has a cost of goods available of $100,000 and it assigns too little of that cost to inventory, then too much of that cost will appear on the income statement as the cost of goods sold. Too much cost on the income statement will mean too little net income.
Another way to view this is through the accounting equation, Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity. If you assign too little of the cost of goods available to Assets, then the amount of Owner's Equity will be too little—caused by net income being too little.",what
What is Big 4 Accounting?,"Big 4 usually refers to the four largest accounting and auditing firms: PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, Ernst & Young, and KPMG. These certified public accounting (CPA) firms perform most of the audits which are required of U.S. corporations having stock that is publicly traded.
In the 1980s and before, the majority of the audits of publicly traded corporations were performed by the Big 8—the eight largest CPA firms. However, some of those firms merged with others and Arthur Andersen ceased to exist. As a result, the Big 8 is now the Big 4.
The reference to Big 4 exists because the size of each of the four largest firms is several times the size of the 5th largest firm. There was a similar size disparity in the 1980s between the 8th largest firm and the 9th largest firm.
In addition to performing audits and other assurance services, the Big 4 provide tax advising and various management services.",what
What is the accounting entry to close the sole proprietorship drawing account?,"Definition of Sole Proprietorship Drawing Account
The drawing or withdrawal account for a sole proprietorship is a temporary owner equity's account that is closed at the end of the accounting year. The drawing account is also a contra account to owner's equity, because the drawing account's debit balance is contrary to the normal credit balance for an owner's equity account.
At the end of the accounting year, the drawing account is closed directly to the capital account with an entry that debits the owner's capital account and credits the owner's drawing account. Please note that the owner's drawing account is not an expense and as a result it does not get closed to the Income Summary account nor will the amount appear on the company's income statement.
Example of the Entry to Close the Drawing Account
Let's assume that at the end of the accounting year the account Eve Jones, Drawing has a debit balance of $24,000. This balance is the result of Eve withdrawing $2,000 per month from her sole proprietorship for her personal use. (The monthly withdrawals were recorded with a debit to Eve Jones, Drawing and a credit to Cash.) The journal entry to close the drawing account at the end of the accounting year will credit Eve Jones, Drawing for $24,000 and will debit Eve Jones, Capital for $24,000.",what
What is the difference between income and profit?,"Some people intend for the terms income and profit to have the same meaning. For example, the income statement was commonly referred to as the profit and loss (P&L) statement. When a company is profitable, we mean that the company has a positive net income.
To aid in understanding these terms, the word ""net"" is often added. Hence, we often see the terms net income and net profit. This communicates that the amounts are the remainder after expenses have been deducted. For example, a company's profit margin is often listed as the net profit margin (which is defined as the company's net income divided by its net sales). The word ""net"" also helps to distinguish a company's net profit from its gross profit, and its net profit margin from its gross profit margin.
Some people use the term income to mean revenues. For example, a bank or an individual will often refer to the interest they earn on bond investments as interest income or investment income. A retailer will refer to the sales of merchandise as revenues, but the revenues from secondary activities will be reported as other income or nonoperating income.
It is wise to keep in mind that different meanings are not unusual among people, businesses and countries.",what
Why isn't the direct write off method of uncollectible accounts receivable the preferred method?,"Definition of Direct Write Off Method
Under the direct write off method of accounting for credit losses pertaining to accounts receivable, no bad debts expense is reported on the income statement until an account receivable is actually removed from the company's receivables.
Under the direct write off method there is no contra asset account such as  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. This means that the balance sheet is reporting the full amount of accounts receivable and therefore implying that the full amount will be converted to cash.
Reason Why the Direct Write Off Method is Not Preferred
The accounting profession does not prefer the direct method for the following reasons:

The accounts receivable are more likely to be reported on the balance sheet at an amount that is greater than the amount that will actually be collected
The bad debts expense resulting from having sold goods on credit will appear on the income statement only after the bad account is identified and removed from the company's accounts receivable. Hence, the bad debts expense is reported much later than would be the case under the allowance method.

[The Internal Revenue Service requires the direct write off method in order to prevent taxpayers from claiming a bad debts expenses based on an anticipated potential loss.]",what
What is the difference between revenues and earnings?,"A U.S. corporation's revenues  are reported on the top line of its income statement, while its earnings are reported on the bottom line (or near the bottom) of the income statement.
Revenues is the gross amount earned from selling goods or providing services during the period shown in the heading of the income statement. In other words, revenues is the amount earned before deducting the cost of goods sold, expenses, and losses.
Earnings is the net amount earned after deducting the cost of goods sold, expenses and losses. It is often presented as net earnings or net income. When a corporation's stock is publicly-traded, the earnings must also be reported on the income statement as earnings per share (EPS) of common stock.",what
Why is the P&L profit entered on the credit side of the balance sheet?,"Profit's Effect on the Balance Sheet
The profit or net income belongs to the owner of a sole proprietorship or to the stockholders of a corporation.
If a company prepares its balance sheet in the account form, it means that the assets are presented on the left side or debit side. The liabilities and owner's equity (or stockholders' equity) are presented on the right side or credit side.
Recall that the balance sheet reflects the accounting equation, Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity.
Example of Profit's Effect on the Balance Sheet
Assume that you own and operate a sole proprietorship. You provided a service to a client and earned revenues of $900 and had no expenses. One of the business assets (cash or accounts receivable) increased and the liabilities did not change. As a result, the owner's equity (the owner's capital account) increases.
Accountants do prepare an income statement or P&L to report the revenues and expenses, but the ultimate effect of a positive amount of profit or net income is to increase the business's assets and owner's equity.",what
Which accounts are debited in the closing entries?,"Definition of Closing Entries
Closing entries occur at the end of an accounting year to transfer the balances in the temporary accounts to a permanent or real account. The intended result is for each temporary account to begin the next accounting year with a zero balance.
The temporary accounts include the income statement accounts (revenue, expense, gain, loss, income summary) and also the drawing account of a sole proprietorship. The balances in these accounts will ultimately end up in the sole proprietor's capital account or the corporation's retained earnings account.
Accounts that are Debited in the Closing Entries
The following temporary accounts normally have credit balances that require a debit as part of the closing entries:

Revenue accounts
Gain accounts
Contra expense accounts

Income Statement: Retail/Whsle - Corporation, Multiple-Step
Statement of Owner's Equity: Sole Proprietor",what
"If a company earns a profit, which balance sheet items change?","Definition of Profit
Profit is the result of revenues minus expenses.
How Profits Change the Balance Sheet
Since all business transactions affect at least two accounts, there will likely be an enormous number of changes to the balance sheet. Here are some of the changes:

Owner's equity or stockholders' equity will increase by the positive amount of net income
Accounts receivable will change by the amount of sales/services provided with credit terms
Inventory will decrease when goods are sold
Cash will increase when goods are sold for cash and when accounts receivable are collected
Cash will decrease when cash is paid for expenses, inventory, equipment, liabilities, etc.
Accounts payable will increase for expenses that were not paid with cash
Accumulated depreciation will change when an asset is depreciated

Again, the list is just a few of the balance sheet changes that may occur when a company has profitable operations.",what
How can a company have a profit but not have cash?,"Definition of Profit
Under the accrual basis of accounting, profit is the amount of revenues earned minus the amount of expenses incurred. Note that revenues are not receipts, and expenses are not payments.
Examples of Profit Without Cash
Assume that a company uses the accrual basis of accounting. In its first month of operations, it provides $10,000 of services to its clients and allows them to pay 30 days later. It also incurs $2,000 of expenses of which it pays $1,100 immediately and will pay $900 in 30 days. In its first month, the company had a profit of $8,000 (revenues of $10,000 minus $2,000 of expenses), but its cash decreased by $1,100 (cash receipts of $0 with cash payments of $1,100). If it has no other business transactions, the company's profit in the second month will be $0 (no revenues minus no expenses) but it will have a $9,100 increase in cash (receipts of $10,000 minus payments of $900).
Now assume that a different company had a profit of $60,000 in its first year, but paid out $65,000 near the end of the year to acquire equipment that will be put into service on the first day of its second year. During its first year the company had $65,000 of profit, but may end the year with $0 cash.
Other examples where cash is paid out, but the profits are not reduced at the time of the payment, include prepayments of insurance premiums, payments to increase its inventory of merchandise, and payments to reduce liabilities.
To help recognize the difference between a company's profits and its cash flows, the statement of cash flows is one of the required external financial statements.",what
What are the elements of financial statements?,"Definition of Elements of Financial Statements
The elements of financial statements are the classes of items contained in the financial statements. 
Examples of Elements of Financial Statements
The elements of the financial statements include:

Assets
Liabilities
Equity or net assets
Investments by owners
Distributions to owners
Comprehensive income
Revenues
Expenses
Gains
Losses

The above list is based on the FASB's Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No. 6, Elements of Financial Statements, which you may read at www.FASB.org.",what
What is stock?,"In accounting there are two common uses of the term stock. One meaning of stock refers to the goods on hand which is to be sold to customers. In that situation, stock means inventory.
The term stock is also used to mean the ownership shares of a corporation. For example, an owner of a corporation will have a stock certificate which provides evidence of his or her ownership of a corporation's common stock or preferred stock. The owner of the corporation's common or preferred stock is known as a stockholder.",what
What is the accrual method?,"The accrual method of accounting reports revenues on the income statement when they are earned even if the customer will pay 30 days later. At the time that the revenues are earned the company will credit a revenue account and will debit the asset account Accounts Receivable. (When the customer pays 30 days after the revenues were earned, the company will debit Cash and will credit Accounts Receivable.)
The accrual method of accounting also requires that expenses and losses be reported on the income statement when they occur even if payment will take place 30 days later. For example, if a company has a $15,000 repair done on December 15 and the vendor allows for payment on January 15, the company will report a repair expense and a liability of $15,000 as of December 15. (On January 15 the company will credit Cash and will debit the liability account.)
The accrual method of accounting, which is also known as the accrual basis of accounting, is required for large companies. (The cash method of accounting may be used by individuals and some small companies.) The accrual method and the associated adjusting entries will result in a more complete and accurate reporting of a company's assets, liabilities, equity, and earnings during each accounting period.",what
What is the journal entry to record a one-year subscription for a magazine?,"Ways to Record One-Year Subscriptions
Let's assume that the cost of the one-year subscription for a monthly trade publication is $120. Let's also assume the payment is made at the start of the subscription period, and that your company prepares monthly financial statements.
One way to enter the transaction is to debit the current asset Prepaid Subscriptions for $120 and to credit Cash for $120. At the end of each month an adjusting entry would be prepared to debit Subscriptions Expense for $10 and to credit Prepaid Subscriptions for $10. This approach would obviously match the annual cost to each of the 12 monthly periods benefiting from the subscription. However, this is not practical given the small amount involved.
Thanks to the accounting concept of materiality, accountants can ignore the matching principle when the amount is insignificant in relationship to the company's size. Since no investor or lender would be misled if the entire $120 appeared as an expense in one month and $0 appeared in the other 11 months, the following entry would be more practical: debit Subscriptions Expense for $120 and credit Cash for $120 at the time of entering the invoice into the accounting records.
If an annual trade group membership fee is $6,000 and the amount is significant for the company, the company should record the payment as a prepaid asset and then write a monthly adjusting entry for $500.",what
Why is Rent Expense a debit and Service Revenues a credit?,"Why Rent Expense is a Debit
Rent expense (and any other expense) will reduce a company's owner's equity (or stockholders' equity). Owner's equity which is on the right side of the accounting equation is expected to have a credit balance. Therefore, to reduce the credit balance, the expense accounts will require debit entries.
Example of Rent Expense as a Debit
If a company pays $800 for the current month's rent, the company's assets and its owner's equity will decrease. To decrease an asset such as Cash, the company will credit the Cash account for $800. Since every entry must have debits equal to credits, the company will need to debit another account for $800. In this case, the account is Rent Expense. (Eventually the debit balance in the Rent Expense account will be transferred/closed to the proprietor's capital account or to a corporation's retained earnings account.)
Why Service Revenues is a Credit
Service revenues (and any other revenues) will increase a company's owner's equity (or stockholders' equity). Owner's equity which is on the right side of the accounting equation is expected to have a credit balance. Therefore, to increase the credit balance, the revenues accounts will have to be credited.
Example of Service Revenues as a Credit
If the company earns and receives $300 for providing a service, the company's assets and owner's equity will increase. The asset Cash will be increased with a debit of $300. Therefore, another account will need to be credited. In this case Service Revenues will be credited for $300. Service Revenues is a temporary account that will eventually be closed to the owner's equity account.",what
In what order are liabilities listed in the chart of accounts?,"Order for Listing Liabilities
It is logical for a company's liabilities to be organized in the chart of accounts in the same way as they are presented on the balance sheet:

Current liabilities
Noncurrent or long-term liabilities

Order for Listing Current Liabilities
Within the current liabilities classification, the order in which the current liability accounts are listed can vary. Here is a summary of how they might be organized:

Short-term notes payable
Current portions of long-term debt
Accounts payable
Payroll related liabilities
Other accrued expenses
Income taxes payable

Again, the order will vary. For example, some companies will list Accounts Payable as the first current liability account.",what
What are sales?,"In accounting, sales refers to the revenues earned when a company sells its goods, products, merchandise, etc. (If a company sells one of its noncurrent assets that was used in its business, the amount received is not recorded in its Sales account.)
The amounts recorded at the time of the sales transaction is also known as gross sales since there may be subsequent subtractions for sales returns, sales allowances, and early payment discounts. (Gross sales minus these subtractions results in the amount of net sales.)
Under the accrual basis or accrual method of accounting, goods sold on credit are reported as sales (revenue) when the goods have been transferred to the buyer. Usually this occurs before the seller receives payment from the buyer. The sales on credit are recorded with a debit to Accounts Receivable and a credit to Sales.",what
What does crossfoot mean?,"Accountants use the word foot to mean adding a column of numbers. To crossfoot means to verify that the sum of the totals in various columns also agrees to a grand total.
For example, assume you have a table of numbers that shows the sales of five items for the past week. Column A consists of the names of the five items. Columns B through H show the sales of each item for the days Sunday (Column B) through Saturday (Column H). Column I reports each item's total sales for the week. After footing each of the eight columns B through I, a good accountant will verify that the total of the totals in Columns B through H agrees to the total of Column I. This last step is known as crossfooting.",what
What is a credit?,"In bookkeeping and accounting, a credit could refer to the entry on the right side of a T-account. A credit could also be a verb that means the act of recording an amount on the right side of a T-account.
A credit entry in an asset account will reduce the account's usual debit entry.  A credit entry in a revenue, liability, or owner's equity account will increase the usual credit balance.
A credit could also mean your bank has increased your bank account balance. Your bank account is a liability for your bank and when your bank account increases, your bank has a larger obligation to you.
Credit can also refer to loans, such as line of credit, letter of credit, credit rating, as so on.",what
How do you estimate the amount of uncollectible accounts receivable?,"One way to estimate the amount of uncollectible accounts receivable is to prepare an aging. An aging of accounts receivable lists every customer's balance and then sorts each customer's balance according to the amount of time since the date of the sale. For example, assume that all sales are made with terms of 30 days. Let's also assume that Customer A has an accounts receivable balance of $12,000—consisting of $8,000 that was sold 15 days ago and $4,000 that was sold 40 days ago.
The $8,000 will be entered into the column with the heading ""Current"" and $4,000 will be entered into the column with the heading ""1-30 days past due."" After the sorting/entering is done for each and every customer, the columns are summed. The ""Current"" column is likely to be collectible. However, the amounts in the column headed ""1-30 days past due"" might not be 100% collected. The amounts in the column with the heading ""31-60 days past due"" will have a higher probability of being uncollectible. The column ""61-90 days past due"" indicates a still greater likelihood of not being collected. And the amounts in the column ""More than 90 days past due"" will be even less likely to be collected in their entirety.
Examining the details of each of the past due accounts will help you estimate the amount that will likely be uncollectible.
Another way to estimate the amount of uncollectible accounts is to simply record a percentage of credit sales. For example, if your company and its industry has a long run experience of 0.2% of credit sales being uncollectible, you might enter 0.2% of each period's credit sales as a debit to Bad Debt Expense and a credit to Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.",what
What is periodicity in accounting?,"In accounting, periodicity means that accountants will assume that a company's complex and ongoing activities can be divided up and reported in annual, quarterly and monthly financial statements. For example, some earth-moving equipment may require two years to manufacture but the activities will be divided up and reported in quarterly financial statements. A similar situation occurs at a company that develops complex digital systems.
Even a company that manufactures small consumer products will have ongoing activities and costs that overlap two years or more. Again, the accountants will assume that the revenues and costs can be assigned or allocated to the appropriate accounting periods. Hence, the accountants will report the company's net income and cash flows for each accounting period (year, quarter, month, etc.) and the company's financial position at the end of each accounting period.
Periodicity is also known as the time period assumption.",what
What is the entry when a contract is signed?,"Accounting Entry When Signing a Contract
Merely signing a contract does not by itself require a journal entry. In other words, signing a contract for a future transaction does not mean the company is increasing or decreasing an asset or a liability at the time of the signing. Of course, if cash or some other asset is exchanged at the time of the signing, it will have to be recorded.
While a journal entry is not required at the time the contract is signed, significant commitments that are contained in the contract must be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements of the parties to a noncancelable contract.
Examples of No Entry When Signing a Contract
Assume that an electric utility signs a noncancelable contract with a coal company to purchase 100 million tons of coal to be delivered over a one-year period that will begin in three months. On the day the contract is signed, the electric utility does not own any of the coal specified in the contract, nor does it owe for any of the coal, since the coal will not be delivered for at least three months. When the first trainload of coal arrives at the electric utility at least three months later, the utility will record the purchase of only the coal that has arrived and the related account payable.
Likewise, on the day the contract is signed, the coal company does not have a sale of the coal specified in the contract, and it does not have a receivable from the electric utility. Three months later, when the first shipment of coal is delivered to the utility, the coal company will record a sale of the coal and a related account receivable.
If the commitments made by the utility and the coal company are significant, those commitments must be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements of both the utility and the coal company.",what
What are the required financial statements?,"The required financial statements for U.S. business corporations are:

Statement of income. This financial statement is also known as the statement of operations, statement of earnings, or income statement. It reports the corporation's revenues, expenses, gains and losses (except for items stipulated as other comprehensive income) for a period of time such as a year, quarter, 13 months, etc.
Statement of comprehensive income. This financial statement begins with the bottom line of the income statement and then lists the items considered to be other comprehensive income. Some of these items involve currency translation, hedging, and pensions.
Balance sheet. This statement of financial position reports a corporation's assets, liabilities and stockholders' equity as of the final instant of the date shown in its heading (December 31, January 31, June 30, etc.)
Statement of cash flows. This statement reports the major causes for the change in cash and cash equivalents during the accounting period. The cash flows are presented as operating, investing, or financing activities.
Statement of stockholders' equity. This financial statement is often presented as the statement of shareholders' equity, statement of equity, statement of changes in stockholders' equity, etc. It reports all of the changes in stockholders' equity which occurred during the accounting period.

The five annual financial statements must be accompanied with notes to the financial statements. These notes are needed in order to disclose additional information about items that are reported or are not reported in the financial statements.
You can see examples of the required financial statements (and the required notes) for a publicly traded U.S. corporation by searching the Internet for the corporation's name plus the words investor relations. Select Annual Reports (or select SEC filings and annual reports or 10-K).",what
What is ERP?,"In accounting, ERP is the acronym for enterprise resource planning. ERP could be described as a database software package that supports all of a business's processes and operations including manufacturing, marketing, financial, human resources, and so on. In other words, the goal of ERP is to have one integrated system for the entire company.
The integration of all of a company's information from all departments, processes, operations, etc. requires that an ERP system be very sophisticated. This in turn requires a company to commit considerable resources for planning, training, and implementing an ERP system.
Two of the suppliers or vendors of major ERP systems are SAP and Oracle.",what
Is depreciation a source of funds?,"Definition of Depreciation
Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the cost of a business asset to expense over the useful life of the asset. The accounting for depreciation is a debit to Depreciation Expense and a credit to Accumulated Depreciation. As you can see, the entry does not involve the account Cash. Hence, depreciation expense is referred to as a noncash expense.
Example of Depreciation
Assume that a sidewalk florist operates a cash only business. During the most recent year, the florist had cash revenues of $100,000, cash expenses of $70,000, and depreciation expense of $8,000. Therefore, the net income reported on its income statement was $22,000. (The depreciation pertains to a truck purchased in an earlier year.)
Depreciation and the Statement of Cash Flows
The florist's statement of cash flows (using the indirect method) begins with the net income of $22,000. Next, the depreciation expense of $8,000 is shown as a positive amount and is added to the net income to arrive at $30,000, which equals the cash receipts of $100,000 minus cash expenses of $70,000.
Depreciation expense was added to the net income because the depreciation expense had reduced net income but cash was not reduced. In other words, the positive $8,000 of depreciation expense is not a source of cash, it is merely a needed adjustment to convert the accrual net income to the cash provided from the florist's operating activities. 
While the amount of depreciation expense is not a source of cash, it does reduce a corporation's taxable income. That in turn reduces a profitable corporation's cash payments for income taxes (by the amount of the corporation's income tax rate). The savings of income tax payments is equivalent to a source of cash.",what
What is the difference between the Cash Flow and Funds Flow statements?,"The cash flow statement, known formally as the Statement of Cash Flows, reports a company's change in cash and cash equivalents from one balance sheet date to another. The cash flow statement classifies the amount of the change according to operating, investing, and financing activities. The cash flow statement has been required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board since 1988, when it issued its Statement No. 95. You can read about the statement of cash flows at www.FASB.org/st.
Prior to 1988, accountants prepared a funds flow statement. Generally, the funds flow statement reported on the change in working capital from one balance sheet date to another.",what
Why does the fixed cost per unit change?,"Fixed costs such as rent or a supervisor's salary will not change in total within a reasonable range of volume or activity. For example, the rent might be $2,500 per month and the supervisor's salary might be $3,500 per month. This total fixed cost of $6,000 per month will be the same whether the volume is 3,000 units or 4,000 units.
On the other hand, the fixed cost per unit will change as the level of volume or activity changes. Using the amounts above, the fixed cost per unit is $2 when the volume is 3,000 units ($6,000 divided by 3,000 units). When the volume is 4,000 units, the fixed cost per unit is $1.50 ($6,000 divided by 4,000 units).",what
How does the accounting equation stay in balance when the monthly rent is paid?,"How a Rent Payment Affects the Accounting Equation
A company's payment of each month's rent reduces the company's asset Cash. This is recorded with a credit to Cash.
If the payment is for the current month's rent, the second account is to the temporary account Rent Expense which will be debited. The debit to Rent Expense also causes owner's equity (or stockholders' equity) to decrease. Eventually, the balances in the company's temporary accounts will actually be transferred/closed to the owner's capital account (or to a corporation's retained earnings account within stockholders' equity).
To recap the above, the monthly rent payment keeps the sole proprietor's accounting equation, Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity, in balance because it reduces the company's assets and it reduces the company's owner's equity.",what
What is the statement of activities?,"The statement of activities is one of the main financial statements of a nonprofit or not-for-profit organization.
A nonprofit's statement of activities is issued instead of the income statement which is issued by a for-profit business.
The statement of activities focuses on the total organization (as opposed to focusing on funds within the organization) and reports the following:

Revenues such as contributions, program fees, membership dues, grants, investment income, and amounts released from restrictions.
Expenses reported in categories such as major programs, fundraising, and management and general.
The change in net assets resulting from items 1 and 2.

The statement of activities will have multiple columns in order to report the amounts for each of the following classes of net assets: without donor restrictions, with donor restrictions, and total.",what
What are the ways to value inventory?,"Generally, the balance sheet of a U.S. company must value inventory at cost. In other words, a company's inventory is not reported at the sales value. (An exception occurs when a company's inventory consists of readily salable commodities that have quoted market prices.)
Since the costs of products may change during an accounting year, a company must select a cost flow assumption that it will use consistently. For instance, should the oldest cost be removed from inventory when an item is sold? If so, the company will select the cost flow assumption known as first-in, first out (FIFO). In the U.S. an alternative is to remove the period's most recent cost when an item is sold. This is known as last-in, first-out (LIFO). Another option is to use an average method such as the weighted-average method or the moving-average method. Both the LIFO method and the average methods will result in different values depending on whether a company uses the perpetual method or the periodic method. Still another option is to use the specific identification method.
The LIFO cost flow assumption can be achieved by tracking the units in inventory or by using price indexes. When price indexes are used, it is referred to as dollar-value LIFO. (Retailers often use a technique called dollar-value retail LIFO.)
The accountants' concept of conservatism can result in some inventories being valued at less than cost. Hence, an additional method for valuing inventory is the lower of cost or net realizable value. For example, if the net realizable value of a company's inventory has declined to an amount that is less than cost, the company will likely have to reduce its inventory cost. The amount of that adjustment will also reduce the current period's net income.
A company's inventory must be measured and reviewed very carefully as it is an important amount for determining a company's financial position and profitability.",what
What is the difference between unearned revenue and unrecorded revenue?,"In financial accounting, unearned revenue refers to amounts received prior to being earned. For example, if ABC Service Co. receives $24,000 on December 31, 2012 for a one-year service agreement covering January 1 through December 31, 2013, the entire $24,000 is unearned as of December 31, 2012. On the December 31, 2012 balance sheet ABC should report a liability such as Unearned Revenues for $24,000. During 2013 ABC should move $2,000 per month from the liability account on its balance sheet to a revenue account on its income statement.
I associate unrecorded revenue with revenues that were earned, but not yet recorded in a company's accounting records. For example, an electric utility will provide electricity to customers for up to one month before it reads the customers' meters, calculates the bills and records the billings as revenues and accounts receivable. As a result, the electric utility will have up to one month of unrecorded revenue. At each balance sheet date, the utility should accrue for the revenues it earned but had not yet recorded. This is done through an adjusting entry that debits a balance sheet receivable account and credits an income statement revenue account.",what
What is the difference between the accounts rent receivable and rent revenue?,"Definition of Rent Receivable
Rent Receivable is the title of the balance sheet asset account which indicates the amount of rent that has been earned, but has not been collected as of the date of the balance sheet.
Definition of Rent Revenue
Rent Revenue is the title of an income statement account which (under the accrual basis of accounting) indicates the amount of rent that has been earned during the period of time indicated in the heading of the income statement.
The account Rent Revenue is also known as Rental Income.",what
What is the cash flow statement?,"The cash flow statement is one of the main financial statements of a business or a nonprofit entity. (It is also known as the statement of cash flows.) The cash flow statement reports a company's major sources and uses of cash during the same period of time as the company's income statement. In other words, it lists the major reasons for the change in a company's cash and cash equivalents reported on the balance sheets at the beginning and the end of the accounting period.
The cash flow statement is needed because the income statement reports the revenues earned and the expenses incurred using the accrual method of accounting. These amounts are different from the amount of cash received and paid. Also, the company's annual income statements might report 3% of a new building's cost as depreciation expense, but the company may have paid cash for 100% of the building's cost in the year it was constructed. Since cash is critical for a company's operations and decision making, it is necessary to have the cash flow statement.
The cash flow statement is organized into four major sections: cash from operating activities, cash from investing activities, cash from financing activities, and supplemental information such as interest paid, income taxes paid, and significant noncash exchanges.",what
Why would Prepaid Insurance have a credit balance?,"Several situations could cause a credit balance in the asset account Prepaid Insurance. For example, let's assume a company's insurance has a cost of $600 every six months. As a result, the company decides to debit Prepaid Insurance when the amount is paid semiannually. It also prepares an automatic monthly adjusting entry to debit Insurance Expense $100 and to credit Prepaid Insurance for $100. If one of the $600 payments is debited to Insurance Expense (or another account) instead of Prepaid Insurance, the monthly adjusting entries will cause the balance in the Prepaid Insurance account to become a credit balance.
Another possibility is that the company simply failed to pay the insurance company and the monthly adjusting entries caused the balance in Prepaid Insurance to become a credit balance. Whatever the cause of the credit balance in Prepaid Insurance, the account balance needs to be adjusted before issuing a balance sheet. The Prepaid Insurance account must report the true amount that is prepaid (paid but not yet expired) as of the date of the balance sheet. If nothing is prepaid then the Prepaid Insurance account must show a zero balance. If an amount is owed to the insurance company, there should be a liability account with a credit balance for the amount owed as of the balance sheet date.
Because adjusting entries involve a balance sheet account and an income statement account, it is wise to also look at the amount being reported in the income statement account Insurance Expense. You should monitor both the Insurance Expense account balance and the Prepaid Insurance account balance throughout the year. The amount paid to the insurance company that has expired needs to be reported as an expense and the amount that has not yet expired needs to be reported as the asset Prepaid Insurance.",what
"What is the advantage of using historical cost on the balance sheet for property, plant and equipment?","The main advantage of using historical cost on the balance sheet for property, plant and equipment is that historical cost can be verified. Generally, the cost at the time of purchase is documented with contracts, invoices, payments, transfer taxes, and so on.
The historical cost of plant and equipment (not land) is also used to determine the amount of depreciation expense reported on the income statement. The accumulated amount of depreciation is also reported as a deduction from the assets' historical costs reported on the balance sheet. (In the case of impairment, some assets might be reported at less than the amounts based on historical cost.)
The use of historical cost is also a disadvantage to those users of the financial statements who want to know the current values.",what
A credit is not a normal balance for what accounts?,"A credit is not a normal balance for asset accounts, the purchase account under the periodic inventory system, expense accounts, and the owner's drawing account.
Exceptions to this list would be contra accounts such as Allowance for Doubtful Accounts (a contra account to the asset Accounts Receivable) and Accumulated Depreciation (a contra account to depreciable assets). In other words, credit balances are expected for contra asset accounts. Purchase Discounts and Purchase Returns and Allowances (which are contra accounts to Purchases) are expected to have credit balances.
A general rule is that asset accounts will normally have debit balances. Liability and stockholders' equity accounts will normally have credit balances. Revenue accounts will have credit balances (since revenues will increase stockholders' or owner's equity). Expense accounts will normally have debit balances as they cause stockholders' and owner's equity to decrease.",what
What is the difference between expenses and payments?,"Under the accrual method of accounting, expenses are costs that have been used up or have been incurred in the process of earning revenues and/or operating a business. For example, a retailer will report its cost of the goods sold as an expense of the period in which the related sales occurred (even if the retailer has not yet paid for the goods, or had paid for the goods in an earlier period). Some expenses are allocations of a cost that was paid in an earlier period (e.g. depreciation of an asset purchased in a previous year, the allocation of a 6-month insurance premium). Expenses also include costs incurred in the current period that will be paid in a later period (e.g. current advertising that will be paid for in the next accounting period). Interest on a loan is a daily expense even though all of the interest will be paid when the loan comes due in the next accounting period.
A payment is a disbursement of money (usually in the form of a check or currency). Some payments are current period expenses (e.g. current month's rent payment) but many payments are not expenses of the current period. Here are a few examples of payments that are not expenses:

a payment of $100,000 to purchase the land adjacent to a company will never become an expense
payments that are cash dividends to stockholders will never be a corporation's expense
principal payments to reduce a loan payable will never be an expense
payments to remit payroll tax withholdings will never be an expense
payments to reduce liabilities resulting from expenses reported in earlier accounting periods (e.g. payments to reduce interest payable, accounts payable, taxes payable)

Some current period payments will result in expenses in future periods:

payments for construction of a building that will be put into service next year
payments for an exhibit at next year's trade show
payments for services to be received in a future accounting period",what
What is the difference between cost and price?,"Some people use cost and price interchangeably. Others use the term cost to mean one component of a product's selling price. Even the same person might use the terms differently.
For example, in standard costing the price variance of the raw materials refers to the difference between the standard cost and the actual cost of the materials.
In other situations we define a product's selling price as: product costs + expenses + profit.
As these two examples indicate, there can be different meanings for the terms cost and price.",what
How does petty cash affect expenses?,"Definition of Petty Cash
Petty cash is a small amount of currency and coins that a company has available to make very small payments instead of requesting and processing a company check. The amount of the petty cash fund is recorded in a current asset account entitled Petty Cash when the petty cash fund is established.
Example of Petty Cash Affecting Expenses
Assume that the petty cash money is used to pay postage of $10. While the company incurs this cost at the time of payment, it will be recorded in the general ledger account Postage Expense when the petty cash fund is replenished. 
In order to get the expenses entered in the proper accounting period, it is necessary to replenish the petty cash fund at the end of each accounting period. (This is done in addition to replenishing the fund whenever the currency and coins are low.)",what
What is the difference between reserve and provision?,"In the U.S. the use of the word reserve has been discouraged for several decades. In its place, the accounting profession has recommended the use of words such as allowance, accumulated, or provision. For instance, many years ago the contra account to a plant asset may have been titled Depreciation Reserve. To some readers, that name implied that cash had been set aside to replace the asset. To better communicate reality, the accounting profession recommended a more descriptive title such as Accumulated Depreciation. Similarly, the contra account to Accounts Receivable may have been titled Reserve for Bad Debts. Again, that title could imply that money was set aside. To avoid misinterpretation, the accounting profession suggested Allowance for Bad Debts or Provision for Bad Debts.
The word provision might appear in the title of a contra account as we just noted. In addition, provision will occasionally appear in the title of an expense account, such as Provision for Income Taxes.",what
What is the accounting entry when an order is received?,"There is no accounting entry recorded in a company's general ledger accounts when an order is received.
The reason is that a sale or sales revenues has not yet occurred, nor does the company have an accounts receivable at this point. Generally, the sale and the related receivable occur when the goods are shipped (FOB shipping point) or when the goods are received by the customer (FOB destination).
While there is no accounting entry in the general ledger, it is likely that the company will create a record outside of the general ledger to track the order and to schedule various activities that will be needed to ship the products to the customer.",what
What is the abbreviation for debit and credit?,"Abbreviation for Debit and Credit
The abbreviation for debit is dr. and the abbreviation for credit is cr.
Apparently the ""dr."" is associated with the term used in Italy more than 500 years ago, rather than the word ""debit"" which we use today.",what
What is separation of duties?,"The separation of duties is one of several steps to improve the internal control of an organization's assets. For example, the internal control of cash is improved if the money handling duties are separated from the record keeping duties. By separating these duties the likelihood of theft is reduced because it will now require two dishonest people working together to admit to each other that they are dishonest, plan the theft, and to then carry out the theft. One person will have to remove the cash and the other person will have to falsify the records.
Without the separation of duties, the theft of cash is easier. One dishonest person can steal the money and enter a fictitious amount into the records—thereby concealing the theft.
Another step in improving internal control over cash is to use a cash register, issue receipts, and have two people present when cash is handled.",what
What is the difference in salaries between a bookkeeper and an accountant?,"I  estimate that a bookkeeper's salary will be less than half of an accountant's salary. For example, an accountant with a year or two of experience might earn $60,000 per year while a bookkeeper will earn less than $30,000 per year. More experienced accountants will be able to earn higher salaries but bookkeepers will not see significant salary increases. Some explanations for the salary differences are listed below.
Generally, a bookkeeper's formal education will be less than a four-year college degree. Accountants generally have a 120 or 150 credit college degree including at least 30 credits of accounting courses plus 30 credits of other business courses.
A bookkeeper is likely to be employed at a smaller company or organization and will process a large volume of routine transactions. An accountant is likely to be employed at a larger company and will be able to delegate the processing of the high-volume routine transactions to accounting clerks. In turn, the accountant will deal with more complicated transactions, will review the financial statements, and will assist management in the planning and control of the organization.",what
Why are sales a credit?,"The account Sales is credited because a corporation's sales of products will cause its stockholders' equity to increase. A sole proprietorship's sales will cause the owner's equity to increase.
The Sales account is used in order to keep a tally of the sales made during an accounting year. However, when the accounting year is completed, the credit balance will be moved via closing entries to the corporation's Retained Earnings account or to the sole proprietorship's Owner's Capital account.
Recall that asset accounts will likely have debit balances and the liability and stockholders' equity accounts will likely have credit balances. To confirm that crediting the Sales account is logical, think of a cash sale. The asset account Cash is debited and therefore the Sales account will have to be credited. Also the accounting equation will remain in balance because the asset Cash is increased with a debit, and through the closing entries an owner's or stockholders' equity account will be increased with a credit.",what
What does double entry mean?,"Double entry means that every transaction will involve at least two accounts. For example, if your company borrows money from the bank, the company's asset Cash is increased and the company's liability Notes Payable is increased. If your company pays the six-month insurance premium, your company's asset Cash is decreased and its asset Prepaid Insurance is increased. If an employee works for hourly wages, the company's account Wages Expense is increased and its liability account Wages Payable is increased. When the employee is paid, the account Wages Payable is decreased and Cash is decreased.
Double entry also requires that one account be debited and the other account be credited. Accounting software might record the effect on one account automatically and only require information on the other account. For example, if you are preparing a check, the software will automatically reduce the Cash account. Therefore, the accounting software needs only to prompt you for information on the other account involved in the payment being processed.",what
Should inventories be reported at their cost or at their selling prices?,"Generally inventories are reported at their cost. A merchant's inventory would be reported at the merchant's cost to purchase the items. A manufacturer's inventory would be at its cost to produce the items (the cost of direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead).
However, if the net realizable value (NRV) of the inventory is less than the cost, the NRV will usually need to be reported on the balance sheet instead of the cost. Net realizable value is defined as the expected selling price in the ordinary course of business minus any costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. When the cost of the inventory is written down to its NRV, the amount of the write down is reported on the income statement. (In a few industries, such as gold mining and meatpacking, it is accepted practice to report the inventory at its net realizable value.)
Since the unit cost of items in inventory is likely to be changing (think inflation), the costs used for inventory reporting will be based on a cost flow assumption. For example, the FIFO cost flow assumption will result in the inventory being reported at the more recent costs, since the first costs are assumed to have been the first costs out of inventory. Under the LIFO cost flow assumption, the inventory will be valued at the older costs, since the more recent costs are assumed to be the first costs to flow out of inventory.",what
Why is prepaid insurance a short term asset?,"Prepaid insurance is usually a short term or current asset because the prepaid amount will be used up or will expire within one year of the balance sheet date.
The definition of a short term or current asset is cash and other assets that will turn to cash or will be used up or consumed within one year of the balance sheet date. If a company's operating cycle is longer than one year, the definition allows for assets turning to cash, used up, or consumed during the operating cycle to be reported as a current asset.
Often companies are billed in advance for insurance premiums covering a one year period or less. Hence the prepaid amount is usually a current asset.
If a company would have to pay an insurance premium in advance for a period longer than one year, the portion of the prepayments that will not turn to cash within one year (or the operating cycle if it is longer than one year) would be reported as a long term asset.",what
How much do you depreciate an asset and when?,"Depreciation begins when you place an asset in service and it ends when you take an asset out of service or when you have expensed its cost, whichever comes first.
For financial statements, you are guided by the matching principle. The objective is to match the cost of the asset to the accounting periods in which revenues were earned by using the asset. There are two estimates needed: 1) the number of years that the asset will be used, and 2) the salvage value at the end of the asset's use. If an asset has a cost of $100,000 and is expected to be used for 10 years and then have no salvage value, most companies will depreciate the asset at the rate of $10,000 per year. This is known as the straight line method of depreciation.
For income tax purposes in the U.S., the Internal Revenue Service has determined the number of years that various assets will be useful and it assumes there will be no salvage value. The IRS also allows companies to take larger depreciation deductions in the earlier years and smaller deductions in the later years of the assets' lives. This is known as accelerated depreciation.
As you probably noted from the above information, in any one year the depreciation expense on the financial statements will be different from the depreciation expense on the income tax return. However, over the life of an asset, the total depreciation expense will be the same. Accountants refer to this as a timing difference.",what
Why is the distinction between product costs and period costs important?,"The distinction between product costs and period costs is important to:

Properly measure a company's net income during the time specified on its income statement, and
To report the proper cost of inventory on the balance sheet

Definition of Product Costs
Product costs include the costs to manufacture products or to purchase products. If a product is unsold, the product costs will be reported as inventory on the balance sheet. When the product is sold, its cost is removed from inventory and will be included on the income statement as the cost of goods sold. Product costs are also referred to as inventoriable costs.
Examples of Product Costs
The product costs for a retailer will be the amount paid to the supplier plus any freight-in. Product costs for a manufacturer will be the direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead used to manufacture a product.
Definition of Period Costs
Period costs are expenses that will be reported on the income statement without ever attaching to products. Since they are not product costs, period costs will not be included in the cost of inventory. Instead, period costs will be referred to as period expenses since they will be reported on the income statement as selling, general and administrative (SG&A) or interest expenses.
Example of Period Costs
Selling expenses (such as commissions, salaries of sales employees, advertising), general and administrative (general office salaries, rent, utilities, etc.), and interest expense will be reported on the income statement when they are directly related to sales or when they are used up. For example, the insurance premiums that a company pays for nonmanufacturing protection will be expensed in the period in which the insurance premiums expire. (However, the insurance premiums for the manufacturing operations will become part of the product costs as the insurance premiums expire.)",what
How does the purchase of a new machine affect the profit and loss statement?,"The purchase of a new machine that will be used in a business will affect the profit and loss statement, or income statement, when the machine is placed into service. At that point, depreciation expense will begin and there will likely be other expenses such as wages, maintenance, electricity, and so on.
Since the income statement reports only the expenses that match the revenues during the accounting period, the depreciation expense might be very small in the first accounting period compared to the amount spent for the machine. For example, if the machine is purchased half way into the accounting year and its cost was $300,000, the depreciation for that first accounting period might be only $15,000—assuming it has a 10 year life and no salvage value. In the next accounting period the depreciation expense will be $30,000 under the straight-line method.
If the machine is used by a manufacturer, the depreciation, electricity, and maintenance of the machine will be recorded as manufacturing overhead. This overhead is then assigned to the products and will be held in inventory until the goods are sold. When the products are sold, these overhead costs will be reported on the income statement as part of the cost of goods sold.",what
What are gross sales?,"Gross sales are the amounts a company earned and recorded from the sales of its products (and perhaps its services). The amounts originate from the company's sales invoices but the total will be adjusted to the accrual basis at the end of each accounting period.
The gross sales amounts from the sales invoices are recorded in a general ledger account such as Sales. (Any sales returns, sales allowances, and sales discounts should be recorded in separate contra revenue accounts in order for management to see the magnitude of these items.)
Gross sales is also defined as the sales revenues before deducting the sales returns, sales allowances, and sales discounts. (Gross sales minus sales returns, sales allowances, and sales discounts is the definition of net sales.)
A review of the income statement for 19 publicly-traded corporations revealed that only the net amount of sales (or revenues) appeared on the face of the income statements.",what
What is the statement of cash flows?,"The statement of cash flows is one of the main financial statements. It is to accompany the income statement, balance sheet, and statement of stockholders' equity. The statement of cash flows (also known as the cash flow statement) reports

the major sources and uses of cash during the period of the income statement
a reconciliation of the change in an organization's cash and cash equivalents (which are reported on the beginning and ending balance sheets)
supplementary information including the amount of income taxes paid, the amount of interest paid, and significant noncash investing and financing activities (such as issuing common stock in exchange for land)

The statement of cash flow is important because investors, lenders, financial analysts, and others are interested in an organization's major cash inflows and outflows. (This information is not available from the income statement because the accrual basis of accounting requires that revenues be reported when earned and expenses be reported when incurred.)
The statement of cash flows reports cash inflows as positive amounts and the cash outflows as negative amounts. They are reported in one of the three sections of the statement of cash flows: operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities.",what
What is turnover?,"Turnover is used in some countries to mean sales.
Turnover is also used in certain financial ratios. For example, the inventory turnover ratio is calculated by dividing the cost of goods sold during a year by the average inventory during the same year. The accounts receivable turnover ratio is computed by dividing the credit sales during a year by the average balance in Accounts Receivable during the same year.",what
Why is the accuracy of inventory valuation so important?,"Having an accurate valuation of inventory is important because the reported amount of inventory will affect 1) the cost of goods sold, gross profit, and net income on the income statement, and 2) the amount of current assets, working capital, total assets, and stockholders' or owner's equity reported on the balance sheet. In fact, an incorrect inventory valuation will cause two income statements to be incorrect. The reason is the ending inventory of one accounting period will automatically become the beginning inventory in the subsequent accounting period.",what
What are accrued liabilities?,"Definition of Accrued Liabilities
Accrued liabilities are usually expenses that have been incurred by a company as of the end of an accounting period, but the amounts have not yet been paid or recorded in the general ledger.
Accrued liabilities are recorded at the end of the accounting period by means of  adjusting entries. The amounts for some accrued liabilities and their related expenses (or losses) may have to be estimated.
Examples of Accrued Liabilities
Some examples of accrued liabilities include the following:

Services and purchases that have been received, but the vendors' invoices have not yet been recorded in Accounts Payable
Accrued employee wages and fringe benefits
Accrued management bonuses
Accrued interest on loans payable
Accrued advertising and promotion
Accrued product warranty costs",what
What is a sole proprietorship?,"A sole proprietorship is a form of business organization that is owned by one person. The owner is referred to as a sole proprietor.
In accounting, the balance sheet of the sole proprietorship reflects the accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity. Owner's Equity consists of the owner's capital account and also a drawing account. The drawing account is a temporary account in which the owner's current year draws or withdrawals are recorded. (The sole proprietor has draws because he or she does not receive a salary or wages. Hence, the income statement will not report an expense for the owner's work. This means that the net income reflects the total return for the owner's work and investment.)
A sole proprietorship is not legally separate from its owner (as would be the case with a corporation). However, a sole proprietor may be able to register as a limited liability company in order to limit his or her personal liability. Be sure to seek professional advice as to the appropriate form of business for your situation and location.",what
"Under accrual accounting, how are worker comp premiums handled?","Worker comp insurance premiums should be charged to the areas where the related wages and salaries are charged.
Let's assume that the net cost of worker comp insurance after discounts and dividends is 5% of the wages and salaries of direct and indirect manufacturing employees. If for the month of January the direct labor is $40,000, then $2,000 of the worker comp cost should be included as direct labor. If indirect labor for January is $60,000 then $3,000 of worker comp cost should be included as the cost of the indirect labor.
If the general office worker comp rates are 0.2% of the general office wages and salaries, then 0.2% of January's general office wages and salaries will be expensed as worker comp insurance expense.
If the employer remits each month's worker comp cost to its insurance company each accounting period, there will be no prepaid insurance nor will there be a liability for accrued worker comp expense.
If the employer remits worker comp premiums to the insurance company in advance of the cost associated with wages and salaries, the amount that is prepaid as of the balance sheet date should be reported as Prepaid Insurance, a current asset. If the employer has remitted less than the worker comp cost associated with the wages and salaries, the amount owed to the insurance company as of the balance sheet date is reported as a current liability such as Accrued Worker Comp Payable.",what
Which financial statement tells the value of a business?,"None of the financial statements will report the value of a business. The main financial statements (balance sheet, income statement, statement of cash flows, statement of stockholders' equity) may provide some helpful partial information, but they will not report the value of the business.
Two reasons why the value of a business is not included in the financial statements are:

The financial statements are generally based on the company's past recorded transactions. The value of the business will more likely be based on the perceived future transactions.
The accountants' cost principle prohibits a business from reporting some highly-valued assets such as trademarks, brand names, and an effective management team (assuming these were developed internally).

A contemporary example which demonstrates that the financial statements do not reflect the value of a business is a startup company with a promising future. We may have read that a venture capitalist (VC) invested $10 million in a startup. Based on that investment the startup is assumed to have a total value of $100 million. Well the startup's financial statements will not report amounts anywhere near $100 million. Realistically the financial statements will be reporting negative earnings, few assets and little stockholders' equity. The company's value came from the VC's perception of the company's new breakthrough system that is projected to generate amazing future revenues with a limited amount of expenses.
In short, the financial statements provide only some of the information needed when attempting to determine the value of a business.",what
What is the entry when a company lends money to an employee?,"When a company lends cash to one of its employees, the entry will include a credit to Cash and a debit to an asset account such as Notes Receivable from Employees (if a promissory note is involved) or Other Receivables-Advances to Employees (if a note is not involved).
When the company earns interest on the loan, the interest should be credited to Interest Revenue or Interest Income and should be debited to Interest Receivable or Cash.",what
What is the difference between stockholder and shareholder?,There is no difference between stockholder and shareholder. The terms are used interchangeably. Both terms mean the owner of shares of stock in a corporation and a part owner of a corporation.,what
Is it acceptable for companies to use two methods of depreciation?,"Yes, many companies use two or more methods of depreciation.
It is acceptable and common for companies to depreciate its plant assets by using the straight line method on its financial statements, while using an accelerated method on its income tax return.
A company could also be depreciating its equipment over ten years for its financial statements, while using seven years for its income tax return.
Even the depreciation for financial statements could consist of some assets being depreciated using the units of production or units of activity method, while other assets are depreciated using the straight line method.",what
"Is contributed capital a noncurrent asset or a current asset, and is it a debit or credit?","The account Contributed Capital is part of stockholders' equity and it will have a credit balance. Contributed capital is also referred to as paid-in capital.
When a corporation issues shares of its stock for cash, the corporation's current asset Cash will increase with the debit part of the entry, and the account Contributed Capital will increase with the credit part of the entry. If the corporation then uses some of its cash to purchase equipment, its current asset Cash will decrease and its noncurrent asset Equipment will increase.
If a corporation receives equipment in exchange for newly issued shares of stock, the noncurrent asset Equipment will increase and Contributed Capital will increase.",what
What is an asset account?,"Definition of an Asset Account
An asset account is a general ledger account used to sort and store the debit and credit amounts from a company's transactions involving the company's resources.
The balances in the asset accounts will be summarized and reported on the company's balance sheet.
Generally, the asset account balances are debit balances and are increased with a debit entry and decreased with a credit entry.
Examples of Asset Accounts
Some examples of asset accounts include Cash, Accounts Receivable, Inventory, Prepaid Expenses, Investments, Buildings, Equipment, Vehicles, Goodwill, and many more.
Two asset accounts, Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Accumulated Depreciation, are known as contra asset accounts since these accounts are expected to have credit balances.
Asset Accounts Are Permanent or Real Accounts
Asset accounts are referred to as permanent or real accounts since they are not closed at the end of the accounting year. Instead, each asset account's balance at the end of the accounting year is carried forward to become the beginning balance of the next accounting year.",what
What is the difference between reserve and allowance?,"More than 60 years ago, accountants in the U.S. used Reserve for Bad Debts as the title of the contra account associated with Accounts Receivable or Loans Receivable. They also used Reserve for Depreciation as the title of the contra account associated with plant assets. The use of the word reserve led some readers of the financial statements to conclude that money was set aside for replacing plant assets or the uncollectible accounts or loans. To avoid this misunderstanding, the accounting profession recommended that the word reserve have a very limited use. Accountants now use Allowance for Doubtful Accounts or Allowance for Bad Debts instead of Reserve for Bad Debts. In the case of plant assets, Accumulated Depreciation is used in place of Reserve for Depreciation.",what
What is the chart of accounts?,"The chart of accounts is a listing of the general ledger accounts to which amounts can be posted. The chart of accounts is a helpful tool for identifying the best account for recording a transaction.
In some accounting software the chart of accounts may be the means to open new general ledger accounts and to control their position in the financial statements.
Usually the chart of accounts begins with the balance sheet accounts followed by the income statement accounts. The accounts will usually be in the same order as they are presented on the two financial statements.",what
Is the sale of a plant asset recorded in the sales account?,"The sale of a plant asset should not be recorded in the sales account. The sales account is used to report a retailer's sale of merchandise or a manufacturer's sale of products. In other words, sales result from a company's main revenue producing activities.
The sale of a plant asset is a ""peripheral"" activity and does not qualify as sales revenues. Rather, the gain or loss on a sale of a plant asset is reported on the income statement as a separate item. Often this item is included in a section labeled as ""other"" or ""nonoperating."" (The gain or loss is the difference between the proceeds from the sale of the plant asset and the plant asset's carrying value at the time of the sale.)
The proceeds from the sale of the plant asset is reported as a positive amount in the investing activities section of the statement of cash flows.",what
Why does an inventory error affect two periods?,"An inventory error affects two periods because 1) the ending inventory of one period will become the beginning inventory for the following period, and 2) the calculation of the cost of goods sold is beginning inventory + purchases – ending inventory.
We will demonstrate this with some amounts. Let's assume that a company began on December 1. During the month of December it purchased or manufactured $100,000 of goods. At the end of December 31, the company reported that its ending inventory was $15,000. As a result, its balance sheet will report inventory of $15,000 and its income statement will report cost of goods sold of $85,000. In January it purchases $130,000 of goods and at the end of January 31 it reports inventory of $20,000. It will report January's cost of goods sold as $125,000 (beginning inventory of $15,000 plus purchases of $130,000 minus ending inventory of $20,000).
Now let's assume that only one error occurred and it involved the calculation of the December 31 ending inventory. Instead of the $15,000 that had been reported, the true amount of inventory was $19,000. That meant the December 31 balance sheet understated the true cost of inventory by $4,000. It also meant that the income statement's cost of goods sold was not $85,000. Rather, the true cost of goods sold was $81,000 ($100,000 minus $19,000 of inventory). In January, the true cost of goods sold is $129,000 (beginning inventory of $19,000 plus the purchases of $130,000 minus the January 31 inventory of $20,000).
To recap, the December 31 balance sheet reported the incorrect ending inventory and the December and January income statements reported the incorrect cost of goods sold, and gross profit and net income. The true cost of goods sold for December was $81,000—not the $85,000 that was reported. The true cost of goods sold for January was $129,000—not the $125,000 that was reported. That one error in calculating the December 31 inventory cost resulted in December's cost of goods sold being too high and January's cost of goods sold being too low. That in turn meant that the reported gross profit for December was $4,000 too low and January's reported profit was $4,000 too high.",what
At what point are revenues considered to be earned?,"Revenues, which are derived from an entity's main activities such as the sale of merchandise or the performance of service, are considered to be earned when the earning process has been substantially completed.
For example, a merchandiser's sales revenues are considered earned when the goods have been shipped or delivered to the customers and the merchandiser has a right to a collectible accounts receivable. (Under accrual accounting it is not necessary to have received the cash in order to have earned the revenues.) The reason is that the substantial and difficult parts of the selling process (having the merchandise, finding customers, getting customers to place orders, and delivering the merchandise to customers) have been completed. Collecting the accounts receivable is usually an automatic process which requires little or no effort.
General guidance for determining when revenues are earned can be found in paragraphs 83 and 84 of the FASB's Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No. 5, Recognition and Measurement in Financial Statements of Business Enterprises and in an Intermediate Accounting textbook.",what
Can a fully depreciated asset be revalued?,"A fully depreciated asset cannot be revalued because of accounting's cost principle.
Definition of a Fully Depreciated Asset
A fully depreciated asset is one that has accumulated depreciation equal to its cost. Hence, the book value of the asset is $0. Once an asset is fully depreciated, there will be no additional depreciation expense.
Example of a Fully Depreciated Asset
Let's assume that a company purchased a building more than 30 years ago at a cost of $600,000. The company then depreciated the building at a rate of $20,000 per year for 30 years. Today the building continues to be used by the company and it plans to continue using it for many more years. The company's current balance sheet will report the building at its cost of $600,000 minus its accumulated depreciation of $600,000 (a book value of $0) even if the building's current market value is $2,000,000.
Unless there are improvements to the building, there will be no depreciation expense after the 30th year.",what
What are consolidated statements of operations?,"Consolidated statements of operations is the heading appearing on the financial statement also referred to as the income statement. In a small survey of 14 U.S. corporations with stock that is publicly-traded, I found that eight used the title consolidated statements of operations. The other six corporations used one of the following titles: consolidated statements of income, consolidated statements of earnings, or consolidated results of operations. In the case of smaller corporations and sole proprietorships, you will more likely see the heading income statements. Seasoned business owners often refer to this financial statement as the P&L, which is short for profit and loss statement.
The word statements (instead of statement) is used in the heading because publicly-traded U.S. corporations are required to present the income statements for each of their most recent three accounting years.
The term consolidated is used in the heading of the financial statements when the corporation controls several separate legal entities but is reporting the results as one economic entity.",what
What is the definition of net sales?,"The definition of net sales is sales minus sales discounts, sales returns, and sales allowances.",what
Why does a company's profit appear as a credit on its balance sheet?,"The accounting equation and the double entry system provide an explanation why a company's profit appears as a credit on its balance sheet.
Asset accounts usually have debit balances while liabilities and owner's or stockholders' equity usually have credit balances. When a company provides services for cash, its asset Cash is increased by a debit and its owner's equity is increased by a credit. The credit is initially recorded in a revenue account, but revenue accounts are temporary accounts that cause owner's equity to increase.
If the owner withdraws some cash for personal use, the asset Cash will decrease through a credit and the owner's equity will decrease through the debit part of the accounting entry. The debit might initially be recorded in the sole proprietor's Drawing account but this account is also a temporary account that will cause the owner's equity to decrease.
Generally speaking, the credit balance reported in the owner's or stockholders' equity section of the balance sheet reflects the owners' investments in the company plus the profits earned minus the amounts distributed to the owners since the time that the company began.",what
What is a natural business year?,"A natural business year is the period of 12 consecutive months (or 52-53 consecutive weeks) ending at a low point of an organization's activities. For example, a school district will have a natural business year of July 1 through June 30, since classes for the school year end in early June.
A retailer's natural business year might be the 52-53 consecutive weeks ending on the Saturday closest to each February 1. This is a low point of activity as it follows the retailer's holiday season and its January clearance sales. The 52-53 week periods (instead of 12 month periods) will result in an equal number of Saturdays in most of the natural business years (as well as in the 13-week quarters and in the 4-5 week months).
Many companies have a natural business year of January 1 through December 31. On the other hand, some companies are required by government regulations to end their accounting years on December 31, even though it is not the end of their natural business year.
The term fiscal year is associated with companies having financial reporting years that do not end on December 31.",what
What is net?,"In accounting, net usually refers to the combination of positive and negative amounts. For example, the amount of net sales is the combination of the amount of gross sales (a positive amount) and some negative amounts such as sales returns, sales allowances, and sales discounts. Hence, if gross sales are 990 and sales returns are 10, sales allowances are 5, and sales discounts 20, the net sales are 955 (990 minus 35).
Here are some additional examples of net:

net realizable value. The amount to be received in the ordinary course of business minus the costs of completion and disposal.
net property, plant and equipment. The recorded costs of the tangible noncurrent assets used in the business minus the related accumulated depreciation.
accounts receivable, net. The recorded amount of accounts receivable minus the allowance for doubtful accounts.
net cash provided by operating activities. The combination of the cash inflows and the cash outflows from a company's operations (activities outside of its investing and financing activities).
loss on disposal, net of tax. An accounting loss on the sale of a business segment minus the income taxes that were saved (avoided, sheltered) because the loss was also deductible on the company's income tax return.
net income. Revenues and gains minus expenses and losses.",what
How should the cost of a yearly subscription for a newspaper be recorded?,"In theory, the payment in advance for a one-year subscription should initially be recorded as a debit to Prepaid Expenses and a credit to Cash. During the subscription period, you would debit Subscription Expense and would credit Prepaid Expenses. 
For example, if the annual subscription cost is $240 and it is paid in advance, you would initially debit Prepaid Expenses for $240 and credit Cash for $240. If your company issues monthly financial statements, then each month during the subscription period you would debit Subscription Expense for $20 and credit Prepaid Expenses for $20. This results in 1) the matching of $20 to expense on each of the monthly income statements, and 2) the balance sheet reporting the amount that is prepaid or not yet expired.
At a large company, the annual cost of $240 will usually be an immaterial amount. The materiality concept will allow you to violate the matching principle, and to avoid the monthly adjusting entry, by simply debiting Subscription Expense for the entire $240 at the beginning of the one-year subscription period.",what
How do the responsibilities of a bookkeeper differ from those of an accountant?,"I see a bookkeeper's responsibilities as getting the business transactions into the company's general ledger. This involves a tremendous amount of accuracy and persistence in first getting the information and then getting it entered. At smaller companies the bookkeeper is likely to process the payables (receiving suppliers' invoices, verifying them, and remitting the amounts), receivables (billing customers, processing receipts, sending statements), payroll, and other tasks. In larger companies, the bookkeeper's responsibilities are likely to be assigned to an accounts payable clerk, an accounts receivable clerk, and a payroll clerk. Generally, the bookkeeper (or accounting clerks) will not have a four-year accounting degree and will be paid considerably less than an accountant.
Accountants will review the information that the bookkeeper had entered into the general ledger, will prepare adjusting entries, will prepare the financial statements, and will analyze them. The accountant will likely supervise the bookkeeper (or accounting clerks), will be involved in the accounting system, and will review the financial statements with the management and owners of the company. The accountant will also be involved in budgeting of operations and capital improvements, cost accounting, reports to government agencies, and various analyses required by management. Generally, the accountant will have a four-year or a five-year college degree with a major in accounting.
Of course my remarks are a broad generalization. Responsibilities will vary by company and by individual.",what
How many days after a month ends should the bank reconciliation be done?,"The bank reconciliation should be done within a few days after the month ends. The reasons include 1) making certain that the company's Cash account has the correct balance, and 2) making sure that the financial statements for the month include all of the company's transactions. At the latest, the bank reconciliation should be done prior to closing the books for the month.
The bank reconciliation might reveal that some revenues and/or receipts were electronically deposited into the bank account but were not yet recorded in the accounting records. Likewise, there might be some expenses and/or payments that were deducted electronically from the bank account, but were not yet entered into the company's accounts. Further, the bank reconciliation might reveal some errors in the transactions already recorded in the company's general ledger.
To save time and to improve internal control, have the bank reconciliation be performed by someone other than the person writing the checks and/or recording amounts in the general ledger.",what
How do I determine my payroll tax liabilities?,"Your payroll tax liabilities will include the following:

Federal, state, and local income taxes withheld from employees' wages, salaries, bonuses, etc. but not yet remitted.
The unremitted Social Security and Medicare taxes that were to be withheld plus your company's matching of those taxes.
State and federal unemployment taxes not yet remitted. Your state can tell you the rate for your company and the wages to which the rate applies. For example, it might be 5% on the first $9,000 of annual wages and salaries. The federal rate (after credit) is 0.6% on the first $7,000 of annual wages and salaries.

In addition to the payroll taxes, you may have payroll related liabilities for worker compensation insurance, health insurance, 401-k contributions, pensions, vacations, and so on.",what
What is the meaning of systematic and rational allocation?,"Systematic and rational allocation is a phrase often cited in the definition of depreciation. In that context it means that the annual depreciation expense should be based on a formula that is logical and acceptable to other unbiased accountants.
For example, depreciating an asset over a 10-year period with the same amount of depreciation expense each year is systematic and rational. Depreciating the asset on the basis of the number of parts it produces is also systematic and rational. However, determining the annual depreciation expense based on each year's profits is not systematic and rational.
Systematic and rational allocations provide for objectivity and consistency, which are important characteristics of accounting.",what
What is a certificate of deposit?,"A certificate of deposit, also referred to as a CD, is a time deposit at a bank, credit union, or other financial institution. However, the certificate of deposit cannot be withdrawn until an agreed upon date known as its maturity date. If a withdrawal becomes a necessity, the financial institution will assess a penalty—usually the loss of interest.
A depositor will earn more interest on a certificate of deposit than the amount earned on a savings account or money market account. The length of a certificate of deposit could be one month, three months, six months, one year, 17 months, three years, etc. Generally the longer the time until maturity, the higher the interest rate.
A CD that matures in less than one year will be reported by the bank as a current liability, and will be reported as a short-term investment by the depositor (provided the amount is not restricted by the depositor).",what
How are period costs reported in the financial statements?,"Under the accrual method of accounting, period costs such as selling, general and administrative expenses are reported on the income statement in the accounting period in which they are used up or expire. They are referred to as period costs because they are not assigned to products, and therefore cannot be included in the cost of items held in inventory.
If a selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense is prepaid, the prepaid portion will be reported as a current asset. When the prepaid expense expires, it will move to the income statement and become part of that period's SG&A expenses.
Interest expense is also a period cost unless it is determined to be a necessary cost of a self-constructed, long-lived asset.",what
What is burn rate?,"In business, burn rate is usually the monthly amount of cash spent in the early years of a start-up business. Burn rate is an important metric since the new business must spend time and money developing a product or service before it obtains cash from revenues.
If a company has $200,000 in initial cash and its burn rate is $20,000 per month, the company will be out of cash in 10 months unless it raises additional money, begins to generate significant revenues, or reduces its burn rate. Hence, it is important that a start-up business monitor all of its expenditures and avoid payments that will not speed up or increase revenues.
The cash flow statement, formally known as the statement of cash flows, is an important financial statement that can be helpful in computing a realistic burn rate.",what
The balance sheet and income statement are connected.,"In the tip of April 20, I mentioned that adjusting entries almost always involve both a balance sheet account and an income statement account. (For example, the cost of supplies that are no longer on hand is moved from the balance sheet to supplies expense on the income statement. Insurance premiums that are no longer prepaid are moved from the balance sheet to insurance expense on the income statement.) The first accounting course teaches us that the basic accounting equation is Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity. Owner's Equity or Stockholders' Equity is a section of the balance sheet that increases when the company's net income increases.
The point of these observations is the following tip: The number of balance sheet accounts is usually small in relation to the number of income statement accounts. If you can be certain that the relatively few balance sheet accounts have the correct ending balances, you can have some confidence that the bottom line of the income statement is proper. (The income statement may contain errors—perhaps you entered an amount into the wrong account—but the overall net income has a good chance of being correct.)
I received this tip from a CPA named Bob many years ago, when he helped me to delegate some accounting work. I continue to value his insight.",what
Are liabilities always a bad thing?,"Liabilities are obligations and are usually defined as a claim on assets. However, liabilities and stockholders' equity are also the sources of assets. Generally, liabilities are considered to have a lower cost than stockholders' equity. On the other hand, too many liabilities result in additional risk.
Some liabilities have low interest rates and some have no interest associated with them. For example, some of a company's accounts payable may allow payment in 30 days. With those payables it is better to have the liability and to keep your cash in the bank until they become due.
In our personal lives, our first house was probably purchased with a down payment and mortgage loan. That mortgage loan was a big liability, but it allowed us to upgrade our living space. I viewed my mortgage loan liability as a good thing because it allowed me to own a nice home in a beautiful neighborhood.
So some liabilities are good—especially the ones that have a very low interest rate. Too many liabilities could cause financial hardships.",what
Where can I find a sample of a cash flow statement?,"A cash flow statement or statement of cash flows should be presented with a U.S. corporation's annual financial statements.
If a corporation's stock is publicly traded, the statement of cash flows will be included in its annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Form 10-K.
To assist with the preparation of a cash flow statement, we have the following forms and templates:",what
What is a lump sum payment?,"A lump sum payment is often associated with a single amount paid to acquire a group of items. For instance, a corporation might pay $50,000 for the inventory and equipment of a small manufacturer that is going out of business. The transaction did not specify any further details. The $50,000 is a lump sum payment.
Sometimes the term lump sum payment merely indicates a single payment. For example, the maturity value of a bond might be referred to as a lump sum payment in order to distinguish it from the series of semiannual interest payments.",what
Is the sales tax on merchandise purchased for resale included in inventory?,"In our state, sales tax is paid only by the end customer. In other words, a retailer does not pay sales tax on merchandise that is purchased for resale. To avoid the sales tax, the retailer furnishes the supplier with a reseller's certificate, which allows the supplier to not charge the sales tax.
If a sales tax is paid by the reseller and the sales tax could have been avoided, the sales tax would have to be expensed immediately. Costs that are not necessary cannot be recorded as assets.
If the sales tax could not have been avoided, then the sales tax would be part of the cost of the merchandise purchased. If the merchandise has not been sold, the entire cost will be reported as inventory, a current asset on the balance sheet. If the merchandise has been sold, then the entire cost will be reported on the income statement as the cost of goods sold.",what
What does the term organic growth mean?,"Organic growth often refers to the growth in a company's sales that did not occur because of an acquisition of another company. Expressed another way, organic growth is the internal growth or the growth from its existing businesses—not from the businesses it acquired during the period.
For example, a company's sales may have increased 25% during the past year. However, all of the sales increase was the result of having acquired a competitor. Therefore, it had no organic growth.",what
Are fixed assets the same as plant assets?,"I use the term fixed assets to mean the same as plant assets. In other words, I believe that both fixed assets and plant assets refer to the assets reported on the balance sheet as Property, Plant and Equipment.",what
How do you record the sales tax on the purchase of an asset?,"Accountants define the cost of an asset as all of the costs that are necessary to obtain the asset and to get it ready for use.
If your state does not allow an exemption from sales tax for the asset you purchased, the sales tax should be recorded as part of the cost of the asset.",what
Are repairs to office equipment an expense?,"Repairing and maintaining office equipment is an immediate expense. This is true even if the repair cost is a very large amount.
If a large expenditure is made to improve office equipment, that cost would be recorded as an asset and then depreciated over the remaining life of the equipment.
Small expenditures to improve office equipment are usually expensed immediately because of the materiality concept. This means the amount is so small that no one will be misled by having the entire amount appear immediately as an expense rather than appearing as depreciation expense over several years. Often improvements of less than $500 or $1,000 are considered immaterial and are expensed immediately.",what
Are earnings different from profits?,"Earnings and profits are often used interchangeably. Others might make a distinction between the two words.
In the case of earnings per share, earnings means a corporation's net income after income tax expense. However, in another context the word earnings could mean an amount that is prior to income tax expense. Some people might use the word earnings to mean an amount before all expenses are considered.
Some people use the word profits to mean net income before income tax expense, while others use the word profits to mean net income after income tax expense. The term gross profit means sales minus the cost of goods sold.
Knowing that people might use terms differently, you may need to ask the person a question to clarify their intended meaning.",what
What does the cost principle mean for a company's income statement?,"If a company has buildings, equipment and inventory, the cost principle will mean that the amount of depreciation expense and the cost of goods sold expense will be based on the costs when the assets were acquired. If these assets have increased in value, the depreciation and cost of goods sold reported on the income statement will be less than the value of the economic capacity being used up. As a result, the reported net income will be greater than the economic reality.
To illustrate this point let's assume that the cost of a bank building was $10 million and was fully depreciated during its first 30 years of use. The cost principle requires the depreciation expense on the bank's income statement for year 31 (and each year thereafter) to be $0 even if the bank building's market value has doubled. Similarly, a manufacturer using equipment that is fully depreciated will have lower manufacturing overhead and lower cost of goods sold because the current year's depreciation for the equipment is $0.
Generally, the cost principle requires that only the verifiable, historical costs recorded at the time of transactions will appear as expenses on the income statement. Unfortunately those recorded costs may not measure the economic reality that is occurring in the period of the income statement.",what
Should an owner's compensation be recorded as an expense or in the Drawing account?,"If the enterprise is a sole proprietorship, the owner's compensation should be debited to the Drawing account.
If the enterprise is a corporation, the owner's gross compensation should be debited to a salary expense account.",what
Does the accrual method apply to the purchase of equipment?,"The accrual method does apply to the purchase of equipment (as well as applying to revenues and expenses).
To illustrate, let's assume that on December 29 a company ordered and received some equipment to be used in its operations. The payment for the equipment is to be made on February 10. Under the accrual method, on December 29 the company should debit the asset account Equipment and credit the liability account Accounts Payable. (When the supplier or vendor is paid on February 10, the company's asset Cash will be credited and its liability account Accounts Payable will be debited.)",what
Should receipts be recorded using the date the money was received or the date the money was deposited in the bank accounts?,"Cash receipts should be recorded with the date the money was received. For example, a church collects money during each of its services on Sunday, June 4.
On Monday, June 5, the money is counted and is deposited into the church's bank account. The transaction to record the cash and the revenues (remember double entry) should be dated Sunday, June 4, since that is the day of the transaction—the day the church received the money.
The day the money is deposited into the bank account is not the proper date of the transaction. The accounting records should report that the money was received on Sunday, June 4.",what
What if an employee's actual vacation payment is greater than the amount that has been accrued?,"Let's assume that a company's accounting year ends on December 31 and the company has only one employee who worked the full year. The company's handbook specifies that the employee earns 10 hours of vacation for each month worked. However, the vacation hours for the year accumulate. The total vacation hours earned as of December 31 will be paid to the employee on June 1 of the following year by using the employee's June 1 pay rate.
Next, let's assume that each month the company records an accrual adjusting entry that debits Vacation Expense for $200 (10 hours X $20 per hour) and credits Vacation Liability for $200. As a result, the balance in the balance sheet account Vacation Liability at December 31 is $2,400 (12 months X $200, or 120 hours X $20).
On the following June 1, the employee's pay rate is $20.50 which means the employee's gross vacation pay will be $2,460 (120 hours X $20.50). The June 1 journal entry to record the vacation payment is:

Debit Vacation Payable $2,400 (to eliminate the December 31 liability)
Debit Vacation Expense $60
Credit Cash, Payroll Withholdings, etc. for a total of $2,460

Note that the $60 difference was recorded as Vacation Expense in the year of the payment. The financial statements of the prior year were not restated for the $5 monthly differences. The reason is the prior year's monthly amounts were estimates (not mistakes) and the difference is immaterial.",what
How do I record exterior cement work? Is it an asset or an expense?,"If the cement work was done to repair or maintain existing cement work, then the expenditure should be recorded as an expense. Even if the cost is very large, repairs and maintenance must be expensed. The cost of repairs or maintenance cannot be recorded as an asset.
If the cement work is an addition or an improvement (more than repairing or maintaining existing cement work), the cost of the cement work is viewed as a new asset. If the amount is significant, you should record the expenditure as an asset and then depreciate the cost over the useful life. However, if the amount of the addition or the improvement is relatively small, the accounting concept of materiality allows you to expense the entire amount immediately.",what
Is it a requirement for a small business to have a CPA?,"Generally, a small business is not required to have a CPA or certified public accountant. A CPA would be needed if the small business must have its financial statements audited or reviewed in order to obtain a bank loan, to apply for a grant, to bid on a job, or some other unique requirement.
Although most small businesses are not required to have a CPA involved, a small business may engage a CPA to review its internal controls, evaluate accounting software, obtain tax advice, and so on.
Some businesses utilize accountants who are not certified, but are very experienced and effective. You could ask your banker to recommend an accountant who works well with clients such as yourself.",what
Is it possible to have a balance sheet for a single day?,"A balance sheet presents the amounts of a company's assets, liabilities, and owner's equity as of an instant or moment in time within a day. Usually it is the instant as of the end of the day. In other words, you can have a balance sheet each day, but the balance sheet amounts represent the amount at the instant or moment after all of the transactions of the specified day have been recorded.
We avoid saying that the balance sheet is for the day, since the amounts are not for the 24-hour period. For example, the cash amount that is reported on the balance sheet is the cash as of the end of the day. For the day, the cash balance may have been $1000 at 8 a.m., $1200 at 9 a.m., $823 at 10 a.m., $3134 at 4 p.m., etc. Similarly, account balances such as accounts receivable and accounts payable are changing during the day.
If you do prepare a balance sheet as of the end of each day, you will need to make daily adjusting entries in order for the balance sheet to be meaningful. For example, each day more electricity is used and therefore each day there is an additional liability and an expense for electricity.",what
Is a utility bill an expense?,"The utility bill for a retailer or for a service company is an expense. Under the accrual basis of accounting, the utility bill is an expense for the period indicated by the meter reading dates.
A manufacturer's utility bill is more complicated. The utility bill for its selling and general administration will be an expense for the period indicated by the meter reading dates. However, the utility bill for the direct and indirect manufacturing operations is part of its manufacturing overhead. As such, the utility bill will be assigned or allocated to the units produced. In other words, the utility bill will be clinging to the units produced. Some of the utility cost will be clinging to the units in inventory and therefore will be part of the cost of the asset inventory. Some of the utility cost will be clinging to the units that have been sold and will be part of the expense known as the cost of goods sold.",what
How do you record a check that clears the bank months after it was voided? ,"Since you had voided the check months earlier, your general ledger no longer reflects 1) the original credit to the cash account, and 2) the original debit to another account. Now that the voided check has cleared the bank account, you will need to record the check in your general ledger. The entry will be a credit to the general ledger cash account and a debit (or debits) to the appropriate account.
It might be helpful to recall the bank reconciliation rule: Put it where it isn't. The old check, which you had voided, is now on the bank statement, but it is not in the cash account. Therefore, you need to put the check amount into the general ledger.",what
Is the sales tax paid on merchandise that you will resell an expense?,"I believe that most states have sales tax exemptions for merchandise purchased for resale. Check with your state's sales tax department to see if you can obtain a resellers permit to avoid being charged the sales tax by your suppliers.
If you purchase an asset and the sales tax is required, the sales tax should be recorded as part of the cost of the goods or services received. For example, if you were required to pay sales tax on the new company car, the cost of the car will include the sales tax. If you purchased supplies and the cost of the supplies was subject to sales tax, the sales tax is part of the cost of the supplies. If you received services that were subject to the sales tax, the sales tax is a necessary part of the cost of the services.",what
"Why can a retailer record its purchase of merchandise as a debit to purchases within the cost of goods sold, instead of the asset inventory?","Before we explain why companies will record the purchases of merchandise in the Purchases account instead of the Inventory account, let's agree that the objective of the accounting process is to have accurate financial statements. In this case we want an income statement which reports an accurate amount of cost of goods sold, and the resulting gross profit and net income. We need the balance sheet to report an accurate cost of inventory, and the resulting amount of current assets, working capital, total assets, and stockholders' equity. I believe this objective will require some type of an adjustment to the the Inventory account balance and to the cost of goods sold regardless of how the purchases of merchandise were initially recorded.
Now for the reason companies often record purchases in a purchases account. Generally, companies will have a relatively stable amount of inventory and the cost of its annual purchases will be many times the cost of its inventory. This means that most of the cost of its purchases will appear as the cost of goods sold on its income statement. For the minor change in the cost of inventory from the beginning to the end of the accounting period, an adjustment can be made. For example, let's assume that the cost of purchases during the year amounted to $560,000. Let's also assume that the inventory at the end of the year has a cost of $70,000 compared to the inventory cost of $67,000 at the end of the previous accounting year. An adjustment will be entered to debit the Inventory account for $3,000 which will increase the Inventory account balance from $67,000 to $70,000. The credit portion of the entry of $3,000 will cause the cost of goods sold to be reported as $557,000 ($560,000 of debits in the Purchases account during the year minus the amount that increased the cost of inventory: $3,000). After this adjustment, the balance sheet will report the true cost of the ending inventory of $70,000 and the income statement will report the true cost of goods sold of $557,000.",what
What causes a corporation's market value to be greater than its book value?,"One cause of a corporation's market value being greater than its book value is the accountant's cost principle. In order for an item to be listed as an asset on a corporation's balance sheet, the item must have been purchased (or donated). If an item is not listed on the balance sheet as an asset, it will not be included in a corporation's book value. (A corporation's book value is the amount of stockholders' equity reported on the balance sheet, which is the amount of assets reported minus the amount of liabilities reported.)
Often a corporation's most valuable assets were not purchased and, therefore, will not be reported as assets and will not be included in the corporation's book value. Think of the late Steve Jobs and the culture he developed at Apple. He and his team, the innovative culture, the wildly successful brand names, etc. could never be listed on the balance sheet as assets nor directly included in the corporation's book value.
On the other hand, the market does recognize those attributes as being immensely valuable. Hence the corporation's market value was and is greater than its book value.",what
Will I be able to pass the CPA Exam after studying the accounting material on AccountingCoach.com?,"AccountingCoach.com contains introductory accounting material. While you need to master the principles and concepts contained on this website, you will need to master more than ten times the amount of this material in order to pass the CPA Exam.
States and jurisdictions have specific requirements that must be met before taking the CPA Exam. In the U.S. it is common for the requirements to include 150 college credits. The accounting material on AccountingCoach.com is perhaps the equivalent of 3 college credits of accounting, while students obtaining an accounting major will have 30 college credits in accounting courses alone.
You should also know that even with 150 college credits, including 30 college credits in accounting, most people cannot pass the CPA Exam. If you wish to be successful, you will need an aptitude for accounting and business in order to master the complex material included on the CPA Exam.",what
Will the adjusting entry amounts appear in the balance sheet and income statement?,"Absolutely. The adjusting entry amounts must be included on the income statement in order to report all revenues earned and all expenses incurred during the accounting period indicated on the income statement. The adjusting entry amounts must also be included in the amounts reported on the balance sheet as of the end of the accounting period.
In the following accounting period, the accrual-type adjusting entries will usually be reversed. They are reversed or removed because the actual invoices or other documents containing the accrued revenues or expenses will be arriving and will be entered into the accounting records by the bookkeeper or the accounts payable clerk.",what
Why is the Cash Flow Statement identified as one of the financial statements?,"The Cash Flow Statement or Statement of Cash Flows is required as part of a full set of financial statements because of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows.
You can read Statement No. 95 at no cost at www.FASB.org/st.",what
What is columnar?,"Prior to electronic worksheets, accountants had several pads of paper with a varying number of columns (and rows) preprinted on them. The pads of paper were labeled as columnar pads. The preprinted paper in these pads allowed accountants and bookkeepers to easily prepare manual spreadsheets.
With the introduction of VisiCalc (the original electronic spreadsheet) followed by other electronic spreadsheets or worksheets (e.g., Lotus 1-2-3, Excel), the use of columnar pads of paper declined significantly.",what
"If a customer pays for the same invoice twice, should the customer be informed?","I say yes. If you become aware of the double payment when posting the customer's second remittance, I would double check your records to be certain you are not owed money from the customer and would then inform the customer.  If the check was sent in error, I would photocopy the check, document on the photocopy what had occurred, and then return it to the customer.
If you did not notice the double payment when processing the customer's remittance, the customer's accounts receivable record will show a negative amount due for the sales invoice and might even show a negative amount due from the customer. If your company mails statements to its customers, the customer should be able to see its double payment when reviewing the statement.",what
Which financial statement shows a corporation's worth?,"Not one of the financial statements will show a corporation's worth. The balance sheet, income statement, statement of cash flows, and stockholders' equity statement merely provide information to assist financial experts in forming an opinion of a corporation's worth.
In the past, some people mistakenly thought that a corporation's stockholders' equity was the corporation's worth. However, stockholders' equity (or the owner's equity of a proprietorship) is merely the result of subtracting the reported amount of liabilities from the reported amount of assets. Since the reported amounts reflect the cost principle and other accounting principles, the net result cannot be assumed to be the company's worth.",what
Why is a product that sells for $50 reported in inventory at its cost of $40?,"Generally, items in inventory are valued at their cost—not their selling prices—because of the cost principle.
Another reason for not valuing items in inventory at their selling prices is that inventory items cannot be sold without a sales effort. Until that effort is made and an item is actually sold, the company cannot report the $10 increase from $40 to $50. This is referred to as the revenue recognition principle. In other words, only after an item is actually sold can the company report the revenue of $50 minus the cost of $40 for a gross profit of $10.
There are some exceptions to reporting inventory at cost. One exception is industries where no sales effort is required and the extensive effort of production has been completed. In these industries the inventory may be reported at its net realizable value, which is the sales value minus the costs to dispose of the items. The gold mining industry and certain other commodities are examples.
Another exception to reporting inventory at cost occurs in any industry when a product will have to be sold for less than its cost. In that situation the item should normally be reported at its net realizable value. (U.S. income tax rules require conformity between tax and financial reporting. As a result, there are complexities involved.)",what
Our income statement shows wide fluctuations in utilities expense from month to month. I suspect our accounting is not proper. Any suggestions?,"Under accrual accounting, your income statement should report the amount for the utilities used during the period of the income statement. The utility bills tell you the cost of the gas and electricity used between the meter reading dates appearing on the utility bill. For example, if the meters are read on the last day of the month then the utility bills received in early July will tell you the cost of the utilities used during the month of June. It is this cost that your company should report as expense on its June income statement. The amount of the utility bills with meter reading dates of June 30 should be reported as a current liability (accounts payable) as of June 30.
When the utility bills are based on monthly meter readings other than on the last day of the month, it gets a bit more complicated. For example, if the meters are read on the 20th day of each month, then the utility bill received at the end of June will show the cost of the utilities used between May 21 and June 20. The amount of this bill is also the liability amount as of June 20th. Since the balance sheet is dated June 30th (and the income statement is for the entire month of June), an adjusting entry should be made to record the additional liability for the utilities used from June 20 through June 30.
To have the correct amount on the income statement, you need to report the expense for the 30 or 31 days during the calendar month that the utilities were used. To have the correct liability amount reported on the balance sheet, you need to report the cost of the utilities used through the last day of the month that have not yet been paid. The reason for this complexity is that the utility provides the electricity and gas each day, but it reads the meters only on one day per month. As a result you will always owe the utility some amount, even if you have paid the most recent utility bill. In short you will need to make an adjusting entry to get the financial statements accurate under accrual accounting.
You raised an important point. You should discuss this further with your accountant.",what
What is the difference between information and data?,"I was taught that information is useful data. The point is there are lots of data (plural of datum) everywhere, and most of the data will not be useful to a decision maker. Only after the data have been sorted and the relevant portions presented to a decision maker will the data become information.
While that is the distinction that I learned many years ago, I believe that most people use the terms information and data interchangeably. In other words, one person might say data processing and another might say information processing, and both could be referring to the same thing.",what
Should a retailer's delivery surcharges be reported as revenues or as other income?,"I believe that a retailer's delivery surcharges are a price adjustment and should be reported as operating revenues. The surcharges are operating revenues that will be matched with the higher operating expenses such as gasoline. The delivery surcharges should not be reported as nonoperating revenues or other income. Nonoperating revenues or other income items would be outside the main activities of the retailer and would include items such as interest earned or the gain on the sale of a plant asset.
The retailer can record the delivery surcharges in a separate operating revenue account. In other words the sales revenues account could be used to record the revenues excluding the surcharges and then another sales revenue account could be designated as the delivery surcharge revenues account. Those two accounts would then be added together to report total operating revenues.",what
What are generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)?,"Definition of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
Generally accepted accounting principles (commonly referred to as GAAP or US GAAP) are the common accounting rules that must be followed when a U.S. company prepares financial statements that will be distributed to people outside of the company. 
These common rules range from basic underlying principles and assumptions to the detailed rules established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) for complex financial transactions. The FASB has organized the generally accepted accounting principles in its Accounting Standards Codification (ASC).
Why Generally Accepted Accounting Principles are Required?
Generally accepted accounting principles are required so a knowledgeable reader of financial statements is able to do the following:

Compare a company's current financial statements to the earlier financial statements of the same company
Compare a company's financial statements to those of other companies (especially within the same industry)
Understand how a company recognizes/reports revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, etc.

Examples of the Basic Underlying Accounting Principles
The basic underlying accounting principles consist of the following:

Economic entity assumption
Going concern assumption
Time period assumption
Monetary unit assumption
Cost principle or measurement principle
Matching principle or expense recognition principle
Revenue recognition principle
Full disclosure principle
Industry practices

Related to these underlying accounting principles are the following: objectivity, conservatism, materiality, cost/benefit, comparability, consistency, relevance, and timeliness.",what
Are estimates allowed in bookkeeping?,"While bookkeeping involves mostly precise amounts from sales and purchase invoices, cash receipts and checks written, etc. there are situations when estimates need to be entered. This is especially true when monthly financial statements are prepared under the accrual method of accounting. For instance, the monthly bookkeeping entries for depreciation, property taxes, utilities, fringe benefits and more will need to be estimates.
Even the end-of-year financial statements will require some estimated amounts. For example, a company's liability for warranties on its products and its allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable will need to be estimates. Providing an estimated amount is better than ignoring reality and reporting a zero amount.
I recommend that the company's accountant review the estimated amounts that will be entered in the bookkeeping or accounting system.",what
What is the proper use of the words lend and borrow?,"If a company is granted a loan from its bank, the company is borrowing money from its bank, and the bank is lending money to one of its customers. In other words, the bank is the lender and the loan customer is the borrower.
To use your friend's car, you might ask ""May I borrow you car? or ""Will you lend me your car?"" If your friend agrees, you are borrowing your friend's car and your friend is lending his or her car.",what
What is Subchapter S?,"Subchapter S refers to a section of Chapter 1 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code.
A subchapter S corporation, which is also referred to as an S corporation, is a corporation that does not pay the income taxes on its income. Rather, the owners of the S corporation are responsible for the income taxes which pertain to their share of the S corporation's income. Hence, the income statement of an S corporation does not report income tax expense, and the balance sheet does not report income taxes payable.
There are certain requirements in order to elect the Subchapter S status. Learn more about Subchapter S corporations at www.IRS.gov or from a tax professional.",what
How much of the contribution margin is profit on units sold in excess of the break-even point? ,"After the break-even point is reached, the entire contribution margin on the next units sold will be profit...provided the total fixed costs and expenses do not increase.
The reason lies in the definition of contribution margin: selling price minus the variable costs and expenses. Once the contribution margins have covered the total amount of fixed costs and expenses, the entire contribution margin on the next units will go to profit.",what
What is the difference between financial accounting and management accounting?,"Definition of Financial Accounting
Financial accounting has its focus on the financial statements which are distributed to stockholders, lenders, financial analysts, and others outside of a corporation or other organization. Because of the many users, the financial statements must comply with the generally accepted accounting principles, known as GAAP or US GAAP.
Definition of Managerial Accounting
Managerial accounting is focused on assisting management in the operation of the company. This will include analyzing a company's costs, assisting in financial decisions, profit planning, calculating break-even points, capital budgeting, and calculating the costs of existing products in order to value the company's inventory and to determine the cost of goods sold (both to be used on the financial statements).",what
What is public accounting?,"Definition of Public Accounting
Public accounting can be viewed as firms of accountants that serve clients such as businesses (retailers, manufacturers, service companies, etc.), individuals, nonprofit organizations, and governmental organizations.
Public accounting firms range in size from sole practitioners to a few huge international firms that employ hundreds of thousands of CPAs throughout the world. In between are local and regional firms as well as very large national and international firms. 
The people employed in public accounting are often certified public accountants or CPAs. Many accountants leave the larger public accounting firms after several years of experience and become an employee at a business or other organization. In their new position they are referred to as a private accountant, corporate accountant or internal accountant.
Examples of Public Accounting Services
The services provided by public accounting firms vary by the size and the expertise of the firm. Here are some of the public accounting services:

Preparation, review, and auditing of the clients' financial statements
Tax work including the preparation of income tax returns, estate and tax planning, etc.
Consulting and advice involving accounting systems, mergers and acquisitions, and much more",what
What does an accountant do?,"Some accountants are directly involved in preparing an organization's financial statements. This is likely to include maintaining the general ledger and supervising some employees.
Other accountants work with a corporation's management in analyzing costs of operations, products, and special projects. Usually this will also involve budgeting and preparing reports which highlight any variances.
Some accountants work as a corporation's internal auditor while many accountants are independent certified public accountants (CPAs) who audit the financial statements of many corporations and other organizations.
Some accountants and CPAs choose to have their own accounting firm and may focus on assisting small businesses with their accounting systems, financial statements, income tax returns, tax planning, investment decisions, etc.
The above examples illustrate the variety of opportunities that accountants have available. Accountants can also use their formal college education with many types of businesses and organizations such as manufacturers, retailers, financial institutions, accounting firms, government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and more. Many accountants also use their knowledge and experience to become executives and business owners.",what
What is a bookkeeper?,"Definition of Bookkeeper
A bookkeeper is usually employed by a small to mid-size company (or other organization) to process and record the large volume of transactions involving sales, purchases, payroll, collection of accounts receivable, payment of bills, and more. After the recording of the transactions, an accountant or the business owner will review the bookkeeper's work and make the required adjusting entries before the company's financial statements are distributed. 
(Larger companies are likely to have accounts payable clerks, payroll clerks, cost accounting clerks, etc. instead of bookkeepers.)

What a Bookkeeper Should Know
Bookkeepers are not expected to have a four-year or five-year college degree in accounting. However, the bookkeeper must be able to work quickly and accurately. Today's bookkeeper must be comfortable with accounting software such as QuickBooks and electronic worksheets. Being proficient with accounting software allows a bookkeeper to stand out from the others.
Salary Range for a Bookkeeper
The annual salary for a bookkeeper could range from $18,000 to more than $40,000. Some reasons for the wide salary range include the size and location of the company, the bookkeeper's responsibilities, the bookkeeper's experience with accounting and other software, the ability to get things done without supervision, etc. (In terms of an hourly wage, the bookkeeper's pay could range from $9 to $20 per hour.) 
How to Become a Bookkeeper
My suggestion is to first read our free 13-part Bookkeeping Explanation and take our Bookeeping Practice Quiz. Next, you can start studying each of the bookkeeping-related topics found on our Bookkeeping training page.

What is a certified public accountant?,"A certified public accountant, or CPA, is a person who has passed the very difficult CPA Exam and has been licensed by one of the 50 U.S. states (or one of five other jurisdictions). The CPA's license is renewed if the state's requirements continue to be met including continuing professional education credits.
Many certified public accountants work in the field of public accounting in CPA firms ranging from a sole practitioner to a large international CPA firm. However, many certified public accountants leave public accounting while others never enter public accounting. These CPAs can be found working as accountants in manufacturing, financial services, not-for-profit organizations, health care, government agencies, education, and so on.

What is the difference between a bookkeeper and an accountant?,"Before I provide a distinction, you should be aware that some people use the words interchangeably. Even though I was the accountant, treasurer, and CFO of a company, the owner introduced me to a group of business leaders as the bookkeeper. He knew I kept the company's books, so ""bookkeeper"" made sense to him. (Later, I tried to explain to him that he should not introduce me as the bookkeeper...after all I was an accountant with an MBA and CPA.)
Generally, a bookkeeper is a person without a college degree in accounting who performs much of the data entry tasks. This includes entering the bills from vendors, paying bills, processing payroll data, preparing sales invoices, mailing statements to customers, etc.
The accountant is likely to have a college degree with a major in accounting and takes over where the bookkeeper leaves off. The accountant will prepare adjusting entries to record expenses that occurred but are not yet entered by the bookkeeper. (Examples include interest on bank loans since the last loan payment, wages earned by employees that will be processed next week, etc.) Other adjustments to accounts include the calculation and recording of depreciation, establishing allowances for uncollectible accounts, etc.). After making the adjusting entries, the accountant prepares the company's financial statements (income statement, balance sheet, statement of cash flows.) The accountant also assists the company's management to understand the financial impact of its past and future decisions.
The distinction between accountant and bookkeeper keeps changing as accounting software and other software evolves. For many years, companies used the title of accounting clerks for employees doing the tasks formerly performed by bookkeepers. The accounting clerks are usually supervised by an accountant.",what
What is the difference in salaries between a bookkeeper and an accountant?,"I  estimate that a bookkeeper's salary will be less than half of an accountant's salary. For example, an accountant with a year or two of experience might earn $60,000 per year while a bookkeeper will earn less than $30,000 per year. More experienced accountants will be able to earn higher salaries but bookkeepers will not see significant salary increases. Some explanations for the salary differences are listed below.
Generally, a bookkeeper's formal education will be less than a four-year college degree. Accountants generally have a 120 or 150 credit college degree including at least 30 credits of accounting courses plus 30 credits of other business courses.
A bookkeeper is likely to be employed at a smaller company or organization and will process a large volume of routine transactions. An accountant is likely to be employed at a larger company and will be able to delegate the processing of the high-volume routine transactions to accounting clerks. In turn, the accountant will deal with more complicated transactions, will review the financial statements, and will assist management in the planning and control of the organization.",what

Can I take the CPA exam without having a bachelor degree?,"You will need to inquire with your state or jurisdiction about its requirements to take or sit for the CPA Exam. Generally, you will need to have a minimum of 150 college credits, which is significantly more than the typical bachelor degree of 120 credits.
Just as important as being able to take the CPA Exam is whether you can pass the CPA Exam. The CPA Exam is very rigorous and the pass rate is significantly lower than the pass rates for college accounting courses. Students having successfully completed 30 college credits in accounting courses (plus 120 credits of other college courses) find it very difficult to pass the CPA exam.  As a result, students with accounting degrees often enroll in CPA review courses to increase their likelihood of passing the CPA Exam. In other words, you need to ask yourself whether you have the accounting knowledge to pass the CPA exam in addition to meeting your state or jurisdiction's educational requirements.
Our Accounting Career Center provides links to each state's board of accountancy and more details on the difficulty of passing the CPA Exam.",what
What GPA is needed to be hired by a CPA firm?,"There is no single GPA (grade point average) that assures you of being hired by a CPA firm. I have seen firms pass over a student with a near-perfect GPA (3.97 out of 4.0) and hire a student with a 3.2 GPA. This occurred because the student with the 3.97 GPA had demonstrated that he could study but could not relate comfortably with others. The student with the 3.2 demonstrated that he could chair a student/CPA firm dinner and was comfortable being the emcee for the evening. Apparently the recruiters were concerned with having the first student meet with their clients and were impressed with the second student.
Some firms will accept a lower overall GPA if there is an upward trend in the GPA and/or if the GPA for the accounting courses is greater than the overall GPA. One recruiter told me that his firm will not allow him to even consider a student that has earned less than a ""B"" in any accounting course.
The rigor of the college accounting program can also be a factor. For instance, a student earning a 3.7 GPA in a college where half of the grades are A's will not be as impressive as a student earning a 3.4 GPA in a college where only 20% of the grades awarded are A's.
In short, the GPA needed to be hired by a CPA firm will depend on the philosophy, size, and clients of the CPA firm. The required GPA will also depend on the student's ability to work with others, to lead, and to pass the CPA Exam. Other factors will be the student's work experience, outside activities, and more.",what
What is IFRS?,"IFRS is the acronym for International Financial Reporting Standards. IFRS is used throughout the world except in the United States where U.S. GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) is followed.
There is an urgency for the U.S. to adopt the IFRS because of the growth in global financial markets, global commerce, acquisition of U.S. companies by corporations outside of the U.S., multinational corporations having subsidiaries both inside and outside of the U.S., and so on. Since financial statements report two or three years of amounts, the amounts from earlier years will need to follow IFRS in order to be comparative.
Efforts are also under way for a simplified version of IFRS that would apply for small and medium sized privately held corporations.",what
How can I learn bookkeeping at a low cost?,"You can use the Internet to learn bookkeeping at a low cost. For example, you can read clear explanations of debits and credits, adjusting entries, financial statements, bank reconciliation, payroll accounting and more at no cost on AccountingCoach.com. You will also find quizzes and Q&A for each topic as well as a huge dictionary. (Visual tutorials, videos, exam questions with answers are also available at a very low cost.)
After you learn the bookkeeping and accounting rules from AccountingCoach.com I recommend that you learn QuickBooks. QuickBooks (from Intuit Inc.) is the leading software for small businesses in the United States. The website Lynda.com offers training videos on QuickBooks and other software (and more) starting at $25 per month. (We do not receive any affiliate revenue from Lynda.com, Intuit, or any other company.)
After you have mastered the material on AccountingCoach and have learned QuickBooks, strive to find a business, bookkeeping service or not-for-profit organization that will provide you with real-world, hands-on experience. Don't be too concerned about the starting pay since your value will come after you demonstrate your proficiency as a skilled bookkeeper.",what
What is the difference between a bookkeeper and an accounting clerk?,"I envision a bookkeeper as a person employed by a smaller company and being responsible for recording nearly all of its transactions. Hence, the bookkeeper would likely process sales invoices, customers' remittances, purchases, payments to vendors, payroll, monitoring receivables, preparing journal entries, and more.
I view an accounting clerk as a person employed by a larger company and having a more specialized role. For example, a large company may employ one or more accounts payable clerks to process a large volume of purchases and payments. The company may also employ a payroll clerk to process its many employees' pay and fringe benefits. Perhaps an accounts receivable clerk will be employed to focus solely on the company's credit customers. A manufacturer may employ a cost accounting clerk to prepare price quotes and to monitor production information.",what
Can I take the CPA Exam with a bachelor's degree?,"To be eligible for taking the CPA  Exam you must meet the requirements of the board of accountancy in the U.S. state (or jurisdiction) in which you plan to take the CPA Exam.
Most states require CPA Exam candidates to have a minimum of 150 college credits including specified accounting and business courses and to have a minimum of a bachelor's degree from a college or university approved by the state's board of accountancy.",what
Is it a requirement for a small business to have a CPA?,"Generally, a small business is not required to have a CPA or certified public accountant. A CPA would be needed if the small business must have its financial statements audited or reviewed in order to obtain a bank loan, to apply for a grant, to bid on a job, or some other unique requirement.
Although most small businesses are not required to have a CPA involved, a small business may engage a CPA to review its internal controls, evaluate accounting software, obtain tax advice, and so on.
Some businesses utilize accountants who are not certified, but are very experienced and effective. You could ask your banker to recommend an accountant who works well with clients such as yourself.",what
Will I be able to pass the CPA Exam after studying the accounting material on AccountingCoach.com?,"AccountingCoach.com contains introductory accounting material. While you need to master the principles and concepts contained on this website, you will need to master more than ten times the amount of this material in order to pass the CPA Exam.
States and jurisdictions have specific requirements that must be met before taking the CPA Exam. In the U.S. it is common for the requirements to include 150 college credits. The accounting material on AccountingCoach.com is perhaps the equivalent of 3 college credits of accounting, while students obtaining an accounting major will have 30 college credits in accounting courses alone.
You should also know that even with 150 college credits, including 30 college credits in accounting, most people cannot pass the CPA Exam. If you wish to be successful, you will need an aptitude for accounting and business in order to master the complex material included on the CPA Exam.",what
Seventeen years ago I earned an accounting degree. How should I proceed to become a CPA?,"To pass the CPA Exam you will need to review all that you had learned plus get current on accounting and auditing standards that have been issued during the past 17 years.
The first step is to determine your state's educational requirements for taking the CPA Exam. Recent grads usually need to have earned 150 college credits in order to sit for the CPA Exam. You need to determine the requirements for someone graduating in 1991 with an accounting degree. We provide links to the state boards of accountancy within our free Accounting Career Center. If you need to take additional college credits, then you should give thought as to whether it should be for the minimum credits in the discipline of your interest, an MBA degree, or more accounting courses. To assist you, I suggest that you meet with the chairperson of the accounting department at each college that you are considering. Often they have special programs that are designed for a person with your background. Our Accounting Career Center also has direct links to more than 700 college accounting departments in the U.S.
After obtaining the required amount of college credits, many students enroll in a CPA Review course just prior to sitting for the CPA Exam.

What is an outside accountant?,"A company's outside accountant is an accountant who is not an employee of the company. An outside accountant could be a sole practitioner or a member of a firm that provides accounting services to many companies.
It is common for smaller businesses in the U.S. to utilize an outside accountant to assist in the preparation of the annual financial statements and tax reports. The outside accountant may also serve as a business advisor when needed.
Some outside accountants are certified public accountants while other outside accountants are not CPAs. Some of the outside accountants who are CPAs are not qualified to be independent auditors while others do qualify as independent auditors.
Since the outside accountant is not an employee of the client, the outside accountant will prepare an invoice in order to be paid for the services provided.",what
Should I delay graduation for an accounting internship?,"If an accounting internship is optional, there are many factors to consider. The students who have been leaders in their college accounting organizations and have been courted by several CPA firms will likely have job offers without participating in the internship program. Other students with fewer things going for them and who are burnt out from studying accounting theory, may need to actually work in the accounting field before taking another course. For these students an internship is an important opportunity.
When I had advised students on internships, I asked whether they will be graduating in May or in December. The reason for my question involves the firms' busy season which is usually January to April. I believe that an internship that results in a December graduation date is advantageous, while an internship that results in a May graduation date could be a disadvantage. Having an internship that results in a December graduation date is likely to mean having two busy seasons of experience within six months of graduation. This can be beneficial if the CPA firm looks at the number of busy seasons of experience when assigning additional responsibilities, promoting, etc.
As the coordinator of an accounting internship program I often read former interns' comments such as ""I wasn't sure if accounting was for me. After this internship I am now confident that I will be a successful accountant. I also have a new enthusiasm for my remaining classes."" The internship also allowed many students to demonstrate that they were much better than their GPA indicated.
In short, some students will excel in their careers without an accounting internship. Other students will excel in their careers because of their accounting internship.",what

What are the top accounting schools?,"Many colleges and universities use their former students' pass rates from earlier CPA Exams as an indicator of being a top accounting school. I recommend that you expand the criteria for finding the accounting school that is best for you. I recommend that you consider a college that

is accredited by an organization such as AACSB
has admissions criteria that you can meet
is staffed by professional instructors with a passion for teaching
has student organizations in accounting and other areas that will allow you to gain leadership and other skills
has a vibrant campus placement or career services office with a track record of placing accounting students in the professional positions that you seek.

Here's my point. What if many of the top performers on the CPA Exam graduated from universities that are not located near your residence and those universities have extremely high admissions standards? What if those universities allow only a small percentage of its students to enroll in the intermediate and advanced accounting courses and those courses have very strict grading standards? I suspect that the graduates of these programs will have outstanding results on the CPA Exam. Those schools can be labeled as ""top"" but those schools might not be what's best for you. Hence, my suggestion that you look at additional criteria.

What is an Accountant?,"Annual Salary Range
Full-time: $40,000 to $80,000+ 
The range reflects differences in job responsibilities, the size and type of employer, and the supply and demand of accountants in a given geographic area.
Educational Requirement
Accountants are expected to have a bachelor's degree in accounting from a four-year college or university. Of the 120 semester credits needed for the degree, approximately 30-36 of these credits will be in accounting courses such as financial accounting, cost accounting, income tax, consolidations, auditing, and accounting systems. Also required within the 120 credits are business courses such as organizational behavior, marketing, business statistics, computer systems, business law, economics, and administrative policy.
While a bachelor's degree in accounting will qualify you to be an accountant, it will not meet today's requirements for becoming a certified public accountant (CPA). That is why some colleges and universities now offer both an accounting major as well as a 150-credit degree program that qualifies you to take the CPA Exam.

Membership Associations
Accountants can join national organizations with local chapters such as the Institute of Management Accountants, Institute of Internal Auditors, Accounting & Financial Women's Alliance, National Association of Black Accountants, and others. 
Who Hires Accountants?
Many companies are large enough and complex enough to require the ongoing expertise of an in-house accountant. As an accountant, you may find yourself working for a manufacturing firm, a hospital, a bank, an insurance company, or a brokerage firm. Accountants are also employed by federal government agencies such as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Government Accountability Office (GAO). State government agencies and large not-for-profit organizations also hire accountants. 
Tasks and Responsibilities
Being proficient in matters of finance and accounting is just one dimension of being a successful accountant. Employers know this, and will prefer to hire an accountant who, in addition to demonstrating excellent accounting skills, also possesses the following traits:

Pays close attention to details, but does not lose sight of how details affect the bigger picture
Is a problem solver; a strategic thinker
Has a productive curiosity about business systems (why a company is profitable, how it gets customers, etc.)
Has good listening skills
Can communicate complex financial information in a clear, straightforward manner
Is a good supervisor; works well as a member of a team

Some accountants are generalists, while others prefer to specialize in a given area. For example, if you are hired as a cost accountant (or cost accounting manager) for a manufacturing company, you might supervise several cost accounting clerks who work with you to calculate the costs of products manufactured, prepare cost estimates for potential sales of new products, and monitor the cost of raw materials, labor, and overhead. 
Or, you might be responsible for analyzing a large corporation's general ledger account balances and preparing financial statements that comply with generally accepted accounting principles. As such, you would supervise accounts payable clerks and payroll clerks. For this type of accounting, your title might be general ledger accountant, chief accountant, corporate accountant, accounting manager, or corporate controller.
The larger and more complex a company is, the more numerous and varied will be the accountants that are on the staff, with titles such as internal auditor, coordinator of profit plans and budgets, researcher of accounting and tax issues, financial analyst, or tax accountant.
Future Needs
As the world becomes more interconnected via global systems and international commerce, the need increases for accountants to be knowledgeable in international accounting standards as well as new technologies that assist management in making decisions. In short, accountants will need to be life-long learners who work closely with people in such fields as marketing, production, information technology, and e-commerce.",what
What is an Accounting Clerk?,"Annual Salary Range
Full-time: $18,000 to $40,000+ 
The range reflects differences in job responsibilities, the size and type of employer, and the supply and demand of accounting clerks in a given geographic area. (General salary information is available at U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.)
Educational Requirement
Some accounting clerks enter the work force with a two-year associate degree in accounting, while others enter with a high school diploma and an expectation that the employer will provide on-the-job training. Accounting clerks are not expected to have a four-year degree in accounting.
Types of Tasks and Responsibilities
Companies large enough to have one or more accountants on staff are the companies that also hire accounting clerks to assist the accountants with routine tasks. Whereas a bookkeeper is expected to perform a range of basic financial responsibilities, the accounting clerk has a more narrowly focused task, such as a payroll clerk, an accounts payable clerk, an accounts receivable clerk, an inventory clerk, or a cost accounting clerk. 
For example, your primary responsibility as an accounts payable clerk at XYZ Company may be to compare the information on each supplier's invoice to the information on XYZ's corresponding purchase order and receiving ticket. If the information on these documents is consistent, you process the supplier's invoice for payment. If the information is not consistent, you investigate and resolve the differences before payment can occur.",what
What is owner's equity?,"Definition of Owner's Equity
Owner's equity is one of the three main sections of a sole proprietorship's balance sheet and one of the components of the accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity. 
Owner's equity represents the owner's investment in the business minus the owner's draws or withdrawals from the business plus the net income (or minus the net loss) since the business began.
Owner's equity is viewed as a residual claim on the business assets because liabilities have a higher claim. Owner's equity can also be viewed (along with liabilities) as a source of the business assets.
Example of Owner's Equity
If a sole proprietorship's accounting records indicate assets of $100,000 and liabilities of $70,000, the amount of owner's equity is $30,000.
Due to the cost principle (and other accounting principles) the amount of owner's equity should not be considered to be the fair market value of the business.",what
What is the double-entry system?,"Definition of Double-Entry System
The double-entry system of accounting or bookkeeping means that for every business transaction, amounts must be recorded in a minimum of two accounts. The double-entry system also requires that for all transactions, the amounts entered as debits must be equal to the amounts entered as credits.
Example of a Double-Entry System
To illustrate double entry, let's assume that a company borrows $10,000 from its bank. The company's Cash account must be increased by $10,000 and a liability account must be increased by $10,000. To increase an asset, a debit entry is required. To increase a liability, a credit entry is required. Hence, the account Cash will be debited for $10,000 and the liability Loans Payable will be credited for $10,000.
Double Entry Keeps the Accounting Equation in Balance
Double entry also means that the accounting equation (assets = liabilities + owner's equity) will always be in balance. In our example, the accounting equation remained in balance because both assets and liabilities were each increased by $10,000.",what
What are accrued expenses and when are they recorded?,"Accrued Expenses
Accrued expenses are expenses that have occurred but are not yet recorded in the company's general ledger. This means these expenses will not appear on the financial statements unless an adjusting entry is entered prior to issuing the financial statements.
Example of an Accrued Expense
To illustrate an accrued expense, let's assume that a company borrowed $200,000 on December 1. The agreement requires that the company repay the $200,000 on February 28 along with $6,000 of interest for the three months of December through February. As of December 31, the company will not have an invoice to process and will not be paying the interest until it is due on February 28.
Recording an Accrued Expense
Without an adjusting entry to accrue the interest expense that was incurred by the company in December, the company's financial statements as of December 31 will not be reporting the $2,000 of interest (one-third of the $6,000) that the company has incurred in December. In order for the financial statements to be correct on the accrual basis of accounting, the accountant must record an adjusting entry dated as of December 31. The adjusting entry will consist of a debit of $2,000 to Interest Expense (an income statement account) and a credit of $2,000 to Interest Payable (a balance sheet account).

What is equity?,"Definitions and Examples of Equity
Equity has several definitions that pertain to accounting:



Equity can indicate an ownership interest in a business, such as stockholders' equity or owner's equity.
Equity can mean the combination of liabilities and owner's equity. For example, the basic accounting equation Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity can be restated to be Assets = Equities.
Equity can mean an owner's interest in a personal asset. For example, the owner of a $200,000 house that has a mortgage loan of $75,000 is said to have $125,000 of equity in the house.

Balance Sheet: Retail/Wholesale - Corporation",what
What is a liability?,"Definition of Liability
A liability is an obligation arising from a past business event. It is reported on a company's balance sheet.
Liabilities are also part of the basic accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders' Equity. Liabilities are often viewed as claims against the company's assets. However, liabilities can also be viewed as sources of the company's assets.
Examples of a Liability
Examples of a liability include:

accounts payable
loans payable
wages payable
interest payable
customer deposits
deferred revenues",what
What is retained earnings?,"Definition of Retained Earnings
Retained earnings is the cumulative amount of earnings since the corporation was formed minus the cumulative amount of dividends that were declared. Retained earnings is the corporation's past earnings that have not been distributed as dividends to its stockholders.
Are Retained Earnings an Asset?
The amount of a corporation's retained earnings is reported as a separate line within the stockholders' equity section of the balance sheet. However, the past earnings that have not been distributed as dividends to the stockholders will likely be reinvested in additional income-producing assets or used to reduce the corporation's liabilities. 
Where do Retained Earnings Come From?
At the end of an accounting year, the balances in a corporation's revenue, gain, expense, and loss accounts are used to compute the year's net income. Those account balances are then transferred to the Retained Earnings account. When the year's revenues and gains exceed the expenses and losses, the corporation will have a positive net income which causes the balance in the Retained Earnings account to increase. (If the corporation's revenues and gains for the year are less than the expenses and losses, the result is a net loss that reduces the normal credit balance in the Retained Earnings account.) The balance in the Retained Earnings account is also decreased when the corporation declares a cash dividend. 
What is the Normal Balance in the Retained Earnings Account?
The normal balance in a profitable corporation's Retained Earnings account is a credit balance. This is logical since the revenue accounts have credit balances and expense accounts have debit balances. If the balance in the Retained Earnings account has a debit balance, this negative amount of retained earnings may be described as deficit or accumulated deficit.",what
What entry is made when selling a fixed asset?,"Defining the Entries When Selling a Fixed Asset
When a fixed asset or plant asset is sold, there are several things that must take place:

The fixed asset's depreciation expense must be recorded up to the date of the sale
The fixed asset's cost and the updated accumulated depreciation must be removed
The cash received must be recorded
The difference between the amounts removed in 2. and the cash received in 3. is recorded as a gain or loss on the sale of the fixed assets

Example of Entries When Selling a Plant Asset
Assume that on January 31, a company sells one of its machines that is no longer used for $3,000. Depreciation was last recorded on December 31. Also assume that the depreciation expense is $400 per month and the general ledger shows the machine's cost was $50,000 and its accumulated depreciation at December 31 was $39,600.
On January 31, the date the machine is sold, the company must record January's depreciation. This entry debits $400 to Depreciation Expense and credits $400 to Accumulated Depreciation.
Also on January 31, the company must debit Cash for $3,000 (the amount received); debit Accumulated Depreciation for $40,000 (the balance after the January 31 entry); debit Loss of Sale of Fixed Assets $7,000; and credit Machines for $50,000.
The $7,000 loss recorded on January 31 is the result of removing the machine's book value of $10,000 (cost of $50,000 minus its accumulated depreciation of $40,000), and replacing it with $3,000 of cash.
If the cash that the company received was greater than the asset's book value, the company would record the difference as a credit to Gain on Sale of Fixed of Assets.",what
Where does revenue received in advance go on a balance sheet?,"Definition of Revenue Received in Advance
Under the accrual basis of accounting, revenues received in advance of being earned are reported as a liability. If they will be earned within one year, they should be listed as a current liability.
When a company receives money in advance of earning it, the accounting entry is a debit to the asset Cash for the amount received and a credit to the liability account such as Customer Advances or Unearned Revenues.
As the amount received in advance is earned, the liability account should be debited for the amount earned and a revenue account should be credited. This is done through an adjusting entry.
Examples of Revenue Received in Advance
The following are a few examples of revenue received in advance:

An insurance company receiving premiums for protection during the following six months
A magazine publisher receiving money from a subscriber for magazines for the following year
A website design company receiving a client's down payment for future work
A law firm receiving a retainer fee from a new client",what
What is the statement of financial position?,"Definition of Statement of Financial Position
The statement of financial position is another name for the balance sheet. It is one of the main financial statements.
The statement of financial position reports an entity's assets, liabilities, and the difference in their totals as of the final moment of an accounting period.
The structure of the statement of financial position is similar to the basic accounting equation. For a corporation the format will be: Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders' Equity. A nonprofit organization's format will be: Assets = Liabilities + Net Assets.
The statement of financial position must reflect the basic accounting principles and guidelines such as the cost, matching, and full disclosure principle to name a few. Accordingly, the statement of financial position is more meaningful when it is prepared under the accrual method of accounting.",what
How do cash dividends affect the financial statements?,"Definition of Cash Dividends
Cash dividends are a distribution of a corporation's earnings to its stockholders or shareholders. For cash dividends to occur, the corporation's board of directors must declare the dividends.
Examples of How Cash Dividends Affect the Financial Statements
When a corporation's board of directors declares a cash dividend on its stock, the following will occur:

Retained earnings (a part of stockholders' equity) will decrease
Current liabilities (such as Dividends Payable) will increase

When the cash dividend is paid, the following will occur:

Current liabilities (Dividends Payable) will decrease
Current assets (Cash) will decrease

The income statement is not affected by the declaration and payment of cash dividends on common stock. (However, the cash dividends on preferred stock are deducted from net income to arrive at net income available for common stock.)
The statement of cash flows will report the amount of the cash dividends as a use of cash in the financing activities section.",what
What is a balance sheet and why is it prepared?,"Definition of Balance Sheet
The balance sheet is prepared in order to report an organization's financial position at the end of an accounting period, such as midnight on December 31.
A corporation's balance sheet reports its:

Assets (resources that were acquired in past transactions)
Liabilities (obligations and customer deposits)
Stockholders' equity (the difference between the amount of assets and liabilities)

You can view the balance sheet as reporting the assets and the claims against those assets (liabilities and stockholders' equity). You can also view the balance sheet as reporting a corporation's assets and the amounts that were provided by creditors (the liabilities) and the amounts provided by the owners (the stockholders' equity).
A classified balance sheet reports the current assets in a section that is separate from the long-term assets. Similarly, current liabilities are reported in a section that is separate from long-term liabilities. This allows bankers, owners, and others to easily compute the amount of an organization's working capital and current ratio.
The balance sheet has some limitations. For example, the property, plant and equipment are reported at cost minus the accumulated depreciation (except land). If these assets have increased in value, the fair value is not reported because of the cost principle. Also, brand names and trademarks may have significant value, but cannot be reported on the balance sheet unless they were acquired in a business transaction.
The balance sheet should be read with the other financial statements (income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of cash flows, and the statement of changes in stockholders' equity) including the notes to the financial statements.",what
How are the balance sheet and income statement connected?,"Connection between Balance Sheet and Income Statement
The connection between the balance sheet and the income statement results from:

The use of double-entry accounting or bookkeeping, and
 The accounting equation Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity

Basically, the income statement components have the following effects on owner's equity:

Revenues and gains cause owner's (or stockholders') equity to increase
Expenses and losses cause owner's (or stockholders') equity to decrease

Example of How the Balance Sheet and Income Statement Are Connected
To illustrate the connection between the balance sheet and income statement, let's assume that a company's owner's equity was $40,000 at the beginning of the year, and it was $65,000 at the end of the year. Let's also assume that the owner did not invest or withdraw business assets during the year. Therefore, the $25,000 increase in owner's equity is likely the company's net income earned for the year. The details for the $25,000 (revenues, expenses, gains, losses) will be reported on the company's income statement for the year.
Accountants refer to the income statement accounts (revenues, expenses, gains, losses) as temporary accounts because their balances will be closed and transferred to the owner's capital account at the end of the year.",what
What is the meaning of debtor?,"Definition of Debtor
A debtor is a person, company, or other entity that owes money. In other words, the debtor has a debt or legal obligation to pay the amount owed. 
Example of Debtor
If a company borrows $10,000 from a bank, the company is the debtor and the bank is the creditor.",what
How do you report a write-down in inventory?,"Definition of Write-down in Inventory
Under FIFO and average cost methods, when the net realizable value of inventory is less than the cost of the inventory, there needs to be a reduction in the inventory amount. Often the balance in the current asset account Inventory is reduced through a credit to a contra inventory account, which is referred to as a valuation account. The debit in the entry to write down inventory is recorded in an account such as Loss on Write-Down of Inventory, which is an income statement account.
Example of Reporting a Write-down in Inventory
Under FIFO and average cost methods, if the net realizable value is less than the inventory's cost, the balance sheet must report the lower amount. If the amount of the Loss on Write-Down of Inventory is relatively small, it can be reported on the income statement as part of the cost of goods sold. If the amount of the Loss on Write-Down of Inventory is significant, it should be reported as a separate line on the income statement.
Since the amount of the write-down of inventory reduces net income, it will also reduce the amount reported on the balance sheet for owner's equity or stockholders' equity. Thus, the balance sheet and the accounting equation will show a reduction in inventory and in owner's or stockholders' equity.",what
Why are expenses debited?,"Why Expenses Are Debited
Expenses cause owner's equity to decrease. Since owner's equity's normal balance is a credit balance, an expense must be recorded as a debit. At the end of the accounting year the debit balances in the expense accounts will be closed and transferred to the owner's capital account, thereby reducing owner's equity. (At a corporation, the debit balances in the expense accounts will be closed and transferred to Retained Earnings, which is a stockholders' equity account.)
Example of Why Expenses Are Debited
To illustrate why expenses are debited, let's assume that a new company has only one asset, Cash of $10,000, and its owner's equity is $10,000. The company then pays $500 for advertising that occurs at the time of payment. The company must reduce its Cash (which has a debit balance of $10,000) by entering a credit of $500. To comply with double-entry accounting, the company must record a debit of $500, which will be entered in Advertising Expense. Let's also assume this was the only transaction for the year. As a result, the company's balance sheet will report assets of $9,500 and owner's equity of $9,500. As you can see, there are two reasons why Advertising Expense had to be debited:

The transaction required a credit to Cash since this asset account is being reduced. Therefore, there must also be a debit recorded in another account, namely Advertising Expense.
The owner's equity and liabilities will normally have credit balances. Since expenses reduce owner's equity, Advertising Expense must be debited for $500. Therefore, double entry requires that another account must be credited for $500. Since cash was used, the account Cash will be credited. This is logical since this asset's normal debit balance must be reduced.",what
What is the difference between cost and expense?,"Definition of Cost
A cost might be an expense or it might be an asset. 
Definition of Expense
An expense is a cost that has expired or was necessary in order to earn revenues. The matching principle guides accountants as to when a cost will be reported as an expense. 
Example of a Cost
A company's property insurance bill for the next six months of insurance shows a cost of $6,000. Initially the cost of $6,000 is reported as the current asset Prepaid Insurance (or Prepaid Expense) since the cost has not been used up (has not expired).
Example of an Expense
As a prepaid cost such as the $6,000 in the asset account Prepaid Insurance expires, the part that expires will be reported on the income statement as Insurance Expense. If the insurance cost is expiring at a rate of $1,000 per month, then each month the amount in the asset account Prepaid Insurance will decrease by $1,000 and Insurance Expense of $1,000 will be reported on the income statement.",what
What is a temporary account?,"Definition of Temporary Account
A temporary account is a general ledger account that begins each accounting year with a zero balance. Then at the end of the year its account balance is removed by transferring the amount to another account. This is done through closing entries. Temporary accounts are also referred to as nominal accounts.
All of the income statement accounts are classified as temporary accounts. A few other accounts such as the owner's drawing account and the income summary account are also temporary accounts. 
Examples of Temporary Accounts
Temporary accounts include all of the various groups of income statement accounts:

Revenues
Expenses
Gains
Losses

Having temporary income statement accounts makes for easy reporting of each year's details. After the amounts for the year have been reported on the income statement, the balances in the temporary accounts will end up in a permanent account such as a corporation's retained earnings account or in a sole proprietor's capital account. (In a manual system, the balances in the income statement accounts will first be closed to an income summary account. Next, the income summary balance will be transferred to the corporation's retained earnings or to the sole proprietor's capital account.)
A temporary account that is not an income statement account is the proprietor's drawing account. The balance in the drawing account is transferred directly to the owner's capital account and will not be reported on the income statement or in an income summary account.",what
How do you record an owner's money that is used to start a company?,"Recording Money to Start a Sole Proprietorship
If Amy Ott begins a sole proprietorship by putting money into her business, the sole proprietorship will debit Cash and will credit the Amy Ott, Capital. If Amy Ott also lends some money to the business, the entry will be to debit Cash and credit a liability account such as Notes Payable. (If Amy invests an asset other than cash, the business will record the cash equivalent or fair market value of the asset.)
Recording Money to Start a Corporation
If Amy Ott decided to form a regular corporation and invest cash in exchange for shares of the new corporation's common stock, Cash will be debited and the account Common Stock will be credited. (If the common stock has a par value, Paid-in Capital in Excess of Par is also used.) If Amy also lends cash to the corporation, Cash will be debited and the liability account Notes Payable to Stockholder will be credited. (If Amy invests an asset other than cash, the corporation will record the cash equivalent or fair market value of the asset, unless the fair value of the common stock being issued has a more clear value.)
You should consult with your accounting and tax professional as well as an attorney regarding the type of business structure to be used and the pros and cons of investing versus lending to a new business.",what
What are income statement accounts?,"Definition of Income Statement Accounts
Income statement accounts are one of two types of general ledger accounts. (The other accounts in the general ledger are the balance sheet accounts.)
Income statement accounts are used to sort and store transactions involving:

Operating revenues
Operating expenses
Non-operating revenues and gains
Non-operating expenses and losses

Large companies may have thousands of income statement accounts in order to budget and report revenues and expenses by divisions, product lines, departments, and so on. 
Income statement accounts are also referred to as temporary accounts or nominal accounts because at the end of each accounting year their balances will be closed. This means that the balances in the income statement accounts will be combined and the net amount transferred to a balance sheet equity account. In the case of a corporation, the equity account is Retained Earnings. In the case of a sole proprietorship, the equity account is the owner's capital account. As a result, the income statement accounts will begin the next accounting year with zero balances.
Examples of Income Statement Accounts
A few of the many income statement accounts used in a business include Sales, Sales Returns and Allowances, Service Revenues, Cost of Goods Sold, Salaries Expense, Wages Expense, Fringe Benefits Expense, Rent Expense, Utilities Expense, Advertising Expense, Automobile Expense, Depreciation Expense, Interest Expense, Gain on Disposal of Truck, and many more.",what
What is a capital account?,"Definition of Capital Account
In accounting and bookkeeping, a capital account is a general ledger account that is part of the balance sheet classification:

Owner's equity (in a sole proprietorship)
Stockholders' equity (in a corporation)

Examples of Capital Accounts
The sole proprietorship of J. Lee will include the following capital accounts:

J. Lee, Capital, which is increased by J. Lee's investment into the business plus each accounting period's net income, and which is decreased by the debit balance in the account J. Lee, Drawing
J. Lee, Drawing, which is a temporary account that records the proprietor's draws during the year. At the end of the year, the account's debit balance will be closed to owner's capital account

A corporation will likely have the following capital accounts:

Paid-in capital accounts such as Common Stock, Preferred Stock, Paid-in Capital in Excess of Par, which are used to record the amounts received by the corporation when shares of its capital stock were originally issued to investors.
The account Retained Earnings which consists of the amount of the corporation's earnings since the corporation was formed minus the dividends distributed to the stockholders since the corporation was formed.
The account Treasury Stock, which has a debit balance representing the amount paid by the corporation to repurchase its own shares of stock which it did not retire.

Other Information on Capital Accounts
The total of the balances in all of the capital accounts must be equal to the reported total of the company's assets minus its liabilities. Because of the historical cost principle and other accounting principles, the total amount reported in the capital accounts will not indicate a company's market value.",what
Why are revenues credited?,"Why Revenues are Credited
Revenues cause owner's equity to increase. Since the normal balance for owner's equity is a credit balance, revenues must be recorded as a credit. At the end of the accounting year, the credit balances in the revenue accounts will be closed and transferred to the owner's capital account, thereby increasing owner's equity. (At a corporation, the credit balances in the revenue accounts will be closed and transferred to Retained Earnings, which is a stockholders' equity account.)
It may be helpful to think of the accounting equation, Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity, to understand why an asset (shown on the left side of the accounting equation) will normally have its account balance on the left side or debit side. Liabilities and owner's equity accounts (shown on the right side of the accounting equation) will normally have their account balances on the right side or credit side.
Example of Why Revenues are Credited
To illustrate why revenues are credited, let's assume that a company receives $900 at the time that it provides a service and therefore is earning the $900. The increase in the company's assets will be recorded with a debit of $900 to Cash. Since every entry must have debits equal to credits, a credit of $900 will be recorded in the account Service Revenues. The credit entry in Service Revenues also means that owner's equity will be increasing.
If the company earns an additional $500 of revenue but allows the customer to pay in 30 days, the company will increase its asset account Accounts Receivable with a debit of $500. It must also record a credit of $500 in Service Revenues because the revenue was earned. The credit entry in Service Revenues also means that the owner's equity will be increasing.",what
What is stockholders' equity?,"Definition of Stockholders' Equity
Stockholders' equity (also known as shareholders' equity) is reported on a corporation's balance sheet and its amount is the difference between the amount of the corporation's assets and its liabilities.
Generally, stockholders' equity consists of the amounts the corporation had received from the sale of its common and preferred shares of stock plus the earnings of the corporation minus any distributions to the stockholders. In other words, stockholders' equity is one source of the corporation's assets. (The other source are the corporation's creditors as evidenced by the liabilities.) 
Stockholders' equity and liabilities are also seen as the claims to the corporation's assets. However, the stockholders' claim comes after the liabilities have been paid.
Stockholders' equity is also the corporation's total book value (which is different from the corporation's worth or market value).
Components of Stockholders' Equity
The amount of stockholders' equity is reported on the balance sheet as follows:

Paid-in capital. This is the amount that the corporation received when it issued shares of its capital stock with common stock and preferred stock (if any) reported separately.
Retained earnings. Generally this is the cumulative earnings of the corporation minus the cumulative amount of dividends declared.
Accumulated other comprehensive income. This is the cumulative amount of income (or loss) for a few items that are not reported on the corporation's income statement.
Treasury stock. This is a reduction of stockholders' equity for the amount the corporation paid to purchase but not retire its own shares of capital stock.

The changes which occurred in stockholders' equity during the accounting period are reported in the corporation's statement of stockholders' equity.",what
Would you please explain unearned income?,"Definition of Unearned Income
Unearned income or deferred income is a receipt of money before it has been earned. This is also referred to as deferred revenues or customer deposits. The unearned amount is initially recorded in a liability account such as Deferred Income, Deferred Revenues, or Customer Deposits. As the amount is earned, the liability account is reduced and the amount earned will be reported on the income statement as revenues.
Example #1 of Unearned Income
A lawn service company offers customers a special package of five applications of fertilizers and weed treatments for $300. However, the customer must prepay in December for the five treatments that will be done between April and September. When the company receives the $300 in December, it will debit the asset Cash for $300 and will credit the liability account Unearned Revenues. Since these are balance sheet accounts (and since no work has yet been performed), there are no revenues to be reported in December. In April when the first service is provided, the company will debit the liability account Unearned Revenues for $60 and will credit the income statement account Service Revenues for $60. At the end of April, the balance sheet will report the company's remaining liability of $240. The income statement for April will report the $60 that was earned. The $60 entry is referred to as an adjusting entry and the same entry will be recorded when each of the remaining four treatments are provided.
Example #2 of Unearned Income
A company informs a new customer that a $5,000 deposit is required before it will begin work on the customer's special order. The customer gives the company $5,000 on December 28 and the company will begin work on the special order on January 3. On December 28 the company will debit Cash for $5,000 and will credit a liability account, such as Customer Deposits (or Unearned Revenues or Deferred Revenues) for $5,000. No revenue is reported in December for this special order since the company did not perform any work in December. When the special order begins and is completed in January, the company will debit the liability account for $5,000 and will credit a revenue account.",what
What is the accounting equation?,"Definition of Accounting Equation
The accounting equation of a sole proprietorship is assets = liabilities + owner's equity. For a corporation, the accounting equation is assets = liabilities + stockholders' equity.
The accounting equation is similar to the format of the balance sheet.
The accounting equation will always remain in balance if the double entry system of accounting is followed accurately.
Example of the Accounting Equation
Let's assume that a person starts a new sole proprietorship business by investing $10,000. The new business will now have: $10,000 of assets = $0 of liabilities + $10,000 of owner's equity. Next, let's assume the company purchases equipment at a cost of $3,000 and signs a promise to pay the $3,000 within six months. Now the company's accounting equation will contain these amounts: $13,000 of assets = $3,000 of liabilities + $10,000 of owner's equity.
Next, let's assume the new company completes a service for another business and earns revenues of $1,500 and allows the business to pay in 10 days. This means the new company will have an account (or trade) receivable of $1,500 and will have an additional $1,500 of owner's equity. After this transaction, the accounting equation will show: $14,500 of assets = $3,000 of liabilities + $11,500 of owner's equity.",what
What is the expanded accounting equation?,"Definition of Expanded Accounting Equation
The expanded accounting equation provides more details for the owner's equity amount shown in the basic accounting equation. The expanded accounting equation for a sole proprietorship is: Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Capital + Revenues – Expenses – Owner's Draws.
The expanded accounting equation for a corporation provides more details for the stockholders' equity amount shown in the basic accounting equation. The expanded accounting equation for a corporation is: Assets = Liabilities + Paid-in Capital + Revenues – Expenses – Dividends – Treasury Stock.
The expanded accounting equation allows you to see separately (1) the impact on equity from net income (increased by revenues, decreased by expenses), and (2) the effect of transactions with owners (draws, dividends, sale or purchase of ownership interest).",what
What are the effects of depreciation?,"Definition of Depreciation
Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the cost of a company's assets used in its business from the balance sheet to the income statement (as an expense) over their estimated useful lives.
Depreciation occurs through an accounting adjusting entry in which the account Depreciation Expense is debited and the contra asset account Accumulated Depreciation is credited.
Effects of Depreciation
The following are some of the effects for a corporation that is depreciating assets:

The net income, retained earnings, and stockholders' equity are reduced with the debit to Depreciation Expense
The carrying value of the assets being depreciated and amount of total assets are reduced by the credit to Accumulated Depreciation
The depreciation expense reported on the U.S. income tax return (based on the tax regulations) reduces a corporation's taxable income (and its related income tax payments).",what
What is meant by owner's draws?,"Definition of Owner's Draws
Owner's draws are withdrawals of a sole proprietorship's cash or other assets made by the owner for the owner's personal use. The account in which the draws are recorded is a contra owner's capital account or contra owner's equity account since its debit balance is contrary to the normal credit balance of the owner's equity or capital account.
The title of the account for recording R. Smith's draws from his or her business is R. Smith, Drawing or R. Smith, Withdrawals. This account is a temporary account because its balance will be closed at the end of each year. However, the account's debit balance is closed directly to the owner's capital account. (The owner's draws are not reported as an expense on the company's income statement.) 
Example of Owner's Draws
Let's assume that R. Smith, the owner of a sole proprietorship, withdraws $2,000 each month for the owner's household expenses. The company's entry to record each month's draws will be:

A debit to R. Smith, Drawing (an owner's equity account with a debit balance)
A credit to Cash",what
"How, when and why do you prepare closing entries?","Definition of Closing Entries
Closing entries transfer the balances from the temporary accounts to a permanent or real account at the end of the accounting year.
As a result, the temporary accounts will begin the following accounting year with zero balances.
In a computerized accounting system, the closing entries are likely done electronically by simply selecting ""Closing Entries"" or by specifying the beginning and ending dates of the financial statements.
Examples of Closing Entries
Two examples of closing entries are:

The closing of the income statement accounts (revenues, expenses, gains, losses) by transferring their balances to the owner's capital account or the corporation's retained earnings account. This is done after the company's financial statements for the year have been prepared.
The closing of the owner's drawing account by transferring its balance to the owner's capital account.",what
What does overstated mean?,"Definition of Overstated
When an accountant uses the term overstated, it means two things:

The reported amount is incorrect, and
The reported amount is more than the true or correct amount.

As a result of double-entry accounting or bookkeeping, another item is likely to have a reporting error.
Example of Overstated
If a company reports that its prepaid insurance is $8,000, but the true or correct amount of prepaid insurance is only $7,000, the accountant will say that the reported amount of prepaid insurance is overstated by $1,000.
Because of double-entry accounting, if the balance in the account Prepaid Insurance is overstated (too much is being reported) it is likely that the account Insurance Expense will be understated (too little is being reported).",what
What is net income?,"Definition of Net Income
Net income is the positive result of a company's revenues and gains minus  its expenses and losses. A negative result is referred to as net loss. (There are a few gains and losses which are not included in the calculation of net income. However, they are part of comprehensive income).
Net income is also known as net earnings. The details of the net income calculation are reported in the business's income statement.
The net income of a regular U.S. corporation includes the income tax expense which pertains to the items reported in its income statement. The net income of a sole proprietorship, partnership, and Subchapter S corporation will not include income tax expense since the owners (not the entity) are responsible for the business's income tax.
Effect of Net Income on the Balance Sheet
A corporation's positive net income causes an increase in the retained earnings, which is part of stockholders' equity. A net loss will cause a decrease in retained earnings and stockholders' equity.
A sole proprietorship's net income will cause an increase in the owner's capital account, which is part of owner's equity. A net loss will cause a decrease in the owner's capital account and owner's equity.",what
Is sales tax an expense or a liability?,"Definition of Sales Tax
In the U.S., a sales tax is a state tax (and possibly an additional local tax) that is paid by the buyer at the time of purchase. The amount of the sales tax is based on the product and the sales tax rate. For instance, in some states unprepared grocery items are not subject to a sales tax. Items purchased for resale are not subject to the sales tax when purchased by the retailer, but will be subject to the sales tax when the items are sold to the end customer. In some cities, there could be a state sales tax of 6% plus a county tax of 1% and a tourist district sales tax of 3%. In another state there could be only a sales tax rate of 8%.
The sales taxes collected by a merchant are not part of the merchant's sales and are not part of the merchant's expenses. Instead, the merchant is merely an agent of the state and will record the sales taxes collected as a current liability. When the merchant remits the sales taxes to the state, the current liability account is reduced. 
If a company purchases a new delivery van, the sales taxes paid on the van are recorded as part of the cost of the van. The total cost of the van will then be charged to depreciation expense over the van's useful life.
Examples of Sales Tax
If a company sells $100,000 of merchandise that is subject to a state sales tax of 7%, the company will collect $107,000. The journal entry to record this information is:

Debit Cash for $107,000
Credit Sales (or Sales Revenues) for $100,000
Credit Sales Taxes Payable for $7,000

When the company remits the $7,000 to the state, the company will credit Cash and debit Sales Taxes Payable. Note that in this example that the sales tax is not an expense and it is not part of the company's sales revenues.
If a company purchases a new delivery van for $50,000 plus $3,500 of sales tax, the company will record the truck as an asset at its total cost of $53,500. In this situation, the sales tax of $3,500 is considered to be a necessary cost of the truck and will be part of the depreciation expense recorded during the useful life of the truck.",what
How does an expense affect the balance sheet?,"Definition of Expense
An expense is a cost that has been used up, expired, or is directly related to the earning of revenues.
Most of a company's expenses fall into the following categories:

cost of goods sold
sales, general and administrative expenses
interest expense

How an Expense Affects the Balance Sheet
An expense will decrease a corporation's retained earnings (which is part of stockholders' equity) or will decrease a sole proprietor's capital account (which is part of owner's equity).
In addition to affecting retained earnings or the owner's capital account, an expense will also cause one or more of the following changes to the balance sheet:

A decrease in Cash, Prepaid Expenses, Supplies on Hand, Inventory
An increase in the credit balance in the contra-asset account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts or Accumulated Depreciation
An increase in the balance in the liability account Accounts Payable, or an increase in Accrued Expenses Payable (including Wages Payable, Interest Payable, etc.)",what
Where is accrued income reported in the balance sheet?,"Definition of Accrued Income
Accrued income refers to amounts that have been earned, but the amounts have not yet been received. For example, a corporation may have its excess cash invested in an investment security that pays interest every six months. Between the interest payment dates, the company will have:

Accrued interest income that is to be reported on the income statement
Accrued interest receivable that is to be reported on the balance sheet

Accrued Income Reported on the Balance Sheet
The amount of accrued income that a corporation has a right to receive as of the date of the balance sheet will be reported in the current asset section of the balance sheet. It could be described as accrued receivables or accrued income.
The amount of the accrued income reported on the income statement also causes an increase in a corporation's retained earnings, which is part of the stockholders' equity section of the balance sheet.
Balance Sheet: Retail/Wholesale - Corporation",what
Is it possible for owner's equity to be a negative amount?,"Definition of Negative Owner's Equity
Negative owner's equity means the amount of a sole proprietorship's liabilities exceeds the amount of its assets. 
Example of Negative Owner's Equity
Let's assume that an owner invests $100,000 to begin a new sole proprietorship business. At this point, the owner's equity is a positive $100,000. During the first year of operations, the business's expenses exceeded revenues by $108,000 and there were no draws or additional investments by the owner. The owner's equity at the end of the first year will be a negative $8,000.
The negative amount of owner's equity is a problem that will be obvious to anyone reading the company's balance sheet. However, the company may be able to operate if its cash inflows are greater and sooner than the cash outflows necessary for meeting its payments on its liabilities.",what
What is a customer deposit?,"Definition of Customer Deposit
A customer deposit could be money that a company receives from a customer prior to the company earning it (by providing the customer with goods or services). In other words, the company receives the asset Cash and has an obligation to provide the goods or services to the customer or to return the money. Hence, the current liability account Customer Deposits is credited. When the company earns the deposit amount, the current liability will be debited and Sales Revenues will be credited.
A customer deposit could also refer to the money a bank receives from a depositor. Since the bank is not earning this money, the amount is recorded by the bank with a debit to Cash and a credit to Customer Deposits.
Example of Customer Deposit
Let's assume that Ace Manufacturing Inc. agrees to produce an expensive, custom-made machine for one of its customers. Ace requires that the customer pay $50,000 before Ace begins to design and construct the machine. The $50,000 payment is made in December 2018 and the machine must be finished by March 31, 2019. The $50,000 is a down payment toward the machine's price of $400,000.
In December 2018 Ace will debit Cash for $50,000 and will credit Customer Deposits, a current liability account. When the machine is completed in 2019, Ace will debit Customer Deposits for $50,000 and will credit Sales Revenues for $50,000.",what
Why are assets and expenses increased with a debit?,"Let's use two transactions to illustrate why assets and expenses are increased with a debit: 1) A company pays $25,000 for a new delivery van, and 2) A company pays $800 for the current month's rent.
In both of the transactions the company pays cash at the time of the transaction. In each of the transactions the Cash account is credited. Therefore, each transaction will require a debit to another account. (Recall that double-entry bookkeeping requires at least one debit and one credit when recording a transaction.)
In the first transaction, the debit will be to a long term asset account such as Delivery Vehicles. In this transaction the asset Delivery Vehicles was increased with a debit and the asset Cash was decreased with a credit. The accounting equation (A=L+OE) remains in balance because one asset increased by $25,000 and one asset decreased by $25,000.
In the second transaction, the debit will be to Rent Expense since the amount will be used up in the current accounting period. (If the amount was a prepayment of a future period's rent, the amount would have been debited to the asset account Prepaid Rent.) Since Rent Expense reduces net income, it  also reduces owner's or stockholders' equity, which normally have credit balances. The accounting equation will show assets decreasing by the reduction in cash and owner's or stockholders' equity decreasing because of the expense.
The asset Delivery Vehicle is an asset, but will become Depreciation Expense over the life of the vehicle. The rent is an immediate expense because there is no future accounting period benefiting from the current month's rent.",what
What are accrued revenues and when are they recorded?,"Accrued revenues are fees and interest that have been earned and sales that occurred, but they have not yet been recorded through the normal invoicing paperwork. Since these are not yet in the accountant's general ledger, they will not appear on the financial statements unless an adjusting entry is entered prior to preparing the financial statements.
Here's an example. Your company lent a supplier $100,000 on December 1. The agreement is for the $100,000 to be repaid on February 28 along with $3,000 of interest for the three months of December through February. As of December 31 your company will not have a transaction/invoice/receipt for the interest it is earning since all of the interest is due on February 28. Without an adjusting entry to accrue the revenue it earned in December, your company's financial statements as of December 31 will not be reporting the $1,000 (one-third of the $3,000 of interest) that it has earned in December. In order for the financial statements to be correct on the accrual basis of accounting, the accountant needs to record an adjusting entry dated as of December 31. The adjusting entry will consist of a debit of $1,000 to Interest Receivable (a balance sheet account) and a credit of $1,000 to Interest Income or Interest Revenue (income statement accounts).",what
"If inventory is understated at the end of the year, what is the effect on net income?","If inventory is understated at the end of the year, the net income for the year is also understated.
Here's a brief explanation. If a company has a cost of goods available of $100,000 and it assigns too little of that cost to inventory, then too much of that cost will appear on the income statement as the cost of goods sold. Too much cost on the income statement will mean too little net income.
Another way to view this is through the accounting equation, Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity. If you assign too little of the cost of goods available to Assets, then the amount of Owner's Equity will be too little—caused by net income being too little.",what
What is the accounting entry to close the sole proprietorship drawing account?,"Definition of Sole Proprietorship Drawing Account
The drawing or withdrawal account for a sole proprietorship is a temporary owner equity's account that is closed at the end of the accounting year. The drawing account is also a contra account to owner's equity, because the drawing account's debit balance is contrary to the normal credit balance for an owner's equity account.
At the end of the accounting year, the drawing account is closed directly to the capital account with an entry that debits the owner's capital account and credits the owner's drawing account. Please note that the owner's drawing account is not an expense and as a result it does not get closed to the Income Summary account nor will the amount appear on the company's income statement.
Example of the Entry to Close the Drawing Account
Let's assume that at the end of the accounting year the account Eve Jones, Drawing has a debit balance of $24,000. This balance is the result of Eve withdrawing $2,000 per month from her sole proprietorship for her personal use. (The monthly withdrawals were recorded with a debit to Eve Jones, Drawing and a credit to Cash.) The journal entry to close the drawing account at the end of the accounting year will credit Eve Jones, Drawing for $24,000 and will debit Eve Jones, Capital for $24,000.",what
What is the difference between a balance sheet of a nonprofit organization and a for-profit business?,"A main difference is the section that presents the difference between the total assets and total liabilities. The nonprofit's statement of financial position refers to this section as net assets, whereas the for-profit business will refer to this section as owner's equity or stockholders' equity. The reason is the nonprofit does not have owners. This means that the nonprofit organization's statement of financial position will reflect this equation: assets – liabilities = net assets.
The net assets section will consist of the following parts: net assets without donor restrictions and net assets with donor restrictions. The amounts reported in each of these parts are obviously based on the donor's stipulations.",what
Why is the P&L profit entered on the credit side of the balance sheet?,"Profit's Effect on the Balance Sheet
The profit or net income belongs to the owner of a sole proprietorship or to the stockholders of a corporation.
If a company prepares its balance sheet in the account form, it means that the assets are presented on the left side or debit side. The liabilities and owner's equity (or stockholders' equity) are presented on the right side or credit side.
Recall that the balance sheet reflects the accounting equation, Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity.
Example of Profit's Effect on the Balance Sheet
Assume that you own and operate a sole proprietorship. You provided a service to a client and earned revenues of $900 and had no expenses. One of the business assets (cash or accounts receivable) increased and the liabilities did not change. As a result, the owner's equity (the owner's capital account) increases.
Accountants do prepare an income statement or P&L to report the revenues and expenses, but the ultimate effect of a positive amount of profit or net income is to increase the business's assets and owner's equity.",what
"If a company earns a profit, which balance sheet items change?","Definition of Profit
Profit is the result of revenues minus expenses.
How Profits Change the Balance Sheet
Since all business transactions affect at least two accounts, there will likely be an enormous number of changes to the balance sheet. Here are some of the changes:

Owner's equity or stockholders' equity will increase by the positive amount of net income
Accounts receivable will change by the amount of sales/services provided with credit terms
Inventory will decrease when goods are sold
Cash will increase when goods are sold for cash and when accounts receivable are collected
Cash will decrease when cash is paid for expenses, inventory, equipment, liabilities, etc.
Accounts payable will increase for expenses that were not paid with cash
Accumulated depreciation will change when an asset is depreciated

Again, the list is just a few of the balance sheet changes that may occur when a company has profitable operations.",what
What does understated mean?,"When an accountant says that an amount is understated, it means two things:

The amount is not the correct amount, and
The amount is less than the true amount.  In other words, the amount is too small.

To illustrate the term understated, let's assume that a company is reporting its accounts payable as $21,000. Let's also assume that the correct or true amount of accounts payable is $23,000. An accountant will say that the reported amount of $21,000 is understated by $2,000.
Because of double-entry bookkeeping or accounting there will also be a second general ledger account with an error for the same amount.",what
What is the book value per share of stock?,"If a corporation does not have preferred stock outstanding, the book value per share of stock is a corporation's total amount of stockholders' equity divided by the number of common shares of stock outstanding on that date.
For example, if a corporation without preferred stock has stockholders' equity on December 31 of $12,421,000 and it has 1,000,000 shares of common stock outstanding on that date, its book value per share is $12.42.
Keep in mind that the book value per share will not be the same as the market value per share. One reason is that a corporation's stockholders' equity is simply the difference between the total amount of assets reported on the balance sheet and the total amount of liabilities reported. Noncurrent assets are generally reported at original cost less accumulated depreciation and some valuable assets such as trade names might not be listed on the balance sheet.",what
Why is Rent Expense a debit and Service Revenues a credit?,"Why Rent Expense is a Debit
Rent expense (and any other expense) will reduce a company's owner's equity (or stockholders' equity). Owner's equity which is on the right side of the accounting equation is expected to have a credit balance. Therefore, to reduce the credit balance, the expense accounts will require debit entries.
Example of Rent Expense as a Debit
If a company pays $800 for the current month's rent, the company's assets and its owner's equity will decrease. To decrease an asset such as Cash, the company will credit the Cash account for $800. Since every entry must have debits equal to credits, the company will need to debit another account for $800. In this case, the account is Rent Expense. (Eventually the debit balance in the Rent Expense account will be transferred/closed to the proprietor's capital account or to a corporation's retained earnings account.)
Why Service Revenues is a Credit
Service revenues (and any other revenues) will increase a company's owner's equity (or stockholders' equity). Owner's equity which is on the right side of the accounting equation is expected to have a credit balance. Therefore, to increase the credit balance, the revenues accounts will have to be credited.
Example of Service Revenues as a Credit
If the company earns and receives $300 for providing a service, the company's assets and owner's equity will increase. The asset Cash will be increased with a debit of $300. Therefore, another account will need to be credited. In this case Service Revenues will be credited for $300. Service Revenues is a temporary account that will eventually be closed to the owner's equity account.",what
Is it okay to have negative amounts in the equity section of the balance sheet?,"Definition of Equity Section of the Balance Sheet
The equity section of the balance sheet is known as:

Owner's equity if it is a sole proprietorship. The amount may be reported as a single amount described as owner's capital. On the other hand, it is common for today's accounting software to show three amounts: owner's capital at the start of the year, current year net income, and current year draws by the owner.
Stockholders' equity if it is a corporation. The reported components may be paid-in capital, retained earnings, treasury stock, and accumulated other comprehensive income.

Examples of Negative Amounts in the Equity Section
If the current year's net income is reported as a separate line in the owner's equity or stockholders' equity sections of the balance sheet, a negative amount of net income must be reported. The negative net income occurs when the current year's revenues are less than the current year's expenses.
If the cumulative earnings minus the cumulative dividends declared result in a negative amount, there will be a negative amount of retained earnings. This negative (or positive) amount of retained earnings is reported as a separate line within stockholders' equity.
The owner's drawing account in a sole proprietorship will have a debit balance. Hence, if it is reported as a separate line, it is reported as a negative amount since the owner's equity section of the balance sheet normally has credit balances.
If a corporation has purchased its own shares of stock the cost is recorded as a debit in the account Treasury Stock. The debit balance will be reported as a negative amount in the stockholders' equity section, since this section normally has credit balances. 
Accumulated other comprehensive income can also be a negative (or positive) amount.",what
What is a credit?,"In bookkeeping and accounting, a credit could refer to the entry on the right side of a T-account. A credit could also be a verb that means the act of recording an amount on the right side of a T-account.
A credit entry in an asset account will reduce the account's usual debit entry.  A credit entry in a revenue, liability, or owner's equity account will increase the usual credit balance.
A credit could also mean your bank has increased your bank account balance. Your bank account is a liability for your bank and when your bank account increases, your bank has a larger obligation to you.
Credit can also refer to loans, such as line of credit, letter of credit, credit rating, as so on.",what
What are some tips to make learning debits and credits easy?,"Here are five tips to make learning debits and credits easier:

The accounts for expenses are nearly always debited. For example, when a company pays its monthly rent, it debits Rent Expense. If it runs an ad on the radio, it will debit Advertising Expense.
The accounts for revenues are almost always credited. When a bakery sells its products, it credits Sales. When a bank earns interest on its loans, it credits Loan Interest Revenues.
When a company issues a check, it credits the asset account Cash.
When a company receives money, it debits Cash.
Every transaction will require a debit to at least one account and a credit to at least one other account.

Here are two examples to illustrate our five tips. 

A bakery records its cash sales at a local market with a debit to Cash and a credit to Sales.
A company records its $400 payment to repair its delivery van with a debit to Vehicle Repair Expense and a credit to Cash.",what
How does the accounting equation stay in balance when the monthly rent is paid?,"How a Rent Payment Affects the Accounting Equation
A company's payment of each month's rent reduces the company's asset Cash. This is recorded with a credit to Cash.
If the payment is for the current month's rent, the second account is to the temporary account Rent Expense which will be debited. The debit to Rent Expense also causes owner's equity (or stockholders' equity) to decrease. Eventually, the balances in the company's temporary accounts will actually be transferred/closed to the owner's capital account (or to a corporation's retained earnings account within stockholders' equity).
To recap the above, the monthly rent payment keeps the sole proprietor's accounting equation, Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity, in balance because it reduces the company's assets and it reduces the company's owner's equity.",what
What is the entry when merchandise has been received but not the vendor's invoice?,"If you received merchandise, but have not received the vendor's invoice by the end of the accounting period, you need to 1) debit Purchases (periodic method) or debit Inventory (perpetual method) for the cost of the goods or merchandise received, and 2) credit Accounts Payable. You also need to include the merchandise in your physical inventory.
When the vendor's invoice is received and processed, be sure to reverse (remove) the above entry.",what
Why would Prepaid Insurance have a credit balance?,"Several situations could cause a credit balance in the asset account Prepaid Insurance. For example, let's assume a company's insurance has a cost of $600 every six months. As a result, the company decides to debit Prepaid Insurance when the amount is paid semiannually. It also prepares an automatic monthly adjusting entry to debit Insurance Expense $100 and to credit Prepaid Insurance for $100. If one of the $600 payments is debited to Insurance Expense (or another account) instead of Prepaid Insurance, the monthly adjusting entries will cause the balance in the Prepaid Insurance account to become a credit balance.
Another possibility is that the company simply failed to pay the insurance company and the monthly adjusting entries caused the balance in Prepaid Insurance to become a credit balance. Whatever the cause of the credit balance in Prepaid Insurance, the account balance needs to be adjusted before issuing a balance sheet. The Prepaid Insurance account must report the true amount that is prepaid (paid but not yet expired) as of the date of the balance sheet. If nothing is prepaid then the Prepaid Insurance account must show a zero balance. If an amount is owed to the insurance company, there should be a liability account with a credit balance for the amount owed as of the balance sheet date.
Because adjusting entries involve a balance sheet account and an income statement account, it is wise to also look at the amount being reported in the income statement account Insurance Expense. You should monitor both the Insurance Expense account balance and the Prepaid Insurance account balance throughout the year. The amount paid to the insurance company that has expired needs to be reported as an expense and the amount that has not yet expired needs to be reported as the asset Prepaid Insurance.",what
A credit is not a normal balance for what accounts?,"A credit is not a normal balance for asset accounts, the purchase account under the periodic inventory system, expense accounts, and the owner's drawing account.
Exceptions to this list would be contra accounts such as Allowance for Doubtful Accounts (a contra account to the asset Accounts Receivable) and Accumulated Depreciation (a contra account to depreciable assets). In other words, credit balances are expected for contra asset accounts. Purchase Discounts and Purchase Returns and Allowances (which are contra accounts to Purchases) are expected to have credit balances.
A general rule is that asset accounts will normally have debit balances. Liability and stockholders' equity accounts will normally have credit balances. Revenue accounts will have credit balances (since revenues will increase stockholders' or owner's equity). Expense accounts will normally have debit balances as they cause stockholders' and owner's equity to decrease.",what
Will every transaction affect an income statement account and a balance sheet account?,"No. Some transactions affect only balance sheet accounts. For example, when a company pays a supplier for goods previously purchased with terms of net 30 days, the payment will be recorded as a debit to the liability account  Accounts Payable  and as a credit to the asset account Cash. (No revenue account or expense account is involved.)
Another example of a transaction affecting two balance sheet accounts and no income statement account is a deposit for future services. The payer will debit the asset Prepaid Expenses and will credit the asset Cash. The company receiving the payment will debit Cash and will credit a liability account such as Customer Deposits, Unearned Revenues or Deferred Revenues.
Adjusting entries are a classification of accounting entries that will affect a balance sheet account and an income statement account.",what
Why are sales a credit?,"The account Sales is credited because a corporation's sales of products will cause its stockholders' equity to increase. A sole proprietorship's sales will cause the owner's equity to increase.
The Sales account is used in order to keep a tally of the sales made during an accounting year. However, when the accounting year is completed, the credit balance will be moved via closing entries to the corporation's Retained Earnings account or to the sole proprietorship's Owner's Capital account.
Recall that asset accounts will likely have debit balances and the liability and stockholders' equity accounts will likely have credit balances. To confirm that crediting the Sales account is logical, think of a cash sale. The asset account Cash is debited and therefore the Sales account will have to be credited. Also the accounting equation will remain in balance because the asset Cash is increased with a debit, and through the closing entries an owner's or stockholders' equity account will be increased with a credit.",what
What does double entry mean?,"Double entry means that every transaction will involve at least two accounts. For example, if your company borrows money from the bank, the company's asset Cash is increased and the company's liability Notes Payable is increased. If your company pays the six-month insurance premium, your company's asset Cash is decreased and its asset Prepaid Insurance is increased. If an employee works for hourly wages, the company's account Wages Expense is increased and its liability account Wages Payable is increased. When the employee is paid, the account Wages Payable is decreased and Cash is decreased.
Double entry also requires that one account be debited and the other account be credited. Accounting software might record the effect on one account automatically and only require information on the other account. For example, if you are preparing a check, the software will automatically reduce the Cash account. Therefore, the accounting software needs only to prompt you for information on the other account involved in the payment being processed.",what
Why is the accuracy of inventory valuation so important?,"Having an accurate valuation of inventory is important because the reported amount of inventory will affect 1) the cost of goods sold, gross profit, and net income on the income statement, and 2) the amount of current assets, working capital, total assets, and stockholders' or owner's equity reported on the balance sheet. In fact, an incorrect inventory valuation will cause two income statements to be incorrect. The reason is the ending inventory of one accounting period will automatically become the beginning inventory in the subsequent accounting period.",what
What is the bookkeeping equation?,"The bookkeeping equation for a sole proprietorship is assets = liabilities + owner's equity. The bookkeeping equation for a corporation is assets = liabilities + stockholders' equity. The bookkeeping equation is also referred to as the accounting equation.
In the bookkeeping equation:

assets are the resources owned by the business
liabilities are the amounts the business owes
owner's equity is the amount the owner invested plus the net income of the business minus the amounts the owner withdrew for personal use (all since the business began)

Often it is said that the liabilities and owner's equity are the claims against the assets. It can also be said that the liabilities and the owner's equity are the sources of the assets.
The bookkeeping equation should always be in balance because of double-entry bookkeeping.
To learn more about the bookkeeping or accounting equation, see our Explanation, Quiz, and more.",what
"Is contributed capital a noncurrent asset or a current asset, and is it a debit or credit?","The account Contributed Capital is part of stockholders' equity and it will have a credit balance. Contributed capital is also referred to as paid-in capital.
When a corporation issues shares of its stock for cash, the corporation's current asset Cash will increase with the debit part of the entry, and the account Contributed Capital will increase with the credit part of the entry. If the corporation then uses some of its cash to purchase equipment, its current asset Cash will decrease and its noncurrent asset Equipment will increase.
If a corporation receives equipment in exchange for newly issued shares of stock, the noncurrent asset Equipment will increase and Contributed Capital will increase.",what
What are the stockholders' equity accounts?,"The stockholders' equity accounts are balance sheet accounts and a part of the accounting equation Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders' Equity. In this light you can view the stockholders' equity accounts (along with the liability accounts) as sources of the amounts reported in the asset accounts.
If the source of an asset was an investor purchasing new shares of common stock, the corporation would credit the stockholders' equity account Common Stock and perhaps Paid-in Capital in Excess of Par—Common Stock, or Premium on Common Stock. If the source of an asset was an investor purchasing new shares of preferred stock, the corporation would credit the stockholders' equity account Preferred Stock and perhaps Paid-in Capital in Excess of Par—Preferred Stock, or Premium on Preferred Stock.
If the source of an asset was the net income earned by the corporation, the stockholders' equity account Retained Earnings would be credited. If a corporation reduces its assets by purchasing its stock from its stockholders, the contra-stockholders' equity account Treasury Stock is debited.",what
When will a transaction affect only one side of the accounting equation?,"Only one side of the accounting equation will be affected when one asset is used to acquire another asset or to replace another asset, when one liability replaces another liability, when stock is issued to replace a liability, when a cash dividend or stock dividend is declared. There are many other situations as well.
Here are some specific examples when only the left side of the accounting equation is affected. 1) A customer cannot pay an amount it owes and provides the company with a notes receivable. The company's asset Accounts Receivable will decrease and its asset Notes Receivable will increase. 2) A company prepays its insurance. As a result its asset Cash decreases and its asset Prepaid Insurance increases. 3) A company buys equipment for cash. The asset Cash decreases and the asset Equipment increases.
Here are some transactions that will affect only the right side of the accounting equation. 1) A company refinances its short-term debt with long-term debt. Short-term liabilities will decrease and long-term liabilities will increase. 2) A corporation issues common stock to replace its convertible bonds. The result is that liabilities decrease and stockholders' equity increases. 3) A corporation declares a cash dividend. A current liability Dividends Payable is created and the Retained Earnings (part of stockholders' equity) will decrease. 4) A stock dividend is declared. The paid-in capital section of stockholders' equity will increase and the retained earnings section will decrease.",what
Why does a company's profit appear as a credit on its balance sheet?,"The accounting equation and the double entry system provide an explanation why a company's profit appears as a credit on its balance sheet.
Asset accounts usually have debit balances while liabilities and owner's or stockholders' equity usually have credit balances. When a company provides services for cash, its asset Cash is increased by a debit and its owner's equity is increased by a credit. The credit is initially recorded in a revenue account, but revenue accounts are temporary accounts that cause owner's equity to increase.
If the owner withdraws some cash for personal use, the asset Cash will decrease through a credit and the owner's equity will decrease through the debit part of the accounting entry. The debit might initially be recorded in the sole proprietor's Drawing account but this account is also a temporary account that will cause the owner's equity to decrease.
Generally speaking, the credit balance reported in the owner's or stockholders' equity section of the balance sheet reflects the owners' investments in the company plus the profits earned minus the amounts distributed to the owners since the time that the company began.",what
What is the transaction approach and balance sheet approach to measuring net income?,"The transaction approach to measuring net income is the traditional bookkeeping and accounting method. That is, individual transactions such as each sale, each purchase, and every expense are recorded into general ledger accounts. At any point you can go to an account such as Salaries Expense for Sales Staff and see the year to date amount of such an expense. With the use of accounting software, an enormous quantity of transactions can be recorded into many detailed accounts.
I believe that the balance sheet approach is also referred to as the capital maintenance approach. Under the balance sheet approach one looks at the change in stockholders' or owner's equity to determine the amount of net income during the period between balance sheets. This approach requires that you exclude any additional capital from the owners as well as any dividends or withdrawals distributed to the owners. For example, if stockholders' equity increased by $5 million with $2 million caused by the issuance of new shares of stock, and $1 million distributed as dividends, the net income would have been $4 million. We can verify the calculation with the following:  net income of $4 (an addition to equity) plus new investor money of $2 (an addition to equity) = $6 of additions to equity, minus dividends of  $1 (a decrease to equity) = $5 (the net increase to equity). Under this balance sheet approach you will not have the detailed information on revenues and expenses that would be available under the transaction approach.",what
Are liabilities always a bad thing?,"Liabilities are obligations and are usually defined as a claim on assets. However, liabilities and stockholders' equity are also the sources of assets. Generally, liabilities are considered to have a lower cost than stockholders' equity. On the other hand, too many liabilities result in additional risk.
Some liabilities have low interest rates and some have no interest associated with them. For example, some of a company's accounts payable may allow payment in 30 days. With those payables it is better to have the liability and to keep your cash in the bank until they become due.
In our personal lives, our first house was probably purchased with a down payment and mortgage loan. That mortgage loan was a big liability, but it allowed us to upgrade our living space. I viewed my mortgage loan liability as a good thing because it allowed me to own a nice home in a beautiful neighborhood.
So some liabilities are good—especially the ones that have a very low interest rate. Too many liabilities could cause financial hardships.",what
"In bookkeeping, why are revenues credits?","In bookkeeping, revenues are credits because revenues cause owner's equity or stockholders' equity to increase.
Recall that the accounting equation, Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity, must always be in balance. The asset accounts are expected to have debit balances, while the liability and owner's equity accounts are expected to have credit balances. Therefore, when a company earns revenues, it will debit an asset account (such as Accounts Receivable) and will need to credit another account such as Service Revenues. The credit balance in Service Revenues will eventually be moved to the sole proprietor's capital account or to a corporation's Retained Earnings account (thereby increasing the credit balance in one of those owner's or stockholders' equity accounts).",what
Should an owner's compensation be recorded as an expense or in the Drawing account?,"If the enterprise is a sole proprietorship, the owner's compensation should be debited to the Drawing account.
If the enterprise is a corporation, the owner's gross compensation should be debited to a salary expense account.",what
"If an accrual adjusting entry increases an expense and a liability, how does the balance sheet remain in balance?",An expense is a temporary account which reduces owner's equity or stockholders' equity. The decrease in owner's equity will offset the increase in the liability account.,what
What is the accrual basis of accounting?,"Definition of Accrual Basis of Accounting
Under the accrual basis of accounting (or accrual method of accounting), revenues are reported on the income statement when they are earned. When the revenues are earned but cash is not received, the asset accounts receivable will be recorded. (Under the cash basis of accounting, revenues are not reported on the income statement until the cash is received.)
Also under the accrual basis of accounting, expenses are reported on the income statement when they match up with the revenues being reported, or when a cost has no future benefit that can be measured. When an expense occurs and cash has not yet been paid, a liability account will also be recorded. (The expenses that were not paid in the current accounting period will be reported through adjusting entries.)
In other words, under the accrual basis of accounting, the receipt of cash and the payment of cash are not the focus of reporting revenues and expenses. Rather the focus is: 1) what revenues were earned, and 2) what expenses were incurred. Therefore, the accrual basis of accounting provides a more accurate measure of a company's profitability during an accounting period, and a more accurate picture of a company's assets and liabilities at the end of an accounting period.
Example of Reporting Revenues Under the Accrual Basis of Accounting
Let's assume that I begin an accounting business in December and during December I provided $10,000 of accounting services. Since I allow clients to pay in 30 days, none of the $10,000 of fees that I earned in December were received in December. Rather, my clients paid the $10,000 in January. Under the accrual basis of accounting my business will report the $10,000 of revenues I earned on the December income statement and will report accounts receivable of $10,000 on the December 31 balance sheet.
Example of Reporting Expenses Under the Accrual Basis of Accounting
Now let's assume that I paid office rent of $1,500 and incurred $300 of costs for electricity, gas, and sewer/water during December. However, the utilities will not read the meters until January 1, will bill me on January 10 and require that I pay the bill by February 1. Under the accrual basis of accounting I will report the rent expense in December because the rent was used up in December, and I will also report estimated utilities expense of $300 so that the December income statement provides a better measure of December's profitability. Also the December 31 balance sheet will report a liability such as utilities payable of $300 to communicate a more accurate measure of obligations at December 31.
Comparing Accrual Basis to Cash Basis
Using the transactions above, the accrual basis of accounting will result in the December income statement reporting revenues of $10,000 and expenses of $1,800 for a net income of $8,200.
Using the cash basis of accounting the December income statement will report $0 revenues and expenses of $1,500 for a net loss of $8,500 even though I had earned $10,000 in accounting fees. Further, the balance sheet will not report the obligation for the utilities that were used. The January income statement will report the collection of the fees earned in December, and the February income statement will report the expense of using the December utilities. Hence, the cash basis of accounting can be misleading to the readers of the financial statements.
For financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the accrual basis of accounting is required because of the matching principle.",what
What are accruals?,"Definition of Accruals
The accounting and bookkeeping term accruals refers to adjustments that must be made before a company's financial statements are issued. Accruals involve the following types of business transactions:

expenses, losses, and liabilities that have been incurred but are not yet recorded in the accounts, and
revenues and assets that have been earned but are not yet recorded in the accounts

Example of an Accrual of an Expense
One example of an accrual of an expense and liability is a major repair that occurs in the final month of the accounting year, but is not paid until the bill is received in the first month of the following year. For the current year's financial statements to be complete (under the accrual method of accounting) the following is necessary:

the income statement for the current year must report the repair expense, and
the balance sheet as of the last day of the year must report the related liability

To record this accrual, an adjusting entry is made that debits Repairs Expense and credits Accrued Expenses Payable. 
Example of an Accrual of Revenues
One example of an accrual of revenues occurs at your electric utility company. For instance, during December the utility likely uses natural gas and/or coal plus many employees to generate the electricity used by its customers in December. However, the utility does not bill its customers for that electricity until after it reads the meters in January. As a result, the utility's financial statements will need an accrual adjustment so that:

its income statement for the month of December and for the current year will report all of the revenues earned by the utility, and
its December 31 balance sheet will report a current asset for the amount it has a right to receive from its customers (including the amount for the electricity it provided in December)

The accrual adjustment will debit the current asset account Accrued Receivables and will credit the income statement account Accrued Electricity Revenues.",what
What is the cost of goods sold?,"Definition of Cost of Goods Sold
The cost of goods sold is the cost of the products that a retailer, distributor, or manufacturer has sold.
The cost of goods sold is reported on the income statement and should be viewed as an expense of the accounting period. In essence, the cost of goods sold is being matched with the revenues from the goods sold, thereby achieving the matching principle of accounting.
When the cost of goods sold is subtracted from net sales, the result is the company's gross profit.
Examples of Calculating the Cost of Goods Sold
One way to calculate a retailer's cost of goods sold is to begin with the cost of the goods it had purchased during the accounting period and then adjust it for the change in inventory. For example, if 1,000 units of a company's only product were purchased but its inventory increased by 100 units, then the cost of 900 units will be the cost of goods sold. If 1,000 units of the product were purchased but the inventory decreased by 100 units then the cost of 1,100 units will be the cost of goods sold.
Using dollar amounts, let's assume that a retailer's cost of its merchandise purchases for a year was $300,000 while the cost of its inventory increased from $100,000 to $120,000. The result is that its cost of goods sold is $280,000 (purchases of $300,000 minus the $20,000 increase in inventory).
A second way to calculate the cost of goods sold is: the cost of the beginning inventory + the cost of goods purchased = cost of goods available - cost of ending inventory. Using the amounts above, we have $100,000 + $300,000 = $400,000 - $120,000 = $280,000.
If the cost of the ending inventory were $65,000, the cost of goods sold would have been $335,000 (purchases of $300,000 + the $35,000 decrease in inventory). 
Cost Flow Assumption Is Needed
When costs change during the accounting period, a cost flow will have to be assumed. Some common cost flow assumptions include FIFO, LIFO, and average.",what
What is owner's equity?,"Definition of Owner's Equity
Owner's equity is one of the three main sections of a sole proprietorship's balance sheet and one of the components of the accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity. 
Owner's equity represents the owner's investment in the business minus the owner's draws or withdrawals from the business plus the net income (or minus the net loss) since the business began.
Owner's equity is viewed as a residual claim on the business assets because liabilities have a higher claim. Owner's equity can also be viewed (along with liabilities) as a source of the business assets.
Example of Owner's Equity
If a sole proprietorship's accounting records indicate assets of $100,000 and liabilities of $70,000, the amount of owner's equity is $30,000.
Due to the cost principle (and other accounting principles) the amount of owner's equity should not be considered to be the fair market value of the business.",what
What is a capital expenditure versus a revenue expenditure?,"Definition of Capital Expenditure
A capital expenditure is an amount spent to acquire or significantly improve the capacity or capabilities of a long-term asset such as equipment or buildings. Usually the cost is recorded in a balance sheet account that is reported under the heading of Property, Plant and Equipment. The asset's cost (except for the cost of land) will then be allocated to depreciation expense over the useful life of the asset. The amount of each period's depreciation expense is also credited to the contra-asset account Accumulated Depreciation.
Examples of Capital Expenditures
Examples of capital expenditures include the amounts spent to acquire or significantly improve assets such as land, buildings, equipment, furnishings, fixtures, vehicles. The total amount spent on capital expenditures during an accounting year is reported under investment activities on the statement of cash flows.
Definition of Revenue Expenditure
A revenue expenditure is an amount that is spent for an expense that will be matched immediately with the revenues reported on the current period's income statement.
Examples of Revenue Expenditures
Examples of revenue expenditures include the amounts spent on repairs and maintenance, selling, general and administrative expenses.",what
What is the difference between the cash basis and the accrual basis of accounting?,"Definition of the Cash Basis of Accounting

Revenues are reported on the income statement in the period in which the cash is received from customers.
Expenses are reported on the income statement when the cash is paid out.

Definition of the Accrual Basis of Accounting
The accrual basis of accounting provides a better picture of a company's profits during an accounting period for the following reasons:

Revenues are reported on the income statement when they are earned, which often occurs before the cash is received from the customers.
Expenses are reported on the income statement in the period when they match up with the related revenues, occur, or expire, which is often in a period different from the period when the payment is made.

The accrual basis of accounting also provides a better picture of a company's financial position at the end of the accounting year. The reason is that all assets that were earned are reported and all liabilities that were incurred will be reported on the balance sheet.
The accrual basis of accounting is required because of the matching principle.",what
What is the double declining balance method of depreciation?,"Definition of Double Declining Balance Method of Depreciation
The double declining balance method of depreciation, also known as the 200% declining balance method of depreciation, is a form of accelerated depreciation. This means that compared to the straight-line method, the depreciation expense will be faster in the early years of the asset's life but slower in the later years. However, the total amount of depreciation expense during the life of the assets will be the same. 
The ""double"" means 200% of the straight line rate of depreciation, while the ""declining balance"" refers to the asset's book value or carrying value at the beginning of the accounting period. Since book value is an asset's cost minus its accumulated depreciation, the asset's book value will be decreasing when the contra asset account Accumulated Depreciation is credited with the depreciation expense of the accounting period.
Example of Double Declining Balance Depreciation
Let's assume that a retailer purchases fixtures on January 1 at a cost of $100,000. It is expected that the fixtures will have no salvage value at the end of their useful life of 10 years. Under the straight-line method, the 10-year life means the asset's annual depreciation will be 10% of the asset's cost. Under the double declining balance method the 10% straight line rate is doubled to 20%. However, the 20% is multiplied times the fixture's book value at the beginning of the year instead of the fixture's original cost.
At the beginning of the first year, the fixture's book value is $100,000 since the fixtures have not yet had any depreciation. Therefore, under the double declining balance method the $100,000 of book value will be multiplied by 20% and will result in $20,000 of depreciation for Year 1. The journal entry will be a debit of $20,000 to Depreciation Expense and a credit of $20,000 to Accumulated Depreciation.
At the beginning of the second year, the fixture's book value will be $80,000, which is the cost of $100,000 minus the accumulated depreciation of $20,000. When the $80,000 is multiplied by 20% the result is $16,000 of depreciation for Year 2.
At the beginning of Year 3, the asset's book value will be $64,000. This is the fixture's cost of $100,000 minus its accumulated depreciation of $36,000 ($20,000 + $16,000). The book value of $64,000 multiplied by 20% is $12,800 of depreciation expense for Year 3.
At the beginning of Year 4, the asset's book value will be $51,200. Therefore, the book value of $51,200 multiplied by 20% will result in $10,240 of depreciation expense for Year 4.
At the beginning of Year 5, the asset's book value will be $40,960. This is the amount to be depreciated over the remaining 6 years. In year 5, companies often switch to straight-line depreciation and debit Depreciation Expense and credit Accumulated Depreciation for $6,827 ($40,960/6 years) in each of the six remaining years.",what
What is the matching principle?,"Definition of Matching Principle
The matching principle is one of the basic underlying guidelines in accounting. The matching principle directs a company to report an expense on its income statement in the period in which the related revenues are earned. Further, it results in a liability to appear on the balance sheet for the end of the accounting period. The matching principle is associated with the accrual basis of accounting and adjusting entries.
If an expense is not directly tied to revenues, the expense should be reported on the income statement in the accounting period in which it expires or is used up. If the future benefit of a cost cannot be determined, it should be charged to expense immediately.
Examples of the Matching Principle
To illustrate the matching principle, let's assume that a company's sales are made entirely through sales representatives (reps) who earn a 10% commission. The commissions are paid on the 15th day of the month following the calendar month of the sales. For instance, if the company has $60,000 of sales in December, the company will pay commissions of $6,000 on January 15.
The matching principle requires that $6,000 of commissions expense be reported on the December income statement along with the related December sales of $60,000. It also requires that the December 31 balance sheet report a current liability of $6,000. This is referred to as an accrual and is achieved through an adjusting entry dated December 31 that debits Commissions Expense for $6,000 and credits Commissions Payable for $6,000. (Without the matching principle and the adjusting entry, the company might report the $6,000 of commissions expense in January rather than in December when the expense and the liability were incurred.)
A retailer's or a manufacturer's cost of goods sold is another example of an expense that is matched with sales through a cause and effect relationship.
Not all costs and expenses have a cause and effect relationship with revenues. Hence, the matching principle may require a systematic allocation of a cost to the accounting periods in which the cost is used up. Hence, if a company purchases an elaborate office system for $252,000 that will be useful for 84 months, the company should report $3,000 of depreciation expense on each of its monthly income statements.
If the future benefit of a cost cannot be determined, it should be charged to expense immediately. For example, the entire cost of a television advertisement that is shown during the Olympics will be charged to advertising expense in the year that the ad is shown.",what
What is a contingent liability?,"Definition of Contingent Liability
A contingent liability is a potential liability that may or may not become an actual liability. Whether the contingent liability becomes an actual liability depends on a future event occurring or not occurring.
In accounting, some contingent liabilities and their related contingent losses are:

Recorded with a journal entry
Are limited to a disclosure in the notes to the financial statements
Not recorded or disclosed

We have another Q&A that discusses the recording of contingent liabilities.
Examples of Contingent Liability
A company's supplier is unable to obtain a bank loan. The company agrees to guarantee that the supplier's bank loan will be repaid. As a result of the company's guarantee, the bank makes the loan to the supplier. The company has a contingent liability. If the supplier makes the loan payments needed to pay off the loan, the company will have no liability. If the supplier fails to repay the bank, the company will have an actual liability.
If a company is sued by a former employee for $500,000 for age discrimination, the company has a contingent liability. If the company is found guilty, it will have an actual liability. However, if the company is not found guilty, the company will not have any liability.
A product warranty is also a contingent liability.",what
What are accrued expenses and when are they recorded?,"Accrued Expenses
Accrued expenses are expenses that have occurred but are not yet recorded in the company's general ledger. This means these expenses will not appear on the financial statements unless an adjusting entry is entered prior to issuing the financial statements.
Example of an Accrued Expense
To illustrate an accrued expense, let's assume that a company borrowed $200,000 on December 1. The agreement requires that the company repay the $200,000 on February 28 along with $6,000 of interest for the three months of December through February. As of December 31, the company will not have an invoice to process and will not be paying the interest until it is due on February 28.
Recording an Accrued Expense
Without an adjusting entry to accrue the interest expense that was incurred by the company in December, the company's financial statements as of December 31 will not be reporting the $2,000 of interest (one-third of the $6,000) that the company has incurred in December. In order for the financial statements to be correct on the accrual basis of accounting, the accountant must record an adjusting entry dated as of December 31. The adjusting entry will consist of a debit of $2,000 to Interest Expense (an income statement account) and a credit of $2,000 to Interest Payable (a balance sheet account).

What is principles of accounting?,"Three meanings come to mind when you ask about principles of accounting...

Principles of accounting was often the title of the introductory course in accounting. It was also common for the textbook used in the course to be entitled Principles of Accounting.
Principles of accounting can also refer to the basic or fundamental principles of accounting: cost principle, matching principle, full disclosure principle, revenue recognition principle, going concern assumption, economic entity assumption, and so on. In this context, principles of accounting refers to the broad underlying concepts which guide accountants when preparing financial statements.
Principles of accounting can also mean generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In this context, principles of accounting includes both the underlying basic accounting principles and the official accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). These official pronouncements are the detailed rules or standards for specific topics.",what
What are prepaid expenses?,"Definition of Prepaid Expenses
Prepaid expenses are future expenses that have been paid in advance. In other words, prepaid expenses are costs that have been paid but are not yet used up or have not yet expired.
Generally, the amount of prepaid expenses that will be used up within one year are reported on a company's balance sheet as a current asset. As the amount expires, the current asset is reduced and the amount of the reduction is reported as an expense on the income statement.
Example of Prepaid Expenses
A common prepaid expense is the six-month insurance premium that is paid in advance for insurance coverage on a company's vehicles. The amount paid is often recorded in the current asset account Prepaid Insurance. If the company issues monthly financial statements, its income statement will report Insurance Expense which is one-sixth of the six-month premium. The balance in the account Prepaid Insurance will be the amount that is still prepaid as of the date of the balance sheet.",what
What is the difference between financial accounting and management accounting?,"Definition of Financial Accounting
Financial accounting has its focus on the financial statements which are distributed to stockholders, lenders, financial analysts, and others outside of a corporation or other organization. Because of the many users, the financial statements must comply with the generally accepted accounting principles, known as GAAP or US GAAP.
Definition of Managerial Accounting
Managerial accounting is focused on assisting management in the operation of the company. This will include analyzing a company's costs, assisting in financial decisions, profit planning, calculating break-even points, capital budgeting, and calculating the costs of existing products in order to value the company's inventory and to determine the cost of goods sold (both to be used on the financial statements).",what
What is the difference between product costs and period costs?,"A manufacturer's product costs are the direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead used in making its products. (Manufacturing overhead is also referred to as factory overhead, indirect manufacturing costs, and burden.) The product costs of direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead are also ""inventoriable"" costs, since these are the necessary costs of manufacturing the products.
Period costs are not a necessary part of the manufacturing process. As a result, period costs cannot be assigned to the products or to the cost of inventory. The period costs are usually associated with the selling function of the business or its general administration. The period costs are reported as expenses in the accounting period in which they 1) best match with revenues, 2) when they expire, or 3) in the current accounting period. In addition to the selling and general administrative expenses, most interest expense is a period expense.",what
What is absorption costing?,"Definition of Absorption Costing
Absorption costing (or full absorption costing) indicates that all of the manufacturing costs have been assigned to (or absorbed by) the units produced. In other words, the cost of a finished product will include the costs of:

direct materials
direct labor
variable manufacturing overhead
fixed manufacturing overhead

Absorption costing is required for external financial reporting and for income tax reporting.
Another method of costing (known a direct costing or variable costing) does not assign the fixed manufacturing overhead costs to products.

What is the difference between an implicit cost and an explicit cost?,"Definition of Implicit Cost
An implicit cost is present but it is not initially shown or reported as a separate cost. 
Definition of Explicit Cost
An explicit cost is a cost that is present and it is clearly shown or reported as a separate cost. 
Examples of Implicit Costs and Explicit Costs
Let's assume that a company gives a promissory note for $10,000 to a seller of a unique used machine for which the fair value is unknown. The promissory note will come due in three years and it does not specify any interest. Due to the company's weak financial position it would normally have to pay a high interest rate if it were able to borrow money. In this example, the promissory note does not show an explicit interest cost. However, due to the issuer's weak financial position and the seller having to wait three years to collect the money, there has to be some interest cost. In other words, there is some interest cost, but it is implicit. (To record the interest cost, accountants will discount the $10,000 by the approximate interest rate that the maker of the note would normally have to pay.)
If another company with the same financial condition purchased this unique machine by issuing a $7,120 note with a stated interest rate of 12% per year (and the rate is a fair interest rate for the situation), the compounded interest cost of $2,880 is explicit.
Another example of an implicit cost is the opportunity cost of a sole proprietor working in her own business. For example, Jane works as a sole proprietor and her business reported a net income of $30,000 for the year. Since a sole proprietor does not receive a salary or wages, there is no explicit cost reported for Jane's work in her business. However, if Jane is foregoing a salary of $40,000 from another company, this is an implicit cost. When considering this implicit cost, Jane is losing $10,000 by working in her proprietorship.
If Jane operated her business as a corporation, Jane will be an employee of the corporation and her annual salary will be an explicit cost presented as salary expense on the corporation's income statement.",what
What is the difference between stocks and bonds?,"Definition of Stocks
Stocks, or shares of capital stock, represent an ownership interest in a corporation. Every corporation has common stock. Some corporations issue preferred stock in addition to its common stock. Shares of common stock do not have maturity dates.
Stocks pay dividends, which are a distribution of the corporation's profits to its owners. However, the dividend occurs only if the corporation's board of directors declare the dividend. The dividend payments are not an expense on the corporation's financial statements or on its U.S. income tax return.
Definition of Bonds
Bonds are a form of long-term debt in which the issuing corporation promises to pay the principal amount at a specified maturity date. 
Bonds also promise to pay a fixed interest payment to the bondholders usually every six months until the bonds mature. In the U.S. the interest paid to the bondholders by the corporation is a deductible expense on the corporation's income tax return.
Typically businesses do not issue bonds.",what
Why is depreciation on the income statement different from the depreciation on the balance sheet?,"Definition of Depreciation
Depreciation is the systematic allocation of an asset's cost to expense over the useful life of the asset.
Example of Depreciation
Let's assume that a retailer purchased displays for its store at a cost of $120,000. The displays have a useful life of 10 years and will have no salvage value. The straight-line method of depreciation will result in depreciation of $1,000 per month ($120,000 divided by 120 months). The monthly journal entry to record the depreciation will be a debit of $1,000 to the income statement account Depreciation Expense and a credit of $1,000 to the balance sheet contra asset account Accumulated Depreciation.
Depreciation on the Income Statement
The depreciation reported on the income statement is the amount of depreciation expense that is appropriate for the period of time indicated in the heading of the income statement. 
Using our example, the monthly income statements will report $1,000 of depreciation expense. The quarterly income statements will report $3,000 of depreciation expense, and the annual income statements will report $12,000 of depreciation expense. Each month $1,000 of depreciation expense is being matched to the 120 monthly income statements during which the displays are used to generate sales revenues.
Depreciation on the Balance Sheet
The depreciation reported on the balance sheet is the accumulated or the cumulative total amount of depreciation that has been reported as depreciation expense on the income statement from the time the assets were acquired until the date of the balance sheet.
Using our example, after one month of use the accumulated depreciation for the displays will be $1,000. After 24 months of use, the accumulated depreciation reported on the balance sheet will be $24,000. After 120 months, the accumulated depreciation reported on the balance sheet will be $120,000. At that point, the depreciation will stop since the displays' cost of $120,000 has been fully depreciated. If the displays continue to be used in the 11th year, there will be no depreciation expense in the 11th year and the accumulated depreciation will continue to be $120,000.",what
What is the cost principle?,"Definition of Cost Principle
The cost principle is one of the basic underlying guidelines in accounting. It is also known as the historical cost principle. 
The cost principle requires that assets be recorded at the cash amount (or the equivalent) at the time that an asset is acquired. Further, the amount recorded will not be increased for inflation or improvements in market value. (An exception is the change in market value of a short-term investment in the capital stock of a corporation whose shares of stock are actively traded on a major stock exchange.)
Example of Cost Principle
The cost principle means that a long-term asset purchased for the cash amount of $50,000 will be recorded at $50,000. If the same asset was purchased for a down payment of $20,000 and a formal promise to pay $30,000 within a reasonable period of time and with a reasonable interest rate, the asset will also be recorded at $50,000.
A long-term asset that will be used in a business (other than land) will be depreciated based on its cost. The cost will be reported on the balance sheet along with the amount of the asset's accumulated depreciation. Further, the accumulated depreciation cannot exceed the asset's cost. 
The cost principle prohibits a company from recording an asset that was not acquired in a transaction. Hence, a company cannot report its highly successful management team as an asset nor can it report its highly valuable trademark that it developed over many years. (As a result of the cost principle, some of a company's most valuable assets will not appear as assets on the company's balance sheet.) On the other hand, if the company acquires a competitor's trademark in a $3 million transaction, that trademark will be reported as an asset at its cost of $3 million.",what
What is goodwill?,"Definition of Goodwill
In accounting, goodwill is an intangible asset associated with a business combination. Goodwill is recorded when a company acquires (purchases) another company and the purchase price is greater than 1) the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired, minus 2) the liabilities that were assumed.
Goodwill is reported on the balance sheet as a long-term or noncurrent asset. Since 2001, U.S. companies are no longer required to amortize the recorded amount of goodwill. However, the amount of goodwill is subject to a goodwill impairment test at least once per year. (Beginning in 2015, private companies may opt to amortize goodwill generally over a 10-year period and thereby minimize the cost and complexity involved with testing for impairment.)
Outside of accounting, goodwill might be referring to some value that has been built up within a company as a result of delivering amazing customer service, unique management, teamwork, etc. However, this goodwill is unrelated to a business combination and cannot be recorded or reported on the company's balance sheet.
Example of Goodwill
Let's assume that Company A acquires Business X for $5 million based on Business X's annual net income X 10. The fair value of Business X's identifiable assets was $4 million and its liabilities were $1 million. Therefore, Company A is paying $5 million for identifiable assets and liabilities having a value of $3 million ($4 million of assets minus $1 million of liabilities). When Company A records the transaction, it will:

Debit various asset accounts for $4 million
Credit various liability accounts for $1 million
Credit Cash for $5 million
Debit Goodwill for $2 million

The $2 million, that was over and above the fair value of the identifiable assets minus the liabilities, must have been for something else. We refer to that something else as goodwill.",what
Where does revenue received in advance go on a balance sheet?,"Definition of Revenue Received in Advance
Under the accrual basis of accounting, revenues received in advance of being earned are reported as a liability. If they will be earned within one year, they should be listed as a current liability.
When a company receives money in advance of earning it, the accounting entry is a debit to the asset Cash for the amount received and a credit to the liability account such as Customer Advances or Unearned Revenues.
As the amount received in advance is earned, the liability account should be debited for the amount earned and a revenue account should be credited. This is done through an adjusting entry.
Examples of Revenue Received in Advance
The following are a few examples of revenue received in advance:

An insurance company receiving premiums for protection during the following six months
A magazine publisher receiving money from a subscriber for magazines for the following year
A website design company receiving a client's down payment for future work
A law firm receiving a retainer fee from a new client",what
How do you calculate accrued vacation pay?,"Definition of Accrued Vacation Pay
Accrued vacation pay is the amount of vacation pay that a company's employees have earned, but the company has not yet paid.
Example of Accrued Vacation Pay
Let's assume that a company has a formal agreement that provides its employees with 120 hours of paid vacation in the year following the employees' full-time employment. Let's also assume that the company has only one full-time employee who began working at the company on January 1 of the current year and has an hourly pay rate of $26. In the current year, this employee will earn vacation pay of $3,120 (120 hours x $26), or $60 per week ($3,120 per year divided by 52 weeks). This means that in the current year the company must record vacation pay expense and a related liability at a rate of $60 per week.
In our example, the company has only the one full-time employee, so the company's December 31 balance sheet must report a current liability of $3,120.
Vacation pay is an example of an accrued expense and an accrued liability that is required by the matching principle.
Balance Sheet: Retail/Wholesale - Corporation",what
What is deferred revenue?,"Deferred Revenue
Deferred revenue is money received by a company in advance of having earned it. In other words, deferred revenues are not yet revenues and therefore cannot yet be reported on the income statement. As a result, the unearned amount must be deferred to the company's balance sheet where it will be reported as a liability.
The title of the general ledger liability account may have the title of Unearned Revenues, Deferred Revenues, or Customer Deposits. As the deferred amount is earned, it should be moved from Unearned Revenues to an income statement revenue account (such as Sales Revenues, Service Revenues, Fees Earned, etc).
Example of Deferred Revenue
To illustrate deferred revenue, let's assume that a company designs websites and has been asked to provide a price quote for a new website. The design company states that it can complete the new website for $70,000. The terms require a payment of $30,000 at the time the contract is signed and $40,000 at the end of the project, which is estimated to take 60 days. The company agrees to begin working on the project 10 days after the $30,000 is received.
Now let's assume that on December 27, the design company receives the $30,000 and it will begin the project on January 4. Therefore, on December 27, the design company will record a debit of $30,000 to Cash and a credit of $30,000 to Deferred Revenues. On December 31, its balance sheet will report a current liability of $30,000 with the description Deferred revenues.
As of January 31 the company has completed 2/7 of the work. Therefore, it will record an adjusting entry dated January 31 that will debit Deferred Revenues for $20,000 and will credit the income statement account Design Revenues for $20,000. Thus, the January 31 balance sheet will report Deferred revenues of $10,000 (the company's remaining obligation/liability from the $30,000 it received on December 27).",what
Is there a difference between an expense and an expenditure?,"Definition of Expense
An expense is reported on the income statement in the period in which the cost matches the related sales, has expired, was used up, or had no future value. 
Examples of Expenses
Examples of expenses include the cost of the goods that were sold during the current period, and the following which also occurred during the current period: salaries earned by the company's employees, interest expense incurred, commissions earned by sales representatives, rent and utilities for a retail store, and many others.
Definition of Expenditure
An expenditure is a payment or disbursement. The expenditure may be for the purchase of an asset, a reduction of a liability, a distribution to the owners, or it could be payment in the same accounting period as the amount becomes an expense.
Examples of Expenditures
Examples of expenditures that will not be an expense in the accounting period in which the payments are made include the purchase of land for a future expansion and the principal portion of a monthly loan payment.
Here is an example to illustrate the difference between an expense and an expenditure. A company makes an expenditure of $255,500 to purchase equipment. The expenditure occurs on a single day and the equipment is immediately placed in service. Assuming the equipment will be used for seven years, the asset's cost could be reported on the income statement as depreciation expense of $100 per day for the next 2,555 days (7 years of use).",what
What is depreciation?,"Definition of Depreciation
In accounting, depreciation is the assigning or allocating of the cost of a plant asset (other than land) to expense in the accounting periods that are within the asset's useful life. 
Example of Depreciation
Let's assume that a business purchases a delivery truck with a cost of $100,000 and it is expected to be used for 5 years. If we also assume that the truck will have no salvage value, the company will record depreciation expense of $100,000 over the five years. When the straight-line method of depreciation is used the annual depreciation expense will be $20,000. (The amounts can vary depending on the depreciation method and assumptions.)",what
What are adjusting entries?,"Definition of Adjusting Entries
Adjusting entries are usually made on the last day of an accounting period (year, quarter, month) so that a company's financial statements comply with the accrual method of accounting. In other words, the adjusting entries are needed so that a company's:

Income statement reports the revenues that have been earned during the accounting period
Balance sheet reports the receivables that it has a right to receive as of the end of the accounting period
Income statement reports the expenses  and losses that were incurred during the accounting period
Balance sheet reports the liabilities it has incurred as of the end of the accounting period

Examples of Adjusting Entries
Here are a few examples of the need for adjusting entries:

A company shipped goods on credit, but the company's sales invoice was not processed as of the end of the accounting period
A company received some goods from a vendor but the vendor's invoice had not been processed by the company as of the end of the accounting period
A company that prepares monthly income statements paid for 6 months of insurance coverage in the first month of the insurance coverage. (This means that 5/6 of the payment is a prepaid asset and only 1/6 of the payment should be reported as an expense on each of the monthly income statements.)
A company's customer paid in advance for services to be provided over several accounting periods. Until the services are provided, the unearned amount is reported as a liability. After the services are provided, an entry is needed to reduce the liability and to report the revenues.

Note that a common characteristic of every adjusting entry will involve at least one income statement account and at least one balance sheet account.",what
How do you record a payment for insurance?,"Definition of Payment for Insurance
A company's property insurance, liability insurance, business interruption insurance, etc. often covers a one-year period with the cost (insurance premiums) paid in advance. The one-year period for the insurance rarely coincides with the company's accounting year. Therefore, the insurance payments will likely involve more than one annual financial statement and many interim financial statements. 
Prepaid Insurance vs. Insurance Expense
When the insurance premiums are paid in advance, they are referred to as prepaid. At the end of any accounting period, the amount of the insurance premiums that remain prepaid should be reported in the current asset account, Prepaid Insurance. The prepaid amount will be reported on the balance sheet after inventory and could part of an item described as prepaid expenses.
As the prepaid amount expires, the balance in Prepaid Insurance is reduced by a credit to Prepaid Insurance and a debit to Insurance Expense. This is done with an adjusting entry at the end of each accounting period (e.g. monthly). One objective of the adjusting entry is to match the proper amount of insurance expense to the period indicated on the income statement.
Example of Payment for Insurance Expense
Let's assume that a company is started on December 1 and arranges for business insurance to begin on December 1. On December 1 the company pays the insurance company $12,000 for the insurance premiums covering one year. The company will record the payment with a debit of $12,000 to Prepaid Insurance and a credit of $12,000 to Cash.
On December 31, the company writes an adjusting entry to record the insurance expense that was used up (expired) and to reduce the amount that remains prepaid. This is accomplished with a debit of $1,000 to Insurance Expense and a credit of $1,000 to Prepaid Insurance. This same adjusting entry will be prepared at the end of each of the next 11 months.",what
What is GAAP?,"Definition of GAAP
GAAP is the acronym for generally accepted accounting principles. GAAP consists of the following:

Basic underlying accounting principles, assumptions, and concepts such as the cost principle, matching principle, full disclosure principle, and more.
Detailed reporting standards and other rules established and organized by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in its Accounting Standards Codification (FASB ASC)
Generally accepted industry practices

Examples of the Basic Underlying Accounting Principles
The basic underlying accounting principles are:

Economic Entity Assumption
Going Concern Assumption
Time Period Assumption
Monetary Unit Assumption
Cost Principle (or Measurement Principle)
Matching Principle (or Expense Recognition Principle)
Revenue Recognition Principle
Full Disclosure Principle
Industry Practices

In addition to the basic underlying accounting principles, there are various characteristics that also guide accountants. Some of the characteristics include objectivity, conservatism, materiality, cost/benefit, comparability, relevance, and timeliness.
Why GAAP is Important
In order for investors, bankers, financial analysts, portfolio managers, etc. to make informed decisions, it is necessary to have financial statements that are consistent and which can be compared to the financial statements of other corporations. This is more likely to occur when there are common rules for financial reporting. When financial statements are distributed by a business or other organization, the common rules that must be followed are known as generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP.",what
What is bad debts expense?,"Definition of Bad Debts Expense
Bad debts expense is related to a company's current asset accounts receivable. Bad debts expense is also referred to as uncollectible accounts expense or doubtful accounts expense. Bad debts expense results because a company delivered goods or services on credit and the customer did not pay the amount owed.
Examples of Bad Debts Expense
There are two methods for reporting the amount of bad debts expense:

direct write-off method
allowance method

The direct write-off method requires that a customer's uncollectible account be removed from Accounts Receivable and at that time the following entry is made: debit Bad Debts Expense and credit Accounts Receivable.
The allowance method  anticipates and estimates that some of the accounts receivable will not be collected. In other words, prior to knowing exactly which customers or clients will not be paying, the company will debit Bad Debts Expense and will credit Allowance for Doubtful Accounts for the estimated amount. (The Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is a contra asset account that when presented along with Accounts Receivable indicates a more realistic amount that will be turning to cash.)
For financial statement purposes the allowance method is the better method since 1) the balance sheet will be reporting a more realistic amount that will be collected from the company's accounts receivable, and 2) the bad debts expense will be reported on the income statement closer to the time of the related credit sales. However, for income tax purposes the direct write-off method must be used.",what
Is income tax an expense or liability?,"Definition of Income Tax
In the accounting for a regular U.S. corporation, income tax usually refers to the federal, state, local, and foreign countries' taxes that are levied based on a corporation's taxable income. The taxable income and the related income tax are found on the corporation's income tax return. (The corporation's taxable income is based on the income tax laws and regulations of the various governments.)
The accounting and financial reporting of a regular corporation's income taxes is complicated because the accounting principles are likely to be different from the income tax laws and regulations. Generally, a profitable regular corporation's financial statements will report both income tax expense and a current liability such as income taxes payable.
Examples of Income Tax Expense and Income Taxes Payable
A profitable corporation's financial statements will report:

Income tax expense on its income statement for the revenues and expenses appearing on the accounting period's income statement, and
Income taxes payable (a current liability on the balance sheet) for the amount of income taxes owed to the various governments as of the date of the balance sheet

If a corporation has overpaid its income taxes and is entitled to a refund, the amount will be reported on the balance sheet as a current asset such as Other receivables.
If there are differences between the time when certain revenues and expenses are reported on the income tax returns versus when they are reported on the financial statements, the amount of the deferred income tax will likely be reported on the balance sheet as a noncurrent liability as Deferred income taxes.",what

Operating expenses are the costs that have been used up (expired) as part of a company's main operating activities during the period shown in the heading of its income statement.
Examples of Operating Activities
Examples of a retailer's main operating activities involve the buying and selling of merchandise or goods. Therefore, the retailer's income statement will report the following operating expenses:

Cost of goods sold. These costs are reported as operating expenses on the income statement because of the matching principle: The cost of the merchandise that is sold is being matched with the revenues from selling the goods.
Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A). These costs are reported as operating expenses on the income statement because they pertain to operating the main business during that accounting period. These costs are expenses because they may have expired, may have been used up, or may not have a future value that can be measured.

Some authors define operating expenses as only SG&A. In other words, they do not include the cost of goods sold as an operating expense. Such a definition will be deficient when measuring a company's operating income. Clearly, the calculation of operating income cannot omit the cost of goods sold.",what
What should be the entry when goods are purchased at a discount?,"Definition of Goods Purchased at a Discount
There are two common types of discounts for companies buying goods to resell:

Trade discount
Early payment discount

Examples of Entries for Goods Purchased at a Discount
Trade discount. Some suppliers have catalogs with prices before any discounts. Let's assume that the supplier gives companies that purchase a high volume of goods a trade discount of 30%. A small volume buyer receives only a 10% discount. If a high volume company purchases $40,000 of goods, its cost will be $28,000 ($40,000 X 70%). To comply with the cost principle the company will debit Purchases (or Inventory) for $28,000 and will credit Accounts Payable for $28,000.
Early payment discount. Some suppliers offer discounts of 1% or 2% from the sales invoice amount, if the invoice is paid in 10 days instead of the usual 30 days. For instance, let's assume that a company purchases goods and the supplier's sales invoice is $28,000 with terms of 1/10, net 30. This means that the company can deduct $280 (1% of $28,000) if it pays the invoice within 10 days. Otherwise, the company must pay $28,000 within 30 days. The early payment discount is also referred to as a purchase discount or cash discount.
If the company pays the supplier's invoice within 10 days, there are two ways to record the early payment discount of $280:

Gross method. At the time goods are received: debit of $28,000 to Purchases, credit of $28,000 to Accounts Payable. At the payment date within 10 days: debit of $28,000 to Accounts Payable, credit of $27,720 to Cash, credit of $280 to Purchases Discounts (a contra account to Purchases)
Net method. (This method is used less often and only if the company has the resources to always pay within the discount period.) At the time the goods are received: debit of $27,720 to Purchases, credit of $27,720 to Accounts Payable. At the payment date within 10 days: debit $27,720 to Accounts Payable, credit $27,720 to Cash. [If the company fails to pay the invoice within the discount period, the payment will be a debit of $27,720 to Accounts Payable, a debit of $280 to Purchase Discounts, a credit to Cash for $28,000. Purchase Discounts Lost is an income statement account.]",what
What is a long-term liability?,"Definition of Long-term Liability
A long-term liability is an obligation resulting from a previous event that is not due within one year of the date of the balance sheet (or not due within the company's operating cycle if it is longer than one year). Long-term liabilities are also known as noncurrent liabilities.
Examples of Long-term Liabilities
Some examples of long-term liabilities are the noncurrent portions of the following:

bonds payable
long-term loans
pension liabilities
postretirement healthcare liabilities
deferred compensation
deferred revenues
deferred income taxes
customer deposits

Some long-term debt that will be due within one year of the balance sheet date can continue to be reported as a long-term liability if there is:

a long-term investment that is sufficient and restricted for the payment of the debt, or
intent and a noncancelable arrangement that assures that the long-term debt will be replaced with new long-term debt or with capital stock.",what
How do you report a write-down in inventory?,"Definition of Write-down in Inventory
Under FIFO and average cost methods, when the net realizable value of inventory is less than the cost of the inventory, there needs to be a reduction in the inventory amount. Often the balance in the current asset account Inventory is reduced through a credit to a contra inventory account, which is referred to as a valuation account. The debit in the entry to write down inventory is recorded in an account such as Loss on Write-Down of Inventory, which is an income statement account.
Example of Reporting a Write-down in Inventory
Under FIFO and average cost methods, if the net realizable value is less than the inventory's cost, the balance sheet must report the lower amount. If the amount of the Loss on Write-Down of Inventory is relatively small, it can be reported on the income statement as part of the cost of goods sold. If the amount of the Loss on Write-Down of Inventory is significant, it should be reported as a separate line on the income statement.
Since the amount of the write-down of inventory reduces net income, it will also reduce the amount reported on the balance sheet for owner's equity or stockholders' equity. Thus, the balance sheet and the accounting equation will show a reduction in inventory and in owner's or stockholders' equity.",what
What is working capital?,"Definition of Working Capital
Working capital is the amount of a company's current assets minus the amount of its current liabilities. 
Example of Working Capital
Let's assume that a company's balance sheet dated June 30 reports the following amounts:

Total amount of current assets is $323,000
Total amount of current liabilities is $310,000

Therefore, the company's working capital on June 30 was $13,000. If one year earlier the company had current assets of $210,000 and current liabilities of $60,000, its working capital was $150,000.
Additional Comments on Working Capital
The adequacy of a company's working capital depends on the industry in which it competes, its relationship with its customers and suppliers, and other factors such as the following:

The types of current assets and how quickly they can be converted to cash. For instance, marketable securities can be converted to cash much faster than inventory.
The nature of the company's sales and how customers pay. If a company has very consistent sales via the Internet and its customers pay with credit cards at the time they place the order, a small amount of working capital may be sufficient. However, another company in an industry where the credit terms are net 60 days will need a greater amount of working capital.
Having an approved credit line with no borrowing allows a company to operate comfortably with a small amount of working capital.

In short, there is more to working capital than simply subtracting current liabilities from current assets.",what
What is an impairment?,"Definition of Impairment
The term impairment is associated with an asset currently having a market value that is less than the asset's book value . A test is done to determine whether the asset's book value should be reduced to the current market value and to report the amount of the write-down (reduction) as a loss on its income statement.
Examples of Impairment
A meat packing plant in recent years invested large amounts in its plant and equipment. Since then, the company experienced a dramatic decline in the demand for its products and in the value of its plant and equipment. If the required test of impairment indicates that a loss must be recorded on its plant and equipment, its book value must be reduced and the resulting loss reported on its income statement.
A second example is Corporation X that acquired another company. The amount paid for the company resulted in Corporation X reporting a large amount for the intangible asset goodwill. Since the acquisition, the acquired company's value has declined to only a small fraction of the amount currently reported as goodwill. A test must be done and it may require a reduction in the reported amount of goodwill and a resulting impairment loss reported on the company's income statement.",what
What is prepaid insurance?,"Definition of Prepaid Insurance
Prepaid insurance is the portion of an insurance premium that has been paid in advance and has not expired as of the date of a company's balance sheet. This unexpired cost is reported in the current asset account Prepaid Insurance.
As the amount of prepaid insurance expires, the expired portion is moved from the current asset account Prepaid Insurance to the income statement account Insurance Expense. This is usually done at the end of each accounting period through an adjusting entry.
Example of Prepaid Insurance
To illustrate prepaid insurance, let's assume that on November 20 a company pays an insurance premium of $2,400 for insurance protection during the six-month period of December 1 through May 31. On November 20, the payment is entered with a debit of $2,400 to Prepaid Insurance and a credit of $2,400 to Cash.
As of November 30 none of the $2,400 cost has expired and the entire $2,400 will be reported on the balance sheet as Prepaid Insurance or Prepaid Expenses. On December 31, an adjusting entry will debit Insurance Expense for $400 (the amount that expired: 1/6 of $2,400) and will credit Prepaid Insurance for $400. This means that the debit balance in Prepaid Insurance at December 31 will be $2,000 (5/6 of the $2,400 cost), since this is the amount that has not yet expired.
At the end of each month, an adjusting entry of $400 will be recorded to debit Insurance Expense and credit Prepaid Insurance.",what
What is the difference between accounts payable and accrued expenses payable?,"Definition of Accounts Payable
Accounts Payable is a liability account in which suppliers' or vendors' approved invoices are recorded. As a result, the balance in Accounts Payable should be a precise amount.
Definition of Accrued Expenses Payable
Accrued Expenses Payable is a liability account that records amounts that are owed, but the vendors' invoices have not yet been received and/or have not yet been recorded in Accounts Payable as of the end of the accounting period. The amounts in this account are usually recorded with accrual adjusting entries made at the end of the accounting period.
Examples of Accrued Expenses Payable
In addition to the amounts associated with vendors' invoices, accrued expenses may also include wages, interest, utilities, and other expenses that were incurred and owed, but not yet recorded in the general ledger accounts. Some of the amounts recorded in Accrued Expenses Payable may be estimated amounts that should supported by reasonable and documented calculations.

How do I compute the units of production method of depreciation?,"Definition of Units of Production Depreciation
The units of production method of depreciation (which is also referred to as the units of activity method) assumes that an asset's useful life is more related to its usage rather than the mere passage of time. Under the units of production method, depreciation during a given year will be greater when there is a higher volume of activity. In times of low usage the asset's depreciation will be less.
Example of Calculating Units of Production Depreciation
To illustrate the units of production method, let's assume that a company has a machine with a cost of $500,000 and a useful life that is expected to end after producing 240,000 units of a component part. Further, the machine's salvage value at that point is assumed to be $20,000.
Given the above assumptions, the amount to be depreciated is $480,000 ($500,000 minus $20,000). Dividing the $480,000 by the machine's useful life of 240,000 units, the depreciation will be $2 per unit. If the machine produces 10,000 units in the first year, the depreciation for the year will be $20,000 ($2 x 10,000 units). If the machine produces 50,000 units in the next year, the depreciation will be $100,000 ($2 x 50,000 units). The depreciation will be calculated similarly each year until the asset's Accumulated Depreciation reaches $480,000.
The units of production method or units of activity method could be useful for depreciating airplanes and vehicles (based on miles used), printing machines (based on pages run), DVDs (based on number of times rented), etc.",what
What is materiality?,"Definition of Materiality
In accounting, materiality refers to the relative size of an amount. Relatively large amounts are material, while relatively small amounts are not material (or immaterial). Determining materiality requires professional judgement. For instance, a $20,000 amount will likely be immaterial for a large corporation with a net income of $900,000. However, the same $20,000 amount will be material for a small corporation with a net income of $40,000.
Another view of materiality is whether sophisticated investors would be misled if the amount was omitted or misclassified. If sophisticated investors would be misled or would have made a different decision, the amount is considered to be material. If sophisticated investors would not be misled or would not have made a different decision, the amount is judged to be immaterial. 
Example of Materiality
A classic example of the materiality concept is a company expensing a $20 wastebasket in the year it is acquired instead of depreciating it over its useful life of 10 years. The matching principle directs you to record the wastebasket as an asset and then report depreciation expense of $2 a year for 10 years. Materiality allows you to expense the entire $20 cost in the year it is acquired. The reason is that no investor, creditor, or other interested party would be misled by immediately expensing the $20 wastebasket.
Materiality also justifies large corporations having a policy of immediately expensing assets having a cost of less than $2,500 instead of setting up fixed asset records and depreciating those assets over their useful lives.",what
What is the difference between cost and expense?,"Definition of Cost
A cost might be an expense or it might be an asset. 
Definition of Expense
An expense is a cost that has expired or was necessary in order to earn revenues. The matching principle guides accountants as to when a cost will be reported as an expense. 
Example of a Cost
A company's property insurance bill for the next six months of insurance shows a cost of $6,000. Initially the cost of $6,000 is reported as the current asset Prepaid Insurance (or Prepaid Expense) since the cost has not been used up (has not expired).
Example of an Expense
As a prepaid cost such as the $6,000 in the asset account Prepaid Insurance expires, the part that expires will be reported on the income statement as Insurance Expense. If the insurance cost is expiring at a rate of $1,000 per month, then each month the amount in the asset account Prepaid Insurance will decrease by $1,000 and Insurance Expense of $1,000 will be reported on the income statement.",what
What is the full disclosure principle?,"Definition of Full Disclosure Principle
The full disclosure principle requires a company to provide the necessary information so that people who are accustomed to reading financial information are able to make informed decisions regarding the company.
Examples of Full Disclosure Principle
The disclosures required under this principle can be found in a number of places, such as:

The company's financial statements including the notes to the financial statements and supplementary schedules
A publicly-traded corporation's annual report to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (Form 10-K), especially the section entitled Management's Discussion and Analysis
Quarterly earnings reports, press releases and other communications

The notes to a company's financial statements will likely begin with a description of the company's significant accounting policies such as how and when revenues are recognized, how property is depreciated, how inventory and income taxes are accounted for, and more.
Other disclosures in the notes to the financial statements include the effects of new accounting pronouncements, details regarding earnings per share, receivables, advertising, leases, related-party transactions, income taxes, stock options, contingent liabilities, and much more.",what
How do you write off a bad account?,"Definition of the Write-off of a Bad Account
The write-off of a bad account usually refers to eliminating an account receivable due to the customer's inability to pay the amount owed.
The entry to write off a bad account depends on whether the company is using the direct write-off method or the allowance method.
Examples of the Write-off of a Bad Account
Under the direct write-off method a company writes off a bad account receivable when a specific account is determined to be uncollectible. This usually occurs many months after the credit sale occurred. The entry to write off the bad account under the direct write-off method is:

Debit Bad Debts Expense (to report the amount of the loss on the company's income statement)
Credit Accounts Receivable (to remove the amount that will not be collected)

.
In the U.S., the direct write-off method is required for income tax purposes, but is not the method to be used for a company's financial statements.
Under the allowance method a company anticipates that some of its credit sales and accounts receivable will not be collected and establishes an Allowance for Doubtful Accounts prior to knowing the specific account or accounts that will become uncollectible. The Allowance account is established and adjusted with the following journal entry:

Debit Bad Debts Expense, and
Credit Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

.
When a specific customer's account is identified as uncollectible, the journal entry to write off the account is:

A credit to Accounts Receivable (to remove the amount that will not be collected)
A debit to Allowance for Doubtful Accounts (to reduce the Allowance balance that was previously established)

Note that under the allowance method the write-off did not affect an income statement account. The income statement account Bad Debts Expense was affected earlier when the Allowance balance was established or adjusted.
For financial reporting purposes the allowance method is preferred since it means the loss (bad debts expense) is recognized closer to the time of the credit sales. This also means that the balance sheet will be reporting a lower, more realistic amount of its accounts receivable sooner.",what
Where are accruals reflected on the balance sheet?,"Definition of Accruals
The accrual of expenses and liabilities refers to expenses and/or liabilities that a company has incurred, but the company has not yet paid or recorded the transaction. The accrual of an expense will usually involve an accrual adjusting entry that increases a company's expenses and increases its current liabilities.
The accrual of revenues and assets refers to revenues and/or assets that a company has earned, but the company has not yet received the money nor has it recorded the transaction. The accrual of revenues will usually involve an accrual adjusting entry that increases a company's revenues and increases its current assets.
Example of an Accrual as a Current Liability
Assume that a company has an emergency sewer repair on December 30. The plumbing contractor said the bill will be finalized and mailed to the company on January 10; however, the bill will be approximately $6,000. The company will need to accrue the expense incurred and the related current liability before the December 31 financial statements are prepared. The adjusting entry will debit Repairs Expense for $6,000, and credit Accrued Expenses Payable for $6,000.
Examples of other expenses that usually need an accrual adjusting entry resulting in a current liability include wages, utilities, bonuses, taxes, and interest.
Example of an Accrual as a Current Asset
Assume that during December a company has earned interest of $5,000 on its investment in U.S. Treasury bills. However, the interest will be received by the company on February 15. The company needs to accrue the revenue it earned and the related current asset before the December 31 financial statements are prepared. The adjusting entry will debit Interest Receivable for $5,000, and credit Investment Income for $5,000.

What is going concern?,"Definition of Going Concern
The going concern assumption is a basic underlying assumption of accounting. For a company to be a going concern, it must be able to continue operating long enough to carry out its commitments, obligations, objectives, and so on. In other words, the company will not have to liquidate or be forced out of business. If there is uncertainty as to a company's ability to meet the going concern assumption, the facts and conditions must be disclosed in its financial statements.
Additional Comments
The going concern assumption provides logic for the cost principle. If a company is a going concern (and therefore liquidation is not relevant), reporting its long term assets at cost is sufficient and there is no need to report the long term assets at their current values or liquidation values? (An exception to cost exists when a long term asset's value has been impaired.)",what
What is interest expense?,"Definition of Interest Expense
Interest expense is the cost of borrowing money during a specified period of time. Interest expense is occurring daily, but the interest is likely to be paid monthly, quarterly, semiannually, or annually.
Example of Interest Expense
Let's assume that a company uses the accrual basis of accounting. If the company borrows $100,000 on December 15 and agrees to pay interest on the 15th day of each month at the rate of 1% per month, the interest expense for the month of December will be approximately $500 ($100,000 x 1% x 1/2 month). The interest expense for the month of January will be $1,000 ($100,000 x 1%).
In this example, as of December 31 no interest has been paid on the loan that began on December 15. However, the company did incur one-half month of interest expense. Therefore, the company needs to record an accrual adjusting entry that debits Interest Expense for $500, and credits Interest Payable for $500.",what
What is a capital account?,"Definition of Capital Account
In accounting and bookkeeping, a capital account is a general ledger account that is part of the balance sheet classification:

Owner's equity (in a sole proprietorship)
Stockholders' equity (in a corporation)

Examples of Capital Accounts
The sole proprietorship of J. Lee will include the following capital accounts:

J. Lee, Capital, which is increased by J. Lee's investment into the business plus each accounting period's net income, and which is decreased by the debit balance in the account J. Lee, Drawing
J. Lee, Drawing, which is a temporary account that records the proprietor's draws during the year. At the end of the year, the account's debit balance will be closed to owner's capital account

A corporation will likely have the following capital accounts:

Paid-in capital accounts such as Common Stock, Preferred Stock, Paid-in Capital in Excess of Par, which are used to record the amounts received by the corporation when shares of its capital stock were originally issued to investors.
The account Retained Earnings which consists of the amount of the corporation's earnings since the corporation was formed minus the dividends distributed to the stockholders since the corporation was formed.
The account Treasury Stock, which has a debit balance representing the amount paid by the corporation to repurchase its own shares of stock which it did not retire.

Other Information on Capital Accounts
The total of the balances in all of the capital accounts must be equal to the reported total of the company's assets minus its liabilities. Because of the historical cost principle and other accounting principles, the total amount reported in the capital accounts will not indicate a company's market value.",what
Where is a contingent liability recorded?,"Recording a Contingent Liability
A potential or contingent liability that is both probable and the amount can be estimated is recorded as 1) an expense or loss on the income statement, and 2) a liability on the balance sheet. 
Disclosing a Contingent Liability
A loss contingency which is possible but not probable will not be recorded in the accounts as a liability and a loss. Rather, it will be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
A loss contingency that is probable or possible but the amount cannot be estimated means the amount cannot be recorded in the company's accounts or reported as liability on the balance sheet. Instead, the contingent liability will be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. 
Not Reporting or Disclosing a Contingent Liability
A loss contingency that is remote  will not be recorded and it will not have to be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. An example is a nuisance lawsuit where there is no similar case that was ever successful.
Example of Recording a Contingent Liability
Product warranties are often cited as a contingent liability that meets both of the required conditions (probable and the amount can be estimated). Product warranties will be recorded at the time of the products' sales by debiting Warranty Expense and crediting to Warranty Liability for the estimated amount.",what
What is revenue?,"Definition of Revenue
Revenue is the amount a company receives from selling goods and/or providing services to its customers and clients. A company's revenue, which is reported on the first line of its income statement, is often described as sales or service revenues. Hence, revenue is the amount earned from customers and clients before subtracting the company's expenses. 
Revenue vs Net Income
While revenue is the top line on a company's income statement, net income is often referred to as the bottom line.
The difference between the amount of revenue and the amount of net income is significant. Here are some hypothetical amounts to illustrate the point:

Revenue from sales of products $300,000
Cost of the products that were sold $200,000
Expenses (wages, rent, ads, etc.) $88,000
Net income (before tax) $12,000

Using the above amounts we see that the company's net income was only 4% of its revenue ($12,000/$300,000). 
Calculating Revenue
The best way to calculate a company's revenue during an accounting period (year, month, etc.) is to sum up the amounts earned (as opposed to the amounts of cash that were received). For example, if a new company sold $75,000 of goods in December but allows the customer to pay 30 days later, the company's December sales are $75,000 (even though no cash was received in December). Reporting revenues in the period in which they are earned is known as the accrual basis of accounting. Hence, a company's revenue could occur before the cash is received, after the cash is received, or at time that the cash is received.
(Note that for income tax reporting, smaller companies may use the cash basis of accounting.)
Examples of Revenue
Common examples of revenue include:

A retailer's sales of merchandise, sales of extended warranties, and repair revenues
The fees earned by a law firm for legal services provided to clients
The amounts earned by publishers of magazines, newspapers, and electronic information

Revenue vs Income
It is important to note that many people use the term income to mean revenue. Perhaps a business owner sees money ""coming in"" from customers and logically refers to it as ""income"". However, it is best to use the word sales or revenue when referring to the amounts earned from customers, and to use the word income for an amount that reflects the subtraction of expenses.",what
What is capitalized interest?,"Capitalized interest is the interest added to the cost of a self-constructed, long-term asset. It involves the interest on debt used to finance the asset's construction.
The details of capitalized interest are explained in the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 34, Capitalization of Interest Cost. You can find this accounting pronouncement at www.FASB.org/st.
In short, there must be debt involved (cash and common stock are not considered). The interest specified by the pronouncement is added to the cost of the project, instead of being expensed on the current period's income statement. This capitalized interest will be part of the asset's cost reported on the balance sheet, and will be part of the asset's depreciation expense that will be reported in future income statements.",what
What is a revenue expenditure?,"Definition of Revenue Expenditure
A revenue expenditure is a cost that will be an expense in the accounting period when the expenditure takes place.
Revenue expenditures are often discussed in the context of fixed assets. The revenue expenditures take place after a fixed asset had been put into service and simply keeps the asset in working order. (The amount spent to acquire a fixed asset is referred to as a capital expenditure. The amount of the capital expenditure will be recorded as an asset and will then be moved to the income statement as depreciation expense over the years of the asset's useful life.)
Example of Revenue Expenditure
Let's assume that a company made a capital expenditure of $100,000 to install a high efficiency machine. The new machine requires routine maintenance of $3,000 each month. This $3,000 is a revenue expenditure since it will be reported on the monthly income statement, thereby being matched with the month's revenues. Normal repairs to the machine are also a revenue expenditure, since the expenditure does not make the machine more than it was, nor does it extend the machine's useful life. As a result, normal repairs will also be reported on the income statement as an expense in the accounting period when the repair is made.",what
What is the income statement?,"Definition of Income Statement
The income statement is also known as the statement of operations, profit and loss statement, and statement of earnings. It is one of a company's main financial statements. The purpose of the income statement is to report a summary of a company's revenues, expenses, gains, losses, and the resulting net income that occurred during a year, quarter, or other period of time.
Examples of Items Appearing in the Income Statement
The main items reported in the income statement are:

Revenues, which are the amounts earned through the sale of goods and/or the providing of services
Expenses, which include the cost of goods sold, SG&A expenses, and interest expense
Gains and losses, such as the sale of a noncurrent asset for an amount that is different from its book value
Net income, which is the result of subtracting the company's expenses and losses from the company's revenues and gains. Corporations with shares of common stock that are publicly traded often refer to net income as earnings and their income statements must include the earnings per share of common stock

How the Income Statement Amounts are Calculated
The income statement amounts are best calculated for a specific period of time by using the accrual basis of accounting. Under the accrual basis the revenues are the amounts that were earned (not the amount of cash received), and the expenses are the amounts that best match the revenues or were used up during the period (not the cash that was paid out).",what
Why are loan costs amortized?,"Definition of Loan Costs
Loan costs may include legal and accounting fees, registration fees, appraisal fees, processing fees, etc. that were necessary costs in order to obtain a loan.
If the loan costs are significant, they must be amortized to interest expense over the life of the loan because of the matching principle.
Example of Amortizing Loan Costs
Assume that a company incurs loan costs of $120,000 during February in order to obtain a $4 million loan at an annual interest rate of 9%. The loan will begin on March 1 and the entire $4 million of principal will be due five years later. In addition to the one-time loan costs of $120,000 the company will also have the cost of the borrowed money which is $360,000 ($4 million X 9%) of interest each year for five years.
It would be misleading to report the entire $120,000 of loan costs as an expense for the month of February. Hence, the matching principle requires that each month during the life of the loan the company should report $2,000 ($120,000 divided by 60 months) of loan costs as interest expense in addition to the interest expense of $30,000 per month ($4 million X 9% per year = $360,000 per year divided by 12 months per year). The combination of the monthly amortization of $2,000 and the monthly interest expense of $30,000 results in total monthly interest expense of $32,000 for each of the 60 months beginning on March 1.",what
What are goods in transit?,"Definition of Goods in Transit
Goods in transit refers to inventory items and other products that have been shipped by a seller, but have not yet reached the purchaser.
When goods are in transit at the end of an accounting period, they require special accounting attention since the goods are not physically present at either the seller's or the buyer's location. It is necessary to examine whether the sales terms were FOB shipping point or FOB destination. The rules to be followed are:

If the terms are FOB shipping point, the goods in transit are the property of the buyer
If the terms are FOB destination, the goods in transit are the property of the seller

Example of Goods in Transit
Let's assume that both a company (seller) and its customer (buyer) have accounting periods which end on December 31. The company ships a truckload of merchandise on December 30 to a customer who is located 2,000 miles away. The merchandise arrives at the customer's location on January 2. Between December 30 and January 2, the merchandise is an example of goods in transit. 
If the terms are FOB shipping point, the company (seller) will record a sale and receivable as of December 30, and will not include the goods in transit as its December 31 inventory. On December 31, the customer (buyer) is the owner of the goods in transit and will need to report a purchase, a payable, and must include the cost of the goods in transit in its inventory cost.
If the terms of the sale are FOB destination, the company (seller) will not have a sale and receivable until January 2. This means the company (seller) must include the cost of the goods in transit in its inventory as of December 31. [The customer (buyer) will not have a purchase, payable, or inventory of the goods as of December 31. The customer's (buyer's) purchase, payable, and increase in inventory will occur on January 2.]",what
What are the effects of depreciation?,"Definition of Depreciation
Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the cost of a company's assets used in its business from the balance sheet to the income statement (as an expense) over their estimated useful lives.
Depreciation occurs through an accounting adjusting entry in which the account Depreciation Expense is debited and the contra asset account Accumulated Depreciation is credited.
Effects of Depreciation
The following are some of the effects for a corporation that is depreciating assets:

The net income, retained earnings, and stockholders' equity are reduced with the debit to Depreciation Expense
The carrying value of the assets being depreciated and amount of total assets are reduced by the credit to Accumulated Depreciation
The depreciation expense reported on the U.S. income tax return (based on the tax regulations) reduces a corporation's taxable income (and its related income tax payments).",what
What are accounting principles?,"Definition of Accounting Principles
Accounting principles are the common rules that must be followed when preparing financial statements that are distributed to people outside of the company (or other organization).
Examples of Accounting Principles
The basic underlying accounting principles, guidelines and assumptions include the following:

the cost principle
matching principle
full disclosure principle
revenue recognition principle
industry-specific regulatory rules
materiality, conservatism, consistency, and others

In the U.S. the accounting principles also include the many complex, detailed rules that are established and maintained by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).
The combination of the basic underlying guidelines and the complex detailed accounting rules are referred to as generally accepted accounting principles (or US GAAP or GAAP).",what
What is historical cost?,"Definition of Historical Cost
Historical cost is a term used instead of the term cost. Cost and historical cost usually mean the original cost at the time of a transaction.
The term historical cost distinguishes an asset's cost from its replacement cost, current cost, or inflation-adjusted cost. 
Generally, the cost principle or historical cost principle requires that an asset should be reported at its cash or cash equivalent amount at the time of the transaction and should include all costs necessary to get the asset in place and ready for use.
Example of Historical Cost
Let's assume that a company purchased land in 1997 for $100,000. It continues to own the land and has not made any improvements. Today the land should be reported on the company's balance sheet at its historical cost of $100,000 even though its current cost, replacement cost, inflation-adjusted cost, appraised value, and assessed value amounts range from $150,000 to $270,000.",what
What is comprehensive income?,"Definition of Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive income for a corporation is the combination of the following amounts which occurred during a specified period of time such as a year, quarter, month, etc.:

Net income or net loss (the details of which are reported on the corporation's income statement), plus
Other comprehensive income (if any)

Examples of other comprehensive income include:

Unrealized gains/losses on hedging derivatives
Foreign currency translation adjustments
Unrealized gains/losses on postretirement benefit plans

Basically, comprehensive income consists of all of the revenues, gains, expenses, and losses that caused stockholders' equity to change during the accounting period.
The amount of net income for the period is added to retained earnings, while the amount of other comprehensive income is added to accumulated other comprehensive income. Retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income are reported on separate lines within stockholders' equity on the end-of-the-period balance sheet.",what
When should costs be expensed and when should costs be capitalized?,"Definition of Costs
In the context of the question, costs are the amounts paid in exchange for materials, products, or services. The costs could be:

Reported as an expense on the current period's income statement, or
Reported as an asset and expensed later. To defer the cost to the balance sheet is to capitalize the costs.

Examples of Costs Being Expensed
Costs are reported as expenses  in the accounting period when they are used up, have expired, or have no future economic value which can be measured. For example, the June salaries for the company's marketing team should be reported as an expense in June since the future economic value cannot be measured/determined.
Another example is the amount spent to repair equipment that broke in June and was repaired in June. The cost of the repair merely restored the equipment to its same condition. Since there was no additional future economic value added, the costs of repair is reported as an expense on the June income statement.
Example of Costs Being Capitalized
Costs are capitalized (recorded as assets) when the costs have not been used up and have future economic value. Assume that a company incurs a cost of $30,000 in June to add a hydraulic lift to its delivery truck that had no lift. The remaining useful life of the truck and the lift is 5 years. The cost of $30,000 should be capitalized since it added future economic value by making an improvement to the truck. The $30,000 cost increases the company's assets, but will be reduced by depreciating the cost to expense over the next 5 years.",what
What is accrued income?,"Definition of Accrued Income
Accrued income is an amount that:

A company has earned
The company has a right to receive
The collection is probable
Has not yet been recorded in the general ledger accounts

Under the accrual basis of accounting, accrued income is recorded with an accrual adjusting entry prior to issuing the financial statements.
Example of Accrued Income
One example of accrued income is the interest a company earns on a bond investment. To illustrate, let's assume that a company invested $100,000 on December 1 in a 6% $100,000 bond that pays $3,000 of interest on each June 1 and December 1. On December 31, the company will have earned one month's interest amounting to $500 ($100,000 x 6% per year x 1/12 of a year, or 1/6 of the semiannual $3,000). No interest will be received in December since it will be included in the $3,000 interest that will be received on June 1. The $500 of interest that has been earned during December, but not yet received nor previously recorded as of December 31, is accrued interest income.
The accrued interest income will be recorded with an accrual adjusting entry dated December 31 that debits Interest Receivable (a balance sheet account) for $500, and credits Interest Income (an income statement account) for $500.",what
Is a loan payment an expense?,"Definition of Loan Payment
Generally a loan payment consists of:

An interest payment, which is an expense
A principal payment, which reduces the loan's principal balance

If the interest and principal portions of the loan payment are not listed, a loan amortization schedule will indicate the amounts.
If the loan payments are made on the last day of every month, the interest payment (or interest portion of the loan payment) will likely be the expense for the month. However, if the loan payment is made on a different day of the month, an accrual adjusting entry will be required to report the precise amount of interest for the month and the accrued interest liability at the end of the month.
The loan's principal balance is a liability such as Loans Payable or Notes Payable. The principal payments that are required in the next 12 months should be classified as a current liability. The remaining amount of principal owed should be classified as a long-term (or noncurrent) liability.
Example of Loan Payment
A company makes monthly payments of $500.00 on the last day of every month. Each month the interest portion decreases and the principal portion increases (as the result of a decreasing principal balance). A loan amortization schedule indicates that the interest portion of this month's payment is $112.49 and the principal portion is $387.51. Therefore, the loan payment will be recorded as follows:

Debit Interest Expense for $112.49
Debit Loan Payable for $387.51
Credit Cash for $500.00",what
What is accrued payroll?,"Definition of Accrued Payroll
Accrued payroll includes wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses, and other payroll related expenses that have been earned by a company's employees, but have not yet been paid or recorded in the company's general ledger accounts.
Example of Accrued Payroll
Let's assume that a retailer's hourly-paid employees are paid each Friday for the hours they worked during the previous week. Let's also assume that as of December 31, the hours worked from December 27 through December 31 will be part of the payroll that will be processed in early January and paid to the employees on Friday, January 8. The amount of the wages for the five days of December 27 through December 31 are calculated to be $5,000. In addition, the retailer incurred payroll taxes and fringe benefits amounting to $1,000. Therefore, the total amount of accrued payroll is $6,000.
Under the accrual basis of accounting, the retailer must report the $6,500 of accrued payroll as:

An expense on its income statement for the period ended December 31
Current liability on its balance sheet as of December 31

The retailer will accomplish this by preparing an accrual adjusting entry dated as of December 31.",what
Is sales tax an expense or a liability?,"Definition of Sales Tax
In the U.S., a sales tax is a state tax (and possibly an additional local tax) that is paid by the buyer at the time of purchase. The amount of the sales tax is based on the product and the sales tax rate. For instance, in some states unprepared grocery items are not subject to a sales tax. Items purchased for resale are not subject to the sales tax when purchased by the retailer, but will be subject to the sales tax when the items are sold to the end customer. In some cities, there could be a state sales tax of 6% plus a county tax of 1% and a tourist district sales tax of 3%. In another state there could be only a sales tax rate of 8%.
The sales taxes collected by a merchant are not part of the merchant's sales and are not part of the merchant's expenses. Instead, the merchant is merely an agent of the state and will record the sales taxes collected as a current liability. When the merchant remits the sales taxes to the state, the current liability account is reduced. 
If a company purchases a new delivery van, the sales taxes paid on the van are recorded as part of the cost of the van. The total cost of the van will then be charged to depreciation expense over the van's useful life.
Examples of Sales Tax
If a company sells $100,000 of merchandise that is subject to a state sales tax of 7%, the company will collect $107,000. The journal entry to record this information is:

Debit Cash for $107,000
Credit Sales (or Sales Revenues) for $100,000
Credit Sales Taxes Payable for $7,000

When the company remits the $7,000 to the state, the company will credit Cash and debit Sales Taxes Payable. Note that in this example that the sales tax is not an expense and it is not part of the company's sales revenues.
If a company purchases a new delivery van for $50,000 plus $3,500 of sales tax, the company will record the truck as an asset at its total cost of $53,500. In this situation, the sales tax of $3,500 is considered to be a necessary cost of the truck and will be part of the depreciation expense recorded during the useful life of the truck.",what
How does an expense affect the balance sheet?,"Definition of Expense
An expense is a cost that has been used up, expired, or is directly related to the earning of revenues.
Most of a company's expenses fall into the following categories:

cost of goods sold
sales, general and administrative expenses
interest expense

How an Expense Affects the Balance Sheet
An expense will decrease a corporation's retained earnings (which is part of stockholders' equity) or will decrease a sole proprietor's capital account (which is part of owner's equity).
In addition to affecting retained earnings or the owner's capital account, an expense will also cause one or more of the following changes to the balance sheet:

A decrease in Cash, Prepaid Expenses, Supplies on Hand, Inventory
An increase in the credit balance in the contra-asset account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts or Accumulated Depreciation
An increase in the balance in the liability account Accounts Payable, or an increase in Accrued Expenses Payable (including Wages Payable, Interest Payable, etc.)",what
Why is income received in advance a liability?,"Definition of Income Received in Advance
Under the accrual method of accounting, when a company receives money from a customer prior to earning it, the company will have to make the following entry:

Debit Cash
Credit a liability account such as Deferred Revenue, Deferred Income, Unearned Revenue

The credit to the liability account is made because the company has not yet earned the money and the company has an obligation to deliver the goods or services (or to return the money) to the customer. Accountants will state that the company is deferring the revenue until it is earned. Once the money is earned, the liability will be decreased and a revenue account will be increased.
Example of Income Received in Advance
Assume that Jones Corporation received $10,000 from a customer on December 31 for work that will be done in the following month. On December 31, Jones Corporation will debit Cash for $10,000 and will credit Deferred Revenue for $10,000. Therefore, Jones Corporation's December 31 balance sheet's Cash will include the $10,000 and its current liabilities will report Deferred Revenue of $10,000.
After Jones Corporation delivers the goods or services, it will debit Deferred Revenue for $10,000 and will credit Sales Revenues or Service Revenues for $10,000.",what
How do you record the interest that is unpaid on a note payable?,"Definition of Interest Unpaid on Note Payable
Interest that has occurred, but has not been paid as of a balance sheet date, is referred to as accrued interest.
Under the accrual basis of accounting, the amount that has occurred but is unpaid should be recorded with a debit to Interest Expense and a credit to the current liability Interest Payable.
Example of Recording Unpaid Interest
Let's assume that on December 10, a company made its monthly payment on a loan and the payment included interest through December 10. On the company's financial statements dated December 31, the company will need to report the interest expense and liability for December 11 through 31. This is done with an accrual adjusting entry dated December 31. If the interest for December 11 through December 31 was $100, the adjusting entry dated December 31 will debit Interest Expense for $100, and will credit Interest Payable for $100.",what
What is carriage inwards?,"Definition of Carriage Inwards
Carriage inwards refers to the transportation costs required to be paid by the purchaser when it receives merchandise it ordered with terms FOB shipping point. Carriage inwards is also known as freight-in or transportation-in.
Carriage inwards is considered to be part of the cost of the items purchased. Hence, for inventory items carriage inwards will be part of the cost of the goods available, the cost of inventory, and the cost of goods sold.
Example of Carriage Inwards
Assume that a company uses the periodic inventory method and it purchases goods with terms FOB shipping point. As a result the company is responsible for paying the cost of the carriage inwards. The company will record the amount in the general ledger account Carriage Inwards (or Freight-in or Transportation-in). The carriage inwards costs are considered to be part of the cost of items purchased, since an asset's cost is defined as all costs that are necessary to get the asset in place and ready for use.",what
What is the difference between net cash flow and net income?,"Under the accrual method of accounting, net income is calculated as follows: revenues earned minus the expenses incurred in order to earn those revenues. If a company earns revenues in December but allows those customers to pay in 30 days, the cash from the December revenues will likely be received in January. In this situation the December revenues will increase the December net income, but will not increase the company's December net cash flow.
Under accrual accounting, expenses are matched to the accounting period when the related revenues occur or when the costs have expired. For example, a retailer may have purchased and paid for merchandise in October. However, the merchandise remained in inventory until it was sold in December. The company's net cash flow decreases in October when the company pays for the merchandise. However, net income decreases in December when the cost of the goods sold is matched with the December sales.
There are many other examples of expenses occurring in one accounting period but the payments occur in a different accounting period. In short, the statement of cash flows is a needed financial statement because the income statement does not report cash flows.",what
What is a contingent asset?,"Definition of Contingent Asset
A contingent asset is a potential asset that is associated with a potential gain. The asset and gain are contingent because they are dependent upon some future event occurring or not occurring.
Because of the concept of conservatism, a contingent asset and gain will not be recorded in a general ledger account or reported on the financial statements until they are certain. [This is different from contingent liabilities and contingent losses, which are recorded in accounts and reported on the financial statements when they are probable and the amount can be estimated.
Example of Contingent Asset
An example of a contingent asset (and its related contingent gain) is a lawsuit filed by Company A against a competitor for infringing on Company A's patent. Even if it is probable (but not certain) that Company A will win the lawsuit, it is a contingent asset and a contingent gain. As such, it will not be recorded in Company A's general ledger accounts until the lawsuit is settled. (At most, Company A could prepare a carefully worded disclosure stating that it has filed the lawsuit but the outcome is uncertain.)",what
How should the sale of gift certificates be recorded in the general ledger?,"Definition of Gift Certificates
Gift certificates (and gift cards) are often sold by a retailer to a buyer for cash. The buyer can then redeem the gift certificate or give it to another person who can redeem the gift certificate for merchandise or services.
Accounting for the Sale of Gift Certificates
The sale of a gift certificate should be recorded with a debit to Cash and a credit to a liability account such as Gift Certificates Outstanding.
Note that revenue is not recorded at this point. Rather, the retailer is recording its obligation/liability to provide merchandise or services for the amount of the certificate sold.
Accounting for the Redemption of a Gift Certificate
When a gift certificate is presented to the retailer, revenue will be recorded by the retailer for the amount of merchandise or services that were provided. This is done with a debit to the liability account Gift Certificates Outstanding and a credit to a revenue account.
Our explanation pertains to financial accounting. To learn about the income tax treatment of this transaction, you should seek advice from a tax professional or go to www.irs.gov.",what
What is insurance expense?,"Definition of Insurance Expense
Under the accrual basis of accounting, insurance expense is the cost of insurance that has been incurred, has expired, or has been used up during the current accounting period for the nonmanufacturing functions of a business.
A manufacturer will report on its income statement the insurance expense incurred for its selling, general and administrative functions. However, the insurance costs associated with the manufacturing function are included in the cost of the current period's output. Any prepaid insurance costs are to be reported as a current asset.
Example of Insurance Expense
Let's assume that a retailer has insurance policies for its property, general liability, vehicles, and employees' worker compensation, medical, dental, life, and disability. The company pays the premiums on the various insurance policies in advance. Any insurance premium costs that have not expired as of the balance sheet date should be reported as a current asset such as Prepaid Insurance. The costs that have expired should be reported in income statement accounts such as Insurance Expense, Fringe Benefits Expense, etc. Here's a recap for the cost of insurance at the retailer:

Expired insurance premiums are reported as Insurance Expense.
Unexpired insurance premiums are reported as Prepaid Insurance (an asset account).

If the retailer has incurred some insurance expense but has not yet paid the premiums, the retailer should debit Insurance Expense and credit Insurance Premiums Payable.",what
Where in the chart of accounts is a suspense account located?,"Suspense Account in the Chart of Accounts
A suspense account could be located in any one of these sections of an organization's chart of accounts:

Asset
Liability
Revenue
Expense

Examples of Suspense Accounts
Assume that a company receives cash of $500 but cannot readily determine the reason why it received the $500. Obviously, the company's asset Cash is to be debited, but the account to be credited (required by the double-entry system) for $500 is not known. The unknown account could be in any of the following sections of the chart of accounts:

Asset section if the cash was from the sale of another asset or the collection of an asset
Liability section if the cash was a deposit for future work to be done
Revenue section if the cash was for work that was recently earned, but not yet billed
Expense account if the cash was a refund of an earlier expense

Unfortunately, the best section may not be known at the time of the receipt, and it is hard to say where you will find the suspense account in your own chart of accounts and general ledger.",what
What is a customer deposit?,"Definition of Customer Deposit
A customer deposit could be money that a company receives from a customer prior to the company earning it (by providing the customer with goods or services). In other words, the company receives the asset Cash and has an obligation to provide the goods or services to the customer or to return the money. Hence, the current liability account Customer Deposits is credited. When the company earns the deposit amount, the current liability will be debited and Sales Revenues will be credited.
A customer deposit could also refer to the money a bank receives from a depositor. Since the bank is not earning this money, the amount is recorded by the bank with a debit to Cash and a credit to Customer Deposits.
Example of Customer Deposit
Let's assume that Ace Manufacturing Inc. agrees to produce an expensive, custom-made machine for one of its customers. Ace requires that the customer pay $50,000 before Ace begins to design and construct the machine. The $50,000 payment is made in December 2018 and the machine must be finished by March 31, 2019. The $50,000 is a down payment toward the machine's price of $400,000.
In December 2018 Ace will debit Cash for $50,000 and will credit Customer Deposits, a current liability account. When the machine is completed in 2019, Ace will debit Customer Deposits for $50,000 and will credit Sales Revenues for $50,000.",what
Is the installation labor for a new asset expensed or included in the cost of the asset?,"Accounting for Labor to Install Asset
The definition of an asset's cost is all costs that are necessary to get an asset in place and ready for use. Therefore, the cost of the installation labor (wages and related fringe benefits) is part of the cost of the asset (and not an immediate expense of the accounting period).
The total cost of the asset, including installation costs, will become an expense when the asset depreciated over the asset's useful life.",what
What is a financial statement?,"Definition of Financial Statement
Generally, the term financial statement could be referring to:

General-purpose, external financial reports that are distributed by a company to people outside of the company
A more-detailed, internal financial report that remains inside of the company for use by the company's management

The external financial statements of a U.S. corporation must be prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (referred to as US GAAP).
Examples of Financial Statements
The external financial statements issued by U.S. corporations should include all of the following:

Income statement
Statement of comprehensive income
Balance sheet or statement of financial position
Statement of cash flows
Statement of stockholders' equity",what
How do you divide the cost of real estate into land and building?,"Dividing the Cost of Real Estate into Land and Building
In accounting, the cost of real estate must be divided into:

The cost of land (because land is not depreciated)
The cost of the structures (because these require depreciation)

Example of Dividing the Cost of Real Estate
Assume that a company purchases real estate (which includes land and a building) at a cost of $220,000. The appraisal at the time of the purchase indicates that the land has a market value of $50,000 and the building has a market value of $200,000...for a total market value of $250,000. In other words, the appraisal indicates that the land is 20% ($50,000/$250,000) of the market value, and the building is 80% ($200,000/$250,000) of the market value.
The cost principle requires that the purchase be recorded at its cost of $220,000. However, we can use the appraisal amounts as a logical way to divide up the cost of $220,000 between land and building. Here is one approach:

Assign or allocate $44,000 to the account Land. This is 20% of the $220,000 cost.
Assign or allocate $176,000 to the account Buildings. This is 80% of the $220,000 cost

A second approach is to compare the real estate's total cost of $220,000 to the total appraisal amount of $250,000. This shows that the total cost is 88% ($220,000/$250,000) of the total market value. Using this approach we will:

Assign or allocate 88% of the $50,000 market value = $44,000 to the Land account
Assign or allocate 88% of the $200,000 market value = $176,000 to the Buildings account",what
What are inventoriable costs?,"Inventoriable costs are 1) the costs to purchase or manufacture products which will be resold, plus 2) the costs to get those products in place and ready for sale. Inventoriable costs are also known as product costs.
To illustrate, let's assume that a retailer purchases an item for resale by paying $20 to the supplier. The item is purchased FOB shipping point, which means that the retailer must pay the freight from the supplier to its location. If that freight cost is $1, then the retailer's inventoriable cost is $21. Assuming this is the only item in the retailer's inventory, the retailer's balance sheet will report inventory at a cost of $21. When the item is sold, the retailer's inventory will decrease by $21 and the $21 will be reported on the income statement as the cost of goods sold.
In the case of a manufacturer, a product's inventoriable costs are the costs of the direct materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead incurred in manufacturing the product.",what
What is cost incurred?,"Definition of Cost Incurred
A cost incurred is a cost that a company (or other organization) becomes liable for.
Example of Cost Incurred
Assume that a retailer begins operations on December 1 and its electric meter is read by the utility on the last day of every month. During December the retailer will have incurred the cost of the electricity it used during December.
Under the accrual basis of accounting the retailer must report a current liability on December 31 for the amount owed to the utility for the electricity it used to that point. On its income statement for December, the retailer must also report electricity expense for the cost of the electricity that it used during December. This may require the retailer to record an accrual adjusting entries with an estimated amount (if the electricity bill is not received in time).",what
What does a balance sheet tell us?,"Definition of Balance Sheet
A balance sheet reports the dollar amounts of a company's assets, liabilities, and  owner's equity (or stockholders' equity) as of midnight of the date shown in the heading.
Examples of Balance Sheet Elements
Assets that are reported on the balance sheet are the company's resources such as cash, accounts receivable, inventory, investments, land, buildings, equipment, some intangible assets . Generally assets are reported at their cost or a lower amount due to the cost principle, depreciation, and conservatism. The cost principle also means that some very valuable aspects of the company are not listed as assets. For example, a company's outstanding reputation, its effective management team, and its amazing brand recognition are not reported as assets if they were not acquired in a transaction involving another party or entity.
Liabilities are a company's obligations as of the balance sheet date and will include loans payable, accounts payable, accrued expenses not yet recorded in accounts payable, warranty obligations, taxes payable, and more.
Stockholders' equity or owner's equity reports the amounts that were invested by the owners plus the company's earnings that the owners chose not to withdraw as dividends or drawings.
Additional Balance Sheet Information
The balance sheet classifications allow the reader to easily compute the amount of a company's working capital and to determine if a company is highly leveraged.
Every balance sheet that is distributed by a company should include notes (or footnote disclosures). These notes provide important additional information concerning the company's financial position including potential liabilities not included in the amounts reported on the face of the balance sheet.",what
How do you account for a project under construction?,"Accounting for a Project Under Construction
If a company is constructing a major project such as a building, assembly line, etc., the amounts spent on the project will be debited to a long-term asset account categorized as Construction Work-in-Progress.
Construction Work-in-Progress is often reported as the last line within the balance sheet classification Property, Plant and Equipment.
There is no depreciation of the accumulated costs until the project is completed and the asset is placed into service.
When the completed asset is placed into service, the project's accumulated costs will be removed from the Construction Work-in-Progress account and will be debited to the appropriate plant asset account.",what
What is the difference between revenues and receipts?,"Definition of Revenues
A company's revenues are amounts it has earned as the result of business activities such as selling merchandise or performing services. Under the accrual method of accounting, revenues are reported on the income statement in the period in which they are earned even though the dependable customers will pay the company 30 days later.
Example of Revenues
On June 10, a company sells $4,000 of goods to one of its best customers with credit terms of net 30 days. On June 10, the company has revenues of $4,000 which will be recorded with a debit of $4,000 to Accounts Receivable and a credit of $4,000 to Sales Revenues. 
Definition of Receipts
A company's receipts  refers to the cash that the company received.
Examples of Receipts
The following are some examples of receipts which are not revenues:

Borrowing $1,000 in cash from the bank
Collecting $4,000 from a sale that was recorded one month earlier
Disposing of a company vehicle and receiving cash that is equal to the vehicle's book value
Receiving $1,000 from an employee who had borrowed $1,000 from the company several weeks earlier
Receiving cash from an investor for new shares of the company's common stock

Example of Both a Revenue and a Receipt
When a company makes a $200 cash sale (or performs services for $200 of cash) the company has earned revenue of $200 and has a receipt of $200.",what
Is advertising an asset or an expense?,"Definition of Advertising Expense
Advertising is the amount a company incurs to promote its products, brands, and image via television, radio, magazines, Internet, etc. Since the accountants cannot measure the future benefit of the advertising, the advertising costs must be reported as Advertising Expense at the time the ads are run.
A prepayment of the cost of ads that will air in the future should be recorded in a current asset account such as Prepaid Advertising. When the ad is aired, the amount must be transferred from Prepaid Advertising to Advertising Expense.
Example of Advertising as an Asset and as an Expense
Let's assume that in December a corporation paid $15 million to prepare an ad and to book a time for it to be shown during the Super Bowl Game in early February. Until February, the $15 million is the current asset Prepaid Advertising. After the ad is shown in the Super Bowl Game, the corporation must credit Prepaid Advertising and debit Advertising Expense. This is necessary because the accountants cannot measure the sales (if any) that will occur because of the Super Bowl ad.",what
What are accrued revenues and when are they recorded?,"Accrued revenues are fees and interest that have been earned and sales that occurred, but they have not yet been recorded through the normal invoicing paperwork. Since these are not yet in the accountant's general ledger, they will not appear on the financial statements unless an adjusting entry is entered prior to preparing the financial statements.
Here's an example. Your company lent a supplier $100,000 on December 1. The agreement is for the $100,000 to be repaid on February 28 along with $3,000 of interest for the three months of December through February. As of December 31 your company will not have a transaction/invoice/receipt for the interest it is earning since all of the interest is due on February 28. Without an adjusting entry to accrue the revenue it earned in December, your company's financial statements as of December 31 will not be reporting the $1,000 (one-third of the $3,000 of interest) that it has earned in December. In order for the financial statements to be correct on the accrual basis of accounting, the accountant needs to record an adjusting entry dated as of December 31. The adjusting entry will consist of a debit of $1,000 to Interest Receivable (a balance sheet account) and a credit of $1,000 to Interest Income or Interest Revenue (income statement accounts).",what
How do you amortize goodwill?,"Prior to 2001, the U.S. accounting rules required goodwill to be amortized to expense over a period not to exceed 40 years. However, in June 2001 the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued its Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. This accounting pronouncement ended the automatic amortization of goodwill to expense for U.S. financial reporting.
While goodwill is no longer amortized to expense in uniform increments, goodwill is to be measured annually to determine if there is an impairment loss. (However beginning in 2015, private companies may opt to amortize goodwill generally over a 10-year period and thereby minimize the cost and complexity involved with testing for impairment.)",what
Why are accruals needed every month?,"Reasons for Monthly Accruals
Accrual adjusting entries are needed monthly only if a company issues monthly financial statements.
Two reasons for the monthly accrual adjusting entries are:

To report the revenues and the related receivables which were earned during the month, but the transactions had not been recorded in the accounts as of the end of the month
To record the expenses, losses, and their related liabilities which were incurred during the month, but the transactions had not been recorded in the accounts as of the end of the month

Monthly accruals and deferrals and other adjusting entries must be recorded prior to issuing monthly financial statements in order to comply with the accrual basis of accounting.",what
What is the conservatism principle?,"The conservatism principle directs an accountant who is faced with two alternatives. To illustrate, let's assume that a company has an inventory with a cost of $15,000. However, the marketplace has changed dramatically and now the inventory can be sold for only $14,000 if the company spends an additional $2,000 to package and ship the goods.
For the next balance sheet the accountant is faced with 1) continuing to report the inventory at its cost of $15,000 or 2) to report the inventory at its net realizable value (NRV) of $12,000. (NRV is equal to the estimated sales value of $14,000 minus $2,000 of expenses necessary to get the $14,000.) Expressed another way, on the next income statement the accountant is faced with 1) ignoring the loss in inventory value until the goods are actually sold, or 2) reporting the loss immediately. 
The concept of conservatism directs the accountant to 1) report the inventory at the lower NRV of $12,000 and 2) to report immediately a lower net income due to the inventory write down $3,000 on its income statement. (The $3,000 loss is the write down from the cost of $15,000 to the NRV of $12,000.)
The conservatism principle does not say that accountants are to be super conservative. Accountants should be fair and objective. The conservatism principle says if there is doubt between two alternatives, the accountant should opt for the one that reports a lesser asset amount or a greater liability amount, and a lesser amount of net income.",what
What are cost flow assumptions?,"Definition of Cost Flow Assumptions
The term cost flow assumptions refers to the manner in which costs are removed from a company's inventory and are reported as the cost of goods sold. In the U.S. the cost flow assumptions include FIFO, LIFO, and average. (If specific identification is used, there is no need to make an assumption.)
FIFO, LIFO, average are assumptions because the flow of costs out of inventory does not have to match the way the items were physically removed from inventory.
Example of Cost Flow Assumptions
To illustrate, let's assume that a company has four units of the same product in its inventory. The units were purchased at increasing costs and in the following sequence: $40, $41, $43, and $44. If the company physically removes and sells the oldest unit (the unit that had a cost of $40), the cost removed from inventory and reported as the cost of goods sold (COGS) will vary depending on the cost flow assumption:

Under the FIFO cost flow assumption, the oldest cost of $40 is removed from inventory and charged to COGS
Under the LIFO cost flow assumption, the most recent cost of $44 is removed from inventory and charged to COGS
Under the average cost flow assumption, the average cost of $42 is removed from inventory and charged to COGS

Other than a one-time change to a better cost flow assumption, the company must consistently use the same cost flow assumption.",what
What is direct labor?,"Definition of Direct Labor
Direct labor refers to the employees and temporary staff who work directly on a manufacturer's products. (People working in the production area, but not directly on the products, are referred to as indirect labor.)
The direct labor cost includes the wages and fringe benefits of the direct labor employees and the cost of the temporary staff that are working directly on the manufacturer's products.
The direct labor cost is classified as the following:

A product cost (along with the costs of the direct materials and manufacturing overhead)
An inventoriable cost (along with the costs of the direct materials and manufacturing overhead)
A prime cost (along with direct materials)
A conversion cost (along with manufacturing overhead)",what
What is the difference between assessed value and appraised value?,"Definition of Assessed Value
Assessed value will likely be the amount that a local or state government has designated for individual properties. This assessed value is used in determining the amount of property tax that the property owner will be assessed and will owe.
Example of Assessed Value
Assume that a company's warehouse is located in a city. The city tax assessor is responsible for determining the assessed value for every parcel of land and every building within the city. The city government then establishes a real estate tax rate to be applied to the assessed values. (There could also be assessed values for personal property.)
The assessed values of real estate or personal property are not necessarily equal to the property's current market value.
Definition of Appraised Value
Appraised value is the amount (or amounts) contained in an appraisal report for a specific property. The appraisal report is generally prepared by a professional appraiser who looks at the property's features including size, type of construction, location, condition, and recent sales of comparable property in the vicinity. The appraised value is an attempt to determine the property's current market value. The appraisal report for real estate will usually report the appraised value of the land separate from the appraised value of the structures. An accountant might use the relationship of these appraised values to allocate the cost of real estate into the cost of the land and the cost of the buildings.
Example of Appraised Value
Appraised values are useful because a company's balance sheet will report its land and buildings at the cost when they were acquired and will report the accumulated depreciation of the buildings. (Land is not depreciated.) Therefore, if the company wants to refinance its real estate, a current appraisal will usually be required.",what
What is accrued rent?,"Definition of Accrued Rent
Accrued rent is the amount of rent that has not yet been paid by the tenant or received by the landlord for a past period of time. [If the tenant always pays the monthly rent on the first day of every, there will never be any accrued rent.] 
Under the accrual method of accounting the tenant should report:

Rent Expense during the period of time that the space was occupied but was not paid, and
A current liability Rent Payable for the amount owed to the landlord at each balance sheet date

Under the accrual method of accounting and assuming that the amount will be collected, the landlord should report:

Rent Revenue (or Rental Income) during the period of time that the space was occupied but the rent was not received from the tenant, and
A current asset Rent Receivable for the amount owed by the tenant at each balance sheet date

Example of Accrued Rent
A landlord and tenant agree to a monthly rent of $1,000 for office space beginning on October 1. Each month's rent is to be paid on the first day of the month. The tenant paid the monthly rent on October 1 and November 1, but asked the landlord if the December rent could be paid on February 1 (when the tenant will be receiving a large payment from a client). The landlord is assured that all rent due will be paid by February 1. Assuming that the tenant and the landlord use the accrual method of accounting, the following accrual adjusting entries are needed prior to issuing the December 31 financial statements:

The tenant will debit Rent Expense for $1,000 and will credit Rent Payable for $1,000
The landlord will debit Rent Receivable for $1,000 and will credit Rent Revenues for $1,000",what
Why isn't the direct write off method of uncollectible accounts receivable the preferred method?,"Definition of Direct Write Off Method
Under the direct write off method of accounting for credit losses pertaining to accounts receivable, no bad debts expense is reported on the income statement until an account receivable is actually removed from the company's receivables.
Under the direct write off method there is no contra asset account such as  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. This means that the balance sheet is reporting the full amount of accounts receivable and therefore implying that the full amount will be converted to cash.
Reason Why the Direct Write Off Method is Not Preferred
The accounting profession does not prefer the direct method for the following reasons:

The accounts receivable are more likely to be reported on the balance sheet at an amount that is greater than the amount that will actually be collected
The bad debts expense resulting from having sold goods on credit will appear on the income statement only after the bad account is identified and removed from the company's accounts receivable. Hence, the bad debts expense is reported much later than would be the case under the allowance method.

[The Internal Revenue Service requires the direct write off method in order to prevent taxpayers from claiming a bad debts expenses based on an anticipated potential loss.]",what
What is interest payable?,"Definition of Interest Payable
Interest payable is the interest expense that has been incurred (has already occurred) but has not been paid as of the date of the balance sheet. [Interest payable does not include the interest for periods after the date of the balance sheet.]
Example of Interest Payable
Let's assume that on December 1 a company borrowed $100,000 at an annual interest rate of 12%. The company agrees to repay the principal amount of $100,000 plus 9 months of interest when the note comes due on August 31.
On December 31, the amount of interest payable is $1,000 ($100,000 X 12% X 1/12) and the company's balance sheet should report the following current liabilities:

Notes payable of $100,000
Interest payable of $1,000

Nothing is reported for the $8,000 of future interest.
The company's January 31 balance sheet should report the following current liabilities:

Notes payable of $100,000
Interest payable of $2,000",what
What is the difference between revenues and earnings?,"A U.S. corporation's revenues  are reported on the top line of its income statement, while its earnings are reported on the bottom line (or near the bottom) of the income statement.
Revenues is the gross amount earned from selling goods or providing services during the period shown in the heading of the income statement. In other words, revenues is the amount earned before deducting the cost of goods sold, expenses, and losses.
Earnings is the net amount earned after deducting the cost of goods sold, expenses and losses. It is often presented as net earnings or net income. When a corporation's stock is publicly-traded, the earnings must also be reported on the income statement as earnings per share (EPS) of common stock.",what
What is the monetary unit assumption?,"Definition of Monetary Unit Assumption
The monetary unit assumption as it applies to a U.S. corporation is that the U.S.dollar (USD) is stable in the long run. That is the USD does not lose its purchasing power. Note that this is the assumption.
As a result of the monetary assumption, accountants at a U.S. corporation do not hesitate to add the cost of a parcel of land purchased in 2019 to the cost of another parcel of land that had been purchased in 1970. (See example below.)
Another part of the monetary unit assumption is that U.S. accountants report a corporation's assets in dollar amounts (rather than reporting details of all of the assets). If an asset cannot be expressed as a dollar amount, it cannot be entered in a general ledger account. For example, the management team of a very successful corporation may be the corporation's most valuable asset. However, the accountant is not able to objectively convert those talented people into USDs. Hence, the management team will not be included in the reported amounts on the balance sheet.
Example of Monetary Unit Assumption
Let's illustrate the monetary unit assumption with the following hypothetical example. A U.S. corporation purchased a two-acre parcel of land at a cost of $40,000 in 1970. Then in 2019 the corporation purchased an adjacent (nearly identical) two-acre parcel at a cost of $500,000. After the 2019 purchase is recorded, the balance in the corporation's general ledger account Land is $540,000. Therefore, the corporation's balance sheet will report its four acres of land at a cost of $540,000. There is no adjustment for the vast difference in purchasing power between the 1970 dollar and the 2019 dollar.",what
What is inventory valuation?,"In the U.S. inventory valuation is the dollar amount associated with the items contained in a company's inventory. Initially the amount is the cost of the items defined as all of the costs necessary to get the inventory items in place and ready for sale. (The costs of selling and administration are not included in the cost of inventory.)
Since the inventory items are constantly being sold and restocked and since the costs of the items are constantly changing, a company must select a cost flow assumption. Cost flow assumptions include first-in, first-out; weighted average; and last-in, first out. The company is expected to be consistent in its application of the selected cost flow assumption.
A manufacturer's inventory valuation will include the costs of production, namely direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead. Manufacturers are also required to consistently follow their cost flow assumptions.
Inventory valuation is important in that it affects the cost of goods sold, a significant amount reported on the company's income statement. Inventory is also an important component of a company's current assets, working capital, and current ratio.
If the net realizable value of a company's inventory declines to a value which is less than its cost, the company is usually required to report the inventory at its net realizable value. (Net realizable value is the expected selling price minus the the costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.)",what
What is an intangible asset?,"An intangible asset is an asset that you cannot touch. Examples of intangible assets include  copyrights, patents, mailing lists, trademarks, brand names, domain names, and so on.
Often the market value of an intangible asset is far greater than the market value of a company's tangible assets such as its buildings and equipment.
Accounting principles require that intangible assets be reported on a company's balance sheet at cost or less. Since many intangible assets are not purchased, they may not have a reportable cost. As a result, many valuable intangible assets are not even reported as assets on the company's balance sheet.",what
What are interim financial statements?,"Interim financial statements for a corporation are the financial statements covering a period of less than one year. Often interim financial statements are issued for the quarters between the annual financial statements. The purpose is to give investors and other users updated information on the corporation's operations. Unlike the annual financial statements, the interim financial statements are usually unaudited and condensed. Therefore, it is wise to also read the previously issued and complete annual financial statements and reports.
In order for the interim income statement amounts to add up to the amounts reported in the official income statement for the year, it is necessary that the accounting practices in the interim financial statements be consistent with the accounting practices that will be followed in the annual financial statements.",what
What is the consistency principle?,"Definition of Consistency
In accounting, consistency requires that a company's financial statements follow the same accounting principles, methods, practices and procedures from one accounting period to the next. This allows the readers of the financial statements to make meaningful comparisons between years.
Consistency does allow a company to make a change to a more preferred accounting method. However, the change and its effects must be clearly disclosed for the benefit of the readers of the financial statements.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board refers to consistency as one of the characteristics or qualities that makes accounting information useful.
Example of Consistency
Let's assume that a U.S. corporation uses the FIFO cost flow assumption for valuing its inventory and determining its cost of goods sold. Due to the increasing cost of its materials, it concludes that LIFO will better indicate the company's true profit. In the year of the change from FIFO to LIFO (and in years when comparisons are presented), the company must disclose the break in consistency.",what
What is LIFO?,"Definition of LIFO
LIFO is the acronym for last-in, first-out, which is a cost flow assumption often used by U.S. corporations in moving costs from inventory to the cost of goods sold.
Under LIFO, the most recent costs of products purchased (or manufactured) are the first costs to be removed from inventory and matched with the sales revenues reported on the income statement. This means that the oldest costs remain in inventory.
LIFO became popular due to inflation and the fact the U.S. income tax rules permit corporations (and other businesses) to use LIFO. With LIFO a corporation is able to match its recent, more-inflated costs with its sales thereby reporting less taxable income than would occur using another cost flow assumption. LIFO is justified because matching the latest costs with the latest sales revenues is a better indicator of the corporation's current profitability (as opposed to matching older lower costs with recent sales revenues).
It is important to understand that LIFO is a cost flow assumption and the flow of costs can be different from the flow of the physical units. In other words, under LIFO a corporation can ship its oldest physical units of product first, but can remove from inventory the cost of the most recently purchased items.
Example of LIFO
Assume that a corporation uses LIFO and has three units of a product in its inventory. Due to its supplier raising its prices, the corporation purchased the items at different costs and in the following sequence: $40, $44, and $46. The corporation ships the oldest item (the one purchased for $40) to a customer at a selling price of $60. However, under the LIFO cost flow assumption the company reports its cost of goods sold at $46 (the latest cost) and reports a gross profit of $14. (The costs of $40 and $44 remain in inventory.) 
Had the corporation used FIFO, it would have removed $40 from inventory and matched it with the selling price of $60. The result would have been a gross profit of $20 (instead of $14 using LIFO). As a result, LIFO allowed the corporation to avoid paying income tax on the additional $6.",what
What is the accrual method?,"The accrual method of accounting reports revenues on the income statement when they are earned even if the customer will pay 30 days later. At the time that the revenues are earned the company will credit a revenue account and will debit the asset account Accounts Receivable. (When the customer pays 30 days after the revenues were earned, the company will debit Cash and will credit Accounts Receivable.)
The accrual method of accounting also requires that expenses and losses be reported on the income statement when they occur even if payment will take place 30 days later. For example, if a company has a $15,000 repair done on December 15 and the vendor allows for payment on January 15, the company will report a repair expense and a liability of $15,000 as of December 15. (On January 15 the company will credit Cash and will debit the liability account.)
The accrual method of accounting, which is also known as the accrual basis of accounting, is required for large companies. (The cash method of accounting may be used by individuals and some small companies.) The accrual method and the associated adjusting entries will result in a more complete and accurate reporting of a company's assets, liabilities, equity, and earnings during each accounting period.",what
What is the journal entry to record a one-year subscription for a magazine?,"Ways to Record One-Year Subscriptions
Let's assume that the cost of the one-year subscription for a monthly trade publication is $120. Let's also assume the payment is made at the start of the subscription period, and that your company prepares monthly financial statements.
One way to enter the transaction is to debit the current asset Prepaid Subscriptions for $120 and to credit Cash for $120. At the end of each month an adjusting entry would be prepared to debit Subscriptions Expense for $10 and to credit Prepaid Subscriptions for $10. This approach would obviously match the annual cost to each of the 12 monthly periods benefiting from the subscription. However, this is not practical given the small amount involved.
Thanks to the accounting concept of materiality, accountants can ignore the matching principle when the amount is insignificant in relationship to the company's size. Since no investor or lender would be misled if the entire $120 appeared as an expense in one month and $0 appeared in the other 11 months, the following entry would be more practical: debit Subscriptions Expense for $120 and credit Cash for $120 at the time of entering the invoice into the accounting records.
If an annual trade group membership fee is $6,000 and the amount is significant for the company, the company should record the payment as a prepaid asset and then write a monthly adjusting entry for $500.",what
What is the difference between a land improvement and a leasehold improvement?,"Examples of land improvements include paved parking areas, driveways, fences, outdoor lighting, and so on. Land improvements are recorded separately from land, because land improvements have a limited life and are depreciated. Land is assumed to last indefinitely and will not be depreciated.
Land improvements are recorded in a general ledger asset account entitled Land Improvements. The depreciation of land improvements will result in depreciation expense on the company's income tax return. This will reduce its taxable income and will reduce a profitable company's income tax payments.
An example of a leasehold improvement is the permanent improvement to a building that is being rented under a 10 year lease. For instance, the tenant might construct permanent walls and offices inside of the warehouse that it leases from the owner. The lease will likely state that all improvements to the building will belong to the owner of the building. The amount spent by the tenant to improve the building will be recorded by the tenant in its asset account Leasehold Improvements. Generally, the amount of these leasehold improvements will be depreciated by the tenant over the useful life of the improvements or over the life of the lease, whichever is shorter. The depreciation expense associated with the leasehold improvements will reduce the tenant's taxable income and its income tax payments if the company is profitable.",what
How can working capital be improved?,"Definition of Working Capital
Working capital is defined as the amount by which a company's current assets exceed its current liabilities.
How Working Capital Can be Improved
Some of the ways that working capital can be increased include:

Earning additional profits
Issuing common stock or preferred stock for cash
Borrowing money on a long-term basis
Replacing short-term debt with long-term debt
Selling long-term assets for cash

In addition to increasing working capital, a company can improve its working capital by making certain that its current assets are converted to cash in a timely manner. For example, if a company can better manage its inventory and its accounts receivable, the company's cash and liquidity will increase. This in turn improves the company's working capital. Similarly, if the company can negotiate more favorable credit terms with its suppliers, the company will have the benefit of having a larger cash balance (even though the amount of working capital will not change).",what
What are sales?,"In accounting, sales refers to the revenues earned when a company sells its goods, products, merchandise, etc. (If a company sells one of its noncurrent assets that was used in its business, the amount received is not recorded in its Sales account.)
The amounts recorded at the time of the sales transaction is also known as gross sales since there may be subsequent subtractions for sales returns, sales allowances, and early payment discounts. (Gross sales minus these subtractions results in the amount of net sales.)
Under the accrual basis or accrual method of accounting, goods sold on credit are reported as sales (revenue) when the goods have been transferred to the buyer. Usually this occurs before the seller receives payment from the buyer. The sales on credit are recorded with a debit to Accounts Receivable and a credit to Sales.",what
What is periodicity in accounting?,"In accounting, periodicity means that accountants will assume that a company's complex and ongoing activities can be divided up and reported in annual, quarterly and monthly financial statements. For example, some earth-moving equipment may require two years to manufacture but the activities will be divided up and reported in quarterly financial statements. A similar situation occurs at a company that develops complex digital systems.
Even a company that manufactures small consumer products will have ongoing activities and costs that overlap two years or more. Again, the accountants will assume that the revenues and costs can be assigned or allocated to the appropriate accounting periods. Hence, the accountants will report the company's net income and cash flows for each accounting period (year, quarter, month, etc.) and the company's financial position at the end of each accounting period.
Periodicity is also known as the time period assumption.",what
Why isn't land depreciated?,"Land is not depreciated because land is assumed to have an unlimited useful life.
Other long-lived assets such as land improvements, buildings, furnishings, equipment, etc. have limited useful lives. Therefore, the costs of those assets must be allocated to those limited accounting periods. Since land's life is not limited, there is no need to allocate the cost of land to any accounting periods.",what
What is the entry when a contract is signed?,"Accounting Entry When Signing a Contract
Merely signing a contract does not by itself require a journal entry. In other words, signing a contract for a future transaction does not mean the company is increasing or decreasing an asset or a liability at the time of the signing. Of course, if cash or some other asset is exchanged at the time of the signing, it will have to be recorded.
While a journal entry is not required at the time the contract is signed, significant commitments that are contained in the contract must be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements of the parties to a noncancelable contract.
Examples of No Entry When Signing a Contract
Assume that an electric utility signs a noncancelable contract with a coal company to purchase 100 million tons of coal to be delivered over a one-year period that will begin in three months. On the day the contract is signed, the electric utility does not own any of the coal specified in the contract, nor does it owe for any of the coal, since the coal will not be delivered for at least three months. When the first trainload of coal arrives at the electric utility at least three months later, the utility will record the purchase of only the coal that has arrived and the related account payable.
Likewise, on the day the contract is signed, the coal company does not have a sale of the coal specified in the contract, and it does not have a receivable from the electric utility. Three months later, when the first shipment of coal is delivered to the utility, the coal company will record a sale of the coal and a related account receivable.
If the commitments made by the utility and the coal company are significant, those commitments must be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements of both the utility and the coal company.",what
What is a post-dated check?,"Definition of a Post-dated Check
A post-dated check (or post-dated cheque) is a check written with a future date. In other words, the date that appears on the check is after the date when the check was written. Even with a future date appearing on the check, the check could clear (be paid from) the bank account prior to that date.
Post-dating a check makes sense only if you are certain that the payee will not cash or deposit the check before the date appearing on the check.
Example of a Post-dated Check
To illustrate, let's assume that on May 22 Jim owes a supplier $2,000 for purchases made 40 days ago. Since Jim does not have the money to pay the supplier, he offers to mail the supplier two $1,000 checks: one check dated for June 20 and the other check dated for July 20. 
The supplier agrees to hold the checks and deposit them on the dates shown on the checks. Jim assures the supplier that the checks will be paid by his bank on those dates.
On June 4, when the supplier receives Jim's postdated checks, the supplier should not debit cash nor credit accounts receivable. The reason is that the checks cannot be turned into cash prior to the dates shown on the checks.",what
What is the difference between Rent Receivable and Rent Payable?,"The asset account Rent Receivable is used by the landlord to report the amount of rent that has been earned by the landlord but has not been received from the tenant as of the balance sheet date. The liability account Rent Payable is used by the tenant to report the amount of rent that the tenant owes for rent but has not been paid as of the balance sheet date.
If the rent is to be paid on the first day of each month, and if the rent is paid on time, the landlord will have a zero balance in Rent Receivable. Similarly, the tenant will have a zero balance in Rent Payable. It is only if the tenant falls behind in making the rent payments that amounts will be entered into the Rent Receivable and Rent Payable accounts.",what
What are the notes to the financial statements?,"Definition of Notes to Financial Statements
The notes to the financial statements are a required, integral part of a company's external financial statements. They are required since not all relevant financial information can be communicated through the amounts shown (or not shown) on the face of the financial statements. The notes are also referred to as footnote disclosures.
Generally, the notes are the main method for a company to comply with the full disclosure principle.
Example of Notes to Financial Statements
The first note to the financial statements is usually a summary of the company's significant accounting policies for the use of estimates, revenue recognition, inventories, property and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, fair value measurement, discontinued operations, foreign currency translation, recently issued accounting pronouncements, and others.
The remaining notes contain the details (including schedules of amounts) for items such as inventories, accrued liabilities, income taxes, employee benefit plans, leases, business segment information, fair value measurements, derivative instruments and hedging, stock options, commitments and contingencies, and more. 
Each external financial statement should also include a reference to the notes, such as: The accompanying notes are an integral part of the financial statements.",what
What is the difference between the Cash Flow and Funds Flow statements?,"The cash flow statement, known formally as the Statement of Cash Flows, reports a company's change in cash and cash equivalents from one balance sheet date to another. The cash flow statement classifies the amount of the change according to operating, investing, and financing activities. The cash flow statement has been required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board since 1988, when it issued its Statement No. 95. You can read about the statement of cash flows at www.FASB.org/st.
Prior to 1988, accountants prepared a funds flow statement. Generally, the funds flow statement reported on the change in working capital from one balance sheet date to another.",what
What is long-term debt?,"Definition of Long-term Debt
In accounting, long-term debt generally refers to a company's loans and other liabilities that will not become due within one year of the balance sheet date. (The amount that will be due within one year is reported on the balance sheet as a current liability.)
Example of Long-term Debt
Let's assume that a company has a mortgage loan with a principal balance of $200,000 with 120 monthly payments remaining. The loan payments due in the next 12 months include $12,000 of principal payments. The $200,000 of debt should be reported on the company's balance sheet as follows:

$188,000 as a long-term or noncurrent liability such as noncurrent portion of mortgage loan
$12,000 as a current liability such as current portion of mortgage loan

When the word ""debt"" is used to mean ""liabilities"" (as is done in financial ratios) then other examples will include vehicle loans, bonds payable, capital lease obligations, pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations, and deferred income taxes.
Some long-term debt that will be due within one year can continue to be reported as a noncurrent liability if the company intends to refinance the debt and can prove it will be done within 12 months without reducing its working capital.",what
What is the statement of activities?,"The statement of activities is one of the main financial statements of a nonprofit or not-for-profit organization.
A nonprofit's statement of activities is issued instead of the income statement which is issued by a for-profit business.
The statement of activities focuses on the total organization (as opposed to focusing on funds within the organization) and reports the following:

Revenues such as contributions, program fees, membership dues, grants, investment income, and amounts released from restrictions.
Expenses reported in categories such as major programs, fundraising, and management and general.
The change in net assets resulting from items 1 and 2.

The statement of activities will have multiple columns in order to report the amounts for each of the following classes of net assets: without donor restrictions, with donor restrictions, and total.",what
What is the entry when merchandise has been received but not the vendor's invoice?,"If you received merchandise, but have not received the vendor's invoice by the end of the accounting period, you need to 1) debit Purchases (periodic method) or debit Inventory (perpetual method) for the cost of the goods or merchandise received, and 2) credit Accounts Payable. You also need to include the merchandise in your physical inventory.
When the vendor's invoice is received and processed, be sure to reverse (remove) the above entry.",what
Does collecting a customer's accounts receivable affect net income?,"Collecting accounts receivable that are in a company's accounting records will not affect the company's net income. (Generally speaking, net income is revenues minus expenses.)
Under the accrual basis of accounting, revenues and accounts receivable are recorded when a company sells products or earns fees by providing services on credit. At the point of delivering the goods or services, the company debits Accounts Receivable and credits Sales Revenues or Service Revenues. When an account receivable is collected 30 days later, the asset account Accounts Receivable is reduced and the asset account Cash is increased. No revenue account is involved at the time of collection.
Your question brings to light the difference between a receipt and a revenue. Cash receipts from collecting accounts receivable or from the proceeds of a bank loan are not revenues. Revenues are amounts that companies earn through their operations by selling products or providing services (whether or not cash is received at the time of the sale or service).",what
What are the ways to value inventory?,"Generally, the balance sheet of a U.S. company must value inventory at cost. In other words, a company's inventory is not reported at the sales value. (An exception occurs when a company's inventory consists of readily salable commodities that have quoted market prices.)
Since the costs of products may change during an accounting year, a company must select a cost flow assumption that it will use consistently. For instance, should the oldest cost be removed from inventory when an item is sold? If so, the company will select the cost flow assumption known as first-in, first out (FIFO). In the U.S. an alternative is to remove the period's most recent cost when an item is sold. This is known as last-in, first-out (LIFO). Another option is to use an average method such as the weighted-average method or the moving-average method. Both the LIFO method and the average methods will result in different values depending on whether a company uses the perpetual method or the periodic method. Still another option is to use the specific identification method.
The LIFO cost flow assumption can be achieved by tracking the units in inventory or by using price indexes. When price indexes are used, it is referred to as dollar-value LIFO. (Retailers often use a technique called dollar-value retail LIFO.)
The accountants' concept of conservatism can result in some inventories being valued at less than cost. Hence, an additional method for valuing inventory is the lower of cost or net realizable value. For example, if the net realizable value of a company's inventory has declined to an amount that is less than cost, the company will likely have to reduce its inventory cost. The amount of that adjustment will also reduce the current period's net income.
A company's inventory must be measured and reviewed very carefully as it is an important amount for determining a company's financial position and profitability.",what
What is the difference between unearned revenue and unrecorded revenue?,"In financial accounting, unearned revenue refers to amounts received prior to being earned. For example, if ABC Service Co. receives $24,000 on December 31, 2012 for a one-year service agreement covering January 1 through December 31, 2013, the entire $24,000 is unearned as of December 31, 2012. On the December 31, 2012 balance sheet ABC should report a liability such as Unearned Revenues for $24,000. During 2013 ABC should move $2,000 per month from the liability account on its balance sheet to a revenue account on its income statement.
I associate unrecorded revenue with revenues that were earned, but not yet recorded in a company's accounting records. For example, an electric utility will provide electricity to customers for up to one month before it reads the customers' meters, calculates the bills and records the billings as revenues and accounts receivable. As a result, the electric utility will have up to one month of unrecorded revenue. At each balance sheet date, the utility should accrue for the revenues it earned but had not yet recorded. This is done through an adjusting entry that debits a balance sheet receivable account and credits an income statement revenue account.",what
How do you calculate the payroll accrual?,"The payroll accrual is the amount that needs to be entered into a liability account in order for the credit balance in the liability account to be the amount owed to employees. The amount owed is the amount the employees have earned from working, but as of the date of the balance sheet this amount has not been paid to the employees.
To illustrate the payroll accrual, assume that a company's employees were paid on September 30 for their work through September 25. The credit balance needed in the liability account as of September 30 is the amount that the employees earned for the days of September 26 through September 30.",what
What does it mean to report expenses by function?,"To report expenses by function means to report them according to the activity for which the expenses were incurred.
For a business, the reporting of expenses by function means the income statement will report expenses according to the following functional classifications: manufacturing, selling, general administrative, and financing.
For a not-for-profit organization, the reporting of expenses by function means the statement of activities will report expenses according to the following functional classifications: 1) each of its major programs, and 2) the supporting services which are a) management and general, b) fund-raising, and c) membership development. It will also present the expenses by nature, such as salaries, electricity, repairs, etc.
(Classifying expenses according to salaries, electricity, repairs, etc. is referred to as natural classifications, or classifying expenses by their nature.)",what
What is straight line depreciation?,"Straight line depreciation is likely to be the most common method of matching a plant asset's cost to the accounting periods in which it is in service. Under the straight line method of depreciation, each full accounting year will be allocated the same amount or percentage of an asset's cost. (The total amount of depreciation over the years of the asset's useful life will be the asset's cost minus any expected or assumed salvage value.)
To illustrate straight line depreciation let's assume that a company purchases equipment at a cost of $430,000 and it is expected to be used in the business for 10 years. At the end of the 10 years, the company expects to receive a salvage value of $30,000. Under the straight line method each full accounting year will be allocated $40,000 of depreciation, which is one-tenth (1/10) or 10% of the $400,000 that needs to be depreciated over the useful life of the equipment. If the asset is purchased in the middle of the accounting year there will be $20,000 of depreciation in the first and the eleventh accounting year and $40,000 in each of the years 2 through 10.
In the U.S. a company may use the straight line method for its financial statements while at the same time be using the Internal Revenue Service's faster depreciation on its federal income tax return.",what
What is meant by the term relevance in accounting?,"In accounting, the term relevance means it will make a difference to a decision maker.
For example, in the decision to replace equipment that has been used for the past six years, the original cost of the equipment does not have relevance. In other words, the original cost is irrelevant or is not relevant in the decision to replace the equipment. What will have relevance are the future amounts, such as the cost of the new equipment, and the savings that will occur when the old equipment is replaced.
Here's another expression of relevance: Costs that will differ among alternatives. Costs that will not differ among alternatives do not have relevance.
In order to have relevance, accounting information must be timely. Financial statements issued three weeks after the accounting period ends will have more relevance than financial statements issued several months after the period ends. Having timeliness and relevance may mean sacrificing some precision or reliability.
Read more about relevance in paragraphs 46-57 of the Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No. 2, Qualitative Characteristics of Accounting Information, issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. You may read it at no cost at www.FASB.org.",what
Why would Prepaid Insurance have a credit balance?,"Several situations could cause a credit balance in the asset account Prepaid Insurance. For example, let's assume a company's insurance has a cost of $600 every six months. As a result, the company decides to debit Prepaid Insurance when the amount is paid semiannually. It also prepares an automatic monthly adjusting entry to debit Insurance Expense $100 and to credit Prepaid Insurance for $100. If one of the $600 payments is debited to Insurance Expense (or another account) instead of Prepaid Insurance, the monthly adjusting entries will cause the balance in the Prepaid Insurance account to become a credit balance.
Another possibility is that the company simply failed to pay the insurance company and the monthly adjusting entries caused the balance in Prepaid Insurance to become a credit balance. Whatever the cause of the credit balance in Prepaid Insurance, the account balance needs to be adjusted before issuing a balance sheet. The Prepaid Insurance account must report the true amount that is prepaid (paid but not yet expired) as of the date of the balance sheet. If nothing is prepaid then the Prepaid Insurance account must show a zero balance. If an amount is owed to the insurance company, there should be a liability account with a credit balance for the amount owed as of the balance sheet date.
Because adjusting entries involve a balance sheet account and an income statement account, it is wise to also look at the amount being reported in the income statement account Insurance Expense. You should monitor both the Insurance Expense account balance and the Prepaid Insurance account balance throughout the year. The amount paid to the insurance company that has expired needs to be reported as an expense and the amount that has not yet expired needs to be reported as the asset Prepaid Insurance.",what
Where does accrued interest on notes receivable get reported on the balance sheet?,"Accrued interest on notes receivable is likely to be reported as a current asset such as Accrued Interest Receivable or Interest Receivable. The accrued interest receivable is a current asset if the interest amount is expected to be collected within one year of the balance sheet date.
I would expect that even a long-term note receivable that is due in five years will require that the interest on the note be paid quarterly, semiannually or annually. Hence the accrued interest will be a current asset.
If the interest on the note is not expected to be received within one year of the balance sheet date, then the accrued interest receivable should be reported as a long-term asset.",what
"What is the advantage of using historical cost on the balance sheet for property, plant and equipment?","The main advantage of using historical cost on the balance sheet for property, plant and equipment is that historical cost can be verified. Generally, the cost at the time of purchase is documented with contracts, invoices, payments, transfer taxes, and so on.
The historical cost of plant and equipment (not land) is also used to determine the amount of depreciation expense reported on the income statement. The accumulated amount of depreciation is also reported as a deduction from the assets' historical costs reported on the balance sheet. (In the case of impairment, some assets might be reported at less than the amounts based on historical cost.)
The use of historical cost is also a disadvantage to those users of the financial statements who want to know the current values.",what
Does paying an account payable affect net income?,"Paying accounts payable that are already included in a company's accounting records will not affect the company's net income. (Generally speaking, net income is revenues minus expenses.)
Under the accrual basis of accounting, if an expense is associated with an accounts payable, the expense will be recorded at the time the accounts payable is recorded—not at the time of the payment. For example, on January 2 a company has its office copier repaired. The cost of the repair is $300 and is to be paid by January 31. On January 2, the invoice for the repair is recorded with a $300 debit to Repairs and Maintenance Expense–Office Equipment and a $300 credit to Accounts Payable. On January 31 when the invoice is paid, the company will debit Accounts Payable and will credit Cash for $300. As you see, the January 31 transaction affects two balance sheet accounts; no expense account or other income statement account is involved.
The January 31 transaction also illustrates that an expenditure is not necessarily an expense. Here are two additional examples: (1) A company pays cash to purchase an asset that will be used in the business. At the time of the purchase, an expenditure takes place, but not an expense. The expense will occur later when the asset is depreciated. (2) A company repays $50,000 of principal owed on its bank loan. The $50,000 is an expenditure, but it is not an expense.
Expenses are costs that are used up in order for the company to earn revenues. Expenses are also costs that expired during an accounting period. Under accrual accounting, expenses can occur before or after a cash expenditure is made.",what
Should trademarks be included on the balance sheet?,"A trademark should be reported on the balance sheet as an intangible asset. However, the cost principle prevents the reported amount from being more than the cost of acquiring and defending the trademark. A trademark that was developed internally (rather than purchased) might have a cost of $0, and therefore it will not be listed on the balance sheet.
For example, Company X, a consumer products company, introduced a new product in 1960. It registered the trademark in 1960 for a small fee that was immediately expensed. Since then Company X has been very effective in promoting this trademarked brand. Consumers now pay a premium price for this recognized and superior product. A competitor offers to purchase the trademark from Company X for $300 million in cash. If Company X does not sell the trademark, Company X will not list the trademark as an asset. (Recall that the trademark's cost was $0.)
If Company X were to sell the trademark to Company Y for $300 million, Company Y will report the trademark on its balance sheet at $300 million. The reason is that there was a transaction for $300 million and Company Y's cost of the trademark was indeed $300 million.",what
What is the difference between expenses and payments?,"Under the accrual method of accounting, expenses are costs that have been used up or have been incurred in the process of earning revenues and/or operating a business. For example, a retailer will report its cost of the goods sold as an expense of the period in which the related sales occurred (even if the retailer has not yet paid for the goods, or had paid for the goods in an earlier period). Some expenses are allocations of a cost that was paid in an earlier period (e.g. depreciation of an asset purchased in a previous year, the allocation of a 6-month insurance premium). Expenses also include costs incurred in the current period that will be paid in a later period (e.g. current advertising that will be paid for in the next accounting period). Interest on a loan is a daily expense even though all of the interest will be paid when the loan comes due in the next accounting period.
A payment is a disbursement of money (usually in the form of a check or currency). Some payments are current period expenses (e.g. current month's rent payment) but many payments are not expenses of the current period. Here are a few examples of payments that are not expenses:

a payment of $100,000 to purchase the land adjacent to a company will never become an expense
payments that are cash dividends to stockholders will never be a corporation's expense
principal payments to reduce a loan payable will never be an expense
payments to remit payroll tax withholdings will never be an expense
payments to reduce liabilities resulting from expenses reported in earlier accounting periods (e.g. payments to reduce interest payable, accounts payable, taxes payable)

Some current period payments will result in expenses in future periods:

payments for construction of a building that will be put into service next year
payments for an exhibit at next year's trade show
payments for services to be received in a future accounting period",what
Why are the amounts on the financial statements rounded to thousands or millions?,"Amounts on financial statements are often rounded in order to emphasize the important digits. As a result of rounding, the financial statements are more attractive in appearance which in turn makes them more inviting to read.
Rounding is important because corporations must present three years of figures on their income statements and cash flow statements and two years of figures on the balance sheet. For example, imagine looking at the income statement with the following sales amounts over the past three years: $1,512,989.63 $1,321,026.98 $1,265,876.22. Now look at the amounts rounded to the nearest thousand: $1,513 $1,321 $1,266. The rounded figures allow you to focus on the relevant digits. The rounded amounts also makes it easier for us to see the trend. Of course, you must label the financial statement with words such as ""Amounts rounded to 000's"" so that the reader understands the amounts shown.
Rounding of the less important digits is acceptable because of accountants' materiality principle  or guideline. The rounding is acceptable so long as the rounded amounts will not mislead a current or potential investor, lender, or other person making a decision from the reported information.",what
Why do we charge depreciation?,"We charge depreciation because most of the long-lived assets used in a business have 1) a significant cost, and 2) they will be useful only for a limited number of years. The matching principle (a basic underlying accounting principle) requires that the actual cost of these assets be allocated to the accounting periods in which the company will benefit from their use.
The depreciation reported on a U.S. corporation's external financial statements is computed by spreading an asset's cost (less any salvage value) over the asset's service life or useful life. For example, equipment with a cost of $500,000 and no salvage value at the end of an assumed useful life of 10 years will likely result in matching $50,000 to each full accounting year. (The U.S. income tax rules allow accelerating the depreciation amounts, but the total cannot exceed the asset's cost.)
Examples of the assets that must be depreciated include machinery, equipment, fixtures, furnishings, buildings, vehicles, etc. These assets are often referred to as fixed assets or plant assets, and the amounts spent are part of a corporation's capital expenditures. (Note that land is not depreciated because it is assumed to last indefinitely.)",what
Why do purchases appear as expenses on an income statement?,"Generally, the purchases of merchandise are sold in the year they are acquired. Hence, it is logical to match the current period's purchases as expenses on the same income statement that reports the current period's sales revenues.
If some of the purchases are not sold in the same period, there will be a change in inventory. An increase in the amount of inventory will appear on the income statement as a deduction to the current period's purchases. It is a deduction because some of the costs of the current period's purchases are not associated with the sales shown on the income statement. The deduction is reporting that some of the costs of purchases are being deferred to a later period when they will be sold. The deduction is necessary in order to achieve the matching principle: matching the proper amount of the costs of the goods sold with the sales revenues of the accounting period.
A decrease in the amount of inventory will appear on the income statement as an addition to the cost of the purchases. This recognizes that some of the sales included some costs of purchases that were made in an earlier accounting period.",what
What is the accounting entry when an order is received?,"There is no accounting entry recorded in a company's general ledger accounts when an order is received.
The reason is that a sale or sales revenues has not yet occurred, nor does the company have an accounts receivable at this point. Generally, the sale and the related receivable occur when the goods are shipped (FOB shipping point) or when the goods are received by the customer (FOB destination).
While there is no accounting entry in the general ledger, it is likely that the company will create a record outside of the general ledger to track the order and to schedule various activities that will be needed to ship the products to the customer.",what
What is income smoothing?,"Income smoothing refers to reducing the fluctuations in a corporation's earnings. Income smoothing can range from good business methods to fraudulent reporting.
Some business practices are ethical and will result in income smoothing. For example, a corporation might have an employee bonus plan, a deferred profit sharing plan, and a charitable giving plan that will result in expenses that total 25% of its pretax profits. In addition, a U.S. corporation might have a combined federal and state income tax rate of 40% on its incremental pretax profits. These examples will smooth income by causing huge expenses when profits are huge, and will result in little expense when profits are little. (Losses could actually result in a negative income tax expense.) In a year of low profits a corporation might eliminate jobs and postpone maintenance expenses. When profits are higher the corporation will add jobs and perform the maintenance that it had avoided.
The term income smoothing is more likely associated with the manipulation of earnings, creative accounting and the aggressive interpretation and application of generally accepted accounting principles. Perhaps a company will increase its allowance for doubtful accounts with a significant charge to bad debts expense in the years with high profits. Then in years of low profits, the company will reduce the allowance for doubtful accounts. Perhaps a U.S. manufacturer using LIFO will deliberately reduce its inventory quantities in low profit years in order to liquidate the old LIFO layers containing low unit costs. Other manufacturers might increase production when sales and profits are low in order to have lower unit costs.
Smoothing income by abusing the leeway in accounting principles is unethical and does a disservice to the users of the financial statements. Accountants should follow their general guidelines such as consistency, comparability, neutrality, full disclosure and conservatism.",what
How do you account for bond issue costs?,"The costs associated with issuing bonds should be recorded in a contra liability account such as Bond Issue Costs. Over the life of the bonds you will need to systematically move the bond issue cost from the balance sheet to the income statement. Accountants refer to this as amortizing the costs.
Let's illustrate the amortization of bond issue costs by assuming the total of the bond issue costs were $24,000 and the bonds will mature in 10 years. Each month you would debit Interest Expense for $200 ($24,000 divided by 120 months) and would credit Bond Issue Costs for $200. The concept is to match the $24,000 cost to the accounting periods that are benefiting from the bonds having been issued.
Our discussion pertains to financial statement reporting and we are not familiar with income tax reporting. You should discuss the income tax treatment with your tax adviser.",what
Should inventories be reported at their cost or at their selling prices?,"Generally inventories are reported at their cost. A merchant's inventory would be reported at the merchant's cost to purchase the items. A manufacturer's inventory would be at its cost to produce the items (the cost of direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead).
However, if the net realizable value (NRV) of the inventory is less than the cost, the NRV will usually need to be reported on the balance sheet instead of the cost. Net realizable value is defined as the expected selling price in the ordinary course of business minus any costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. When the cost of the inventory is written down to its NRV, the amount of the write down is reported on the income statement. (In a few industries, such as gold mining and meatpacking, it is accepted practice to report the inventory at its net realizable value.)
Since the unit cost of items in inventory is likely to be changing (think inflation), the costs used for inventory reporting will be based on a cost flow assumption. For example, the FIFO cost flow assumption will result in the inventory being reported at the more recent costs, since the first costs are assumed to have been the first costs out of inventory. Under the LIFO cost flow assumption, the inventory will be valued at the older costs, since the more recent costs are assumed to be the first costs to flow out of inventory.",what
What are the limitations of the balance sheet?,"One limitation of the balance sheet is that only the assets acquired in transactions can be included. Therefore, some of a company's most valuable assets will not be reported on the balance sheet. For example, assume that a company developed an internet business that now attracts millions of visitors each day and has $10 million in annual revenues. Since the internet business was not purchased from another company and its cost to develop was not significant, the company's balance sheet will include the business's cash, receivables and some related payables. However, the company's balance sheet will not be reporting the internet business at anywhere near the $30 million that the company was offered for the internet business.
Similarly, the immensely talented designers and content writers employed by an internet business cannot be reported as assets on the company's balance sheet since they were not acquired (and accountants are not able to compute a precise amount for these human resources). This is also the case for a company's reputation, its brand names that were developed through years of effective marketing, its customers' future demand for its unique services, etc.
Another limitation of the balance sheet pertains to a company's long-term (or noncurrent) assets which have increased in value since the time they were purchased in a transaction. For instance, a company's land will be reported at an amount no greater than its cost (due to the accountant's cost principle). Its buildings will be reported at their cost minus their accumulated depreciation (due to the cost principle and the matching principle). Hence, the amounts reported on the balance sheet for a company's land and buildings could be much lower than their market value.",what
Are bonds payable reported as a current liability if they mature in six months?,"Bonds payable that mature (or come due) within one year of the balance sheet date will be reported as a current liability if the issuer of the bonds must use a current asset or will create a current liability in order to pay the bondholders when the bonds mature.
However, the bonds could be reported as a long-term liability right up to the maturity date if:

The company has a sufficient, long-term investment that is restricted for the purpose of paying the bondholders when the bonds mature. This type of investment is known as a bond sinking fund.
The company has a binding agreement that guarantees that the existing bonds will be refinanced by issuing new bonds or by issuing shares of stock.",what
How much do you depreciate an asset and when?,"Depreciation begins when you place an asset in service and it ends when you take an asset out of service or when you have expensed its cost, whichever comes first.
For financial statements, you are guided by the matching principle. The objective is to match the cost of the asset to the accounting periods in which revenues were earned by using the asset. There are two estimates needed: 1) the number of years that the asset will be used, and 2) the salvage value at the end of the asset's use. If an asset has a cost of $100,000 and is expected to be used for 10 years and then have no salvage value, most companies will depreciate the asset at the rate of $10,000 per year. This is known as the straight line method of depreciation.
For income tax purposes in the U.S., the Internal Revenue Service has determined the number of years that various assets will be useful and it assumes there will be no salvage value. The IRS also allows companies to take larger depreciation deductions in the earlier years and smaller deductions in the later years of the assets' lives. This is known as accelerated depreciation.
As you probably noted from the above information, in any one year the depreciation expense on the financial statements will be different from the depreciation expense on the income tax return. However, over the life of an asset, the total depreciation expense will be the same. Accountants refer to this as a timing difference.",what
What is the allowance method?,"Definition of Allowance Method
The allowance method usually refers to one of the two ways for reporting bad debts expense that results from a company selling goods or services on credit. (The other way is the direct write-off method.)
Under the allowance method, a company records an adjusting entry at the end of each accounting period for the amount of the losses it anticipates as the result of extending credit to its customers. The entry will involve the operating expense account Bad Debts Expense and the contra-asset account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. Later, when a specific account receivable is actually written off as uncollectible, the company debits Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and credits Accounts Receivable.
The allowance method is preferred over the direct write-off method because:

The income statement will report the bad debts expense closer to the time of the sale or service, and
The balance sheet will report a more realistic net amount of accounts receivable that will actually be turning to cash

The allowance method can be applied in one or both of the following ways:

Focusing on the bad debts expense that is needed on the income statement
Focusing on the balance needed in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts (which will be reported on the balance sheet)

Examples of Allowance Method
Let's assume that a corporation begins operations on November 1 in an industry where it is common to give credit terms of net 30 days. In this industry approximately 0.3% of credit sales will not be collected.
Next, let's assume that the corporation focuses on the bad debts expense. If the corporation's actual credit sales for November are $800,000 it will record an adjusting entry dated November 30 to debit Bad Debts Expense for $2,400 ($800,000 X 0.003) and credit Allowance for Doubtful Accounts for $2,400. As a result, its November income statement will be matching $2,400 of bad debts expense with the credit sales of $800,000. If the balance in Accounts Receivable is $800,000 as of November 30, the corporation will report Accounts Receivable (net) of $797,600.
Focusing on the balance in the account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, the corporation will adjust the balance in the account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts so that the combination of that credit balance and the debit balance in Accounts Receivable will be equal to the amount that is expected to turn to cash. The expected amount will likely be determined by aging the accounts receivable.
If the corporation prepares weekly financial statements, it might focus on the bad debts expense for its weekly financial statements, but at the end of each quarter focus on the allowance account.",what
Why is the distinction between product costs and period costs important?,"The distinction between product costs and period costs is important to:

Properly measure a company's net income during the time specified on its income statement, and
To report the proper cost of inventory on the balance sheet

Definition of Product Costs
Product costs include the costs to manufacture products or to purchase products. If a product is unsold, the product costs will be reported as inventory on the balance sheet. When the product is sold, its cost is removed from inventory and will be included on the income statement as the cost of goods sold. Product costs are also referred to as inventoriable costs.
Examples of Product Costs
The product costs for a retailer will be the amount paid to the supplier plus any freight-in. Product costs for a manufacturer will be the direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead used to manufacture a product.
Definition of Period Costs
Period costs are expenses that will be reported on the income statement without ever attaching to products. Since they are not product costs, period costs will not be included in the cost of inventory. Instead, period costs will be referred to as period expenses since they will be reported on the income statement as selling, general and administrative (SG&A) or interest expenses.
Example of Period Costs
Selling expenses (such as commissions, salaries of sales employees, advertising), general and administrative (general office salaries, rent, utilities, etc.), and interest expense will be reported on the income statement when they are directly related to sales or when they are used up. For example, the insurance premiums that a company pays for nonmanufacturing protection will be expensed in the period in which the insurance premiums expire. (However, the insurance premiums for the manufacturing operations will become part of the product costs as the insurance premiums expire.)",what
Why does commitment and contingencies appear on the balance sheet without an amount?,"The term or caption commitment and contingencies appears near the end of a balance sheet without an amount in order to direct a reader's attention to the disclosures included in the notes to the financial statements.
An amount is not shown for a variety of reasons. For example, a chain of retail stores may have signed five-year, noncancelable leases to rent retail space for $1 million per year. This commitment needs to be disclosed to the readers of the balance sheet. However, if none of the $5 million is actually due as of the balance sheet date, there is no liability amount to be recorded in a liability account.
Another example of a commitment is an electric utility which has signed a noncancelable contract to purchase 100 million tons of coal during the following 10 years. This commitment also needs to be disclosed to the readers of the balance sheet. However, if none of the coal has been delivered as of the balance sheet date, the utility company will not report a liability since nothing is due as of the balance sheet date.
There are also some loss contingencies which are not recorded with amounts in the general ledger, but must be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. You can learn more about these contingencies by using the search box on AccountingCoach.com.",what
How does the purchase of a new machine affect the profit and loss statement?,"The purchase of a new machine that will be used in a business will affect the profit and loss statement, or income statement, when the machine is placed into service. At that point, depreciation expense will begin and there will likely be other expenses such as wages, maintenance, electricity, and so on.
Since the income statement reports only the expenses that match the revenues during the accounting period, the depreciation expense might be very small in the first accounting period compared to the amount spent for the machine. For example, if the machine is purchased half way into the accounting year and its cost was $300,000, the depreciation for that first accounting period might be only $15,000—assuming it has a 10 year life and no salvage value. In the next accounting period the depreciation expense will be $30,000 under the straight-line method.
If the machine is used by a manufacturer, the depreciation, electricity, and maintenance of the machine will be recorded as manufacturing overhead. This overhead is then assigned to the products and will be held in inventory until the goods are sold. When the products are sold, these overhead costs will be reported on the income statement as part of the cost of goods sold.",what
Why would a company use double-declining depreciation on its financial statements?,"Most companies will not use the double-declining balance method of depreciation on their financial statements. The reason is that it causes the company's net income in the early years of an asset's life to be lower than it would be under the straight-line method.
One reason for using double-declining balance depreciation on the financial statements is to have a consistent combination of depreciation expense and repairs and maintenance expense during the life of the asset. In other words, in the early years of the asset's life, when the repairs and maintenance expenses are low, the depreciation expense will be high. In the later years of the asset's life, when the repairs and maintenance expenses are high, the depreciation expense will be low. While this seems logical, the company will end up reporting lower net income in the early years of the asset's life (as compared to the use of straight-line depreciation). Most managers will not accept reporting lower net income sooner than required.",what
What is the difference between the terms capitalize and depreciate?,"Capitalize refers to adding an amount to the balance sheet. For example, certain interest from loans to self-construct a building will be added to the cost of the building. The building's cost including the capitalized interest will be recorded as an asset on the balance sheet.
Depreciate refers to reducing an amount reported on the balance sheet. Depreciation is defined as systematically allocating the cost of a plant asset from the balance sheet and reporting it as depreciation expense on the income statement. If the building has a cost of $600,000 and a useful life of 30 years, then (assuming no salvage value and straight-line depreciation) each year $20,000 of cost is removed from the asset section of the balance sheet and will appear on the income statement as depreciation expense. (This in turn reduces owner's equity and keeps the balance sheet in balance.)
The interest on debt that is capitalized will not be expensed during the year of construction. Instead, it is added to the cost of the building (capitalized) and will be part of the annual depreciation expense occurring during the building's 30-year life.
In summary, capitalize means to add an amount to the balance sheet. Depreciate means to systematically remove an amount from the balance sheet during the asset's useful life.",what
What is the difference between a note payable and a bond payable?,"For accounting purposes, a note payable and a bond payable are similar. That is, both are 1) written promises to pay interest and to repay the principal amount or maturity amount on specified future dates, 2) both are reported as liabilities, and 3) interest is accrued as a current liability.
If the bond or the note has its principal or maturity due within one year of the balance sheet date and the payment will cause a reduction in working capital, the bond or note will be reported as a current liability. If the bond or note will not be due within one year of the balance sheet date or if the maturity date is within one year but will not cause a reduction in working capital when it becomes due, it will be reported as a long-term liability. (For example, there may be a bond sinking fund or a formal agreement for refinancing the debt with new long-term debt or stock.)
Outside of accounting, I am certain there are differences. For example, debt with an original maturity date of less than a year is likely to be a note. However, some notes can be longer than one year. Government debt securities might be bills, notes, or bonds depending on the original maturity date of the debt security. Perhaps some notes do not specify interest.",what
Which financial statement tells the value of a business?,"None of the financial statements will report the value of a business. The main financial statements (balance sheet, income statement, statement of cash flows, statement of stockholders' equity) may provide some helpful partial information, but they will not report the value of the business.
Two reasons why the value of a business is not included in the financial statements are:

The financial statements are generally based on the company's past recorded transactions. The value of the business will more likely be based on the perceived future transactions.
The accountants' cost principle prohibits a business from reporting some highly-valued assets such as trademarks, brand names, and an effective management team (assuming these were developed internally).

A contemporary example which demonstrates that the financial statements do not reflect the value of a business is a startup company with a promising future. We may have read that a venture capitalist (VC) invested $10 million in a startup. Based on that investment the startup is assumed to have a total value of $100 million. Well the startup's financial statements will not report amounts anywhere near $100 million. Realistically the financial statements will be reporting negative earnings, few assets and little stockholders' equity. The company's value came from the VC's perception of the company's new breakthrough system that is projected to generate amazing future revenues with a limited amount of expenses.
In short, the financial statements provide only some of the information needed when attempting to determine the value of a business.",what
Why does our company's balance sheet report its land at cost when it is so much more valuable?,"Accountants are guided by the cost principle. This requires accountants to report assets at their cost when acquired—not their replacement cost or market value. The historical cost is an objective amount that can easily be audited. In contrast, the market value is subjective: one person thinks the land is worth $1 million while another thinks it's worth $1.5 million.
Further support for the cost principle is the accountants' going concern assumption. A company is assumed to be continuing in business and will not be liquidating. If your company bought the land for possible expansion, its cost is more relevant than the amount the company could get if it were liquidating. After all your company is not liquidating. The revenue recognition principle would be another reason why market values are not reported.
(P.S. I should add that some businesses are required to report assets at market value. I believe those businesses are in industries with significant markets and verifiable quoted market prices.)",what
What does it mean to rotate stock?,"To rotate stock means to arrange the oldest units in inventory so they are sold before the newer units. For example, a grocery store will restock its shelves by putting the oldest units in the front part of the shelves. The newest units will be placed in the back of the shelves. The hope is that the customer will select the most convenient (older) units from the front of the shelf.
It is important to rotate stock in all areas: retail display area, warehouse, factory, etc. The reason to rotate stock is to reduce the losses from deterioration and obsolescence.
Ideally, when a company rotates its stock the units are physically flowing first-in, first-out (FIFO). However, in the accounting for the cost of inventory and the cost of the goods sold, the company may use a cost flow assumption which is different from the flow of the physical units. For example, a U.S. company may use the last-in, first-out (LIFO) cost flow assumption even though it diligently rotates its stock of goods.",what
What is depletion?,"Depletion is the movement of the cost of natural resources from a company's balance sheet to its income statements. The objective is to match on the income statement the cost of the natural resources that were sold with the revenues of the natural resources that were sold. The cost of the natural resources sold is referred to as depletion expense.
Conceptually, depletion is similar to the depreciation of property, plant and equipment.",what
When do you adjust the amount of prepaid expenses?,"The balance in the current asset account Prepaid Expenses should be adjusted prior to issuing a company's financial statements. If the company issues financial statements for each calendar month, you will need to adjust the balance in Prepaid Expenses as of the end of each month. If your company issues only quarterly financial statements, you will need to adjust the balance at the end of each quarter.
The goal is to have the balance in Prepaid Expenses be equal to the amount of the unexpired costs as of the end of the accounting period (which is also the date appearing in the heading of the balance sheet).
Usually the adjusting entry for prepaid expenses will be a credit to Prepaid Expenses and a debit to the appropriate expense account(s). For instance, if Prepaid Expenses involve the prepayment of insurance premiums the adjusting entry will include a debit to Insurance Expense.",what
Why is interest expense a nonoperating expense?,"Interest expense is a nonoperating expense when it is not part of a company's main operations. For example, a retailer's main operations are the purchasing and sale of merchandise, and a manufacturer's main operations are the production and sale of goods.  Neither the retailer nor the manufacturer has as its main operations the borrowing and lending of money. (On the other hand, a bank's main operations involves interest expense on its depositors' savings accounts and interest revenues on its loans and bond investments.)
By reporting interest expense as a nonoperating expense, it also allows for a better comparison between the operating income of a retailer that has little debt with a retailer that has a significant amount of debt.",what
What is meant by events after the balance sheet date?,"Events after the balance sheet date are significant financial events that occur after the date of the balance sheet, but prior to the date that the financial statements are issued. For example, a company's balance sheet that has the heading of December 31, 2012 might not be finalized and distributed until February 1, 2013. During January new information may arise that has financial significance. Perhaps there is an event that provides more information about the conditions actually existing on December 31. The second type of event would be a new January event that does not change the December 31 amounts, but needs to be disclosed to the readers of the December 31 financial statements.
An example of the first situation might be that a customer owes Jay Company $200,000 on December 31 and Jay Company assumed that the customer was financially sound. As a result Jay Company did not provide any allowance for the customer's account being uncollectible. Then on January 28, the customer filed for bankruptcy and Jay Company learns that none of the $200,000 receivable will be collected. If the customer's financial condition on December 31 was already in bankruptcy condition, Jay Company will need to adjust its December 31 balance sheet and its income statement for the year 2012 for this $200,000 of bad debts expense.
An example of the second situation might be a loss arising from a catastrophe occurring on January 16, 2013. The amounts reported as of December 31, 2012 will not be adjusted since those amounts were correct as of December 31. However, the readers of the December 31 balance sheet and the 2012 income statement should be informed through a disclosure that something significant has occurred to the company's financial position since December 31.
The events after the balance sheet date are often referred to as subsequent events or post balance sheet events.",what
What is the time value of money?,"Definition of Time Value of Money
The time value of money recognizes that receiving cash today is more valuable than receiving cash in the future. The reason is that the cash received today can be invested immediately and begin growing in value. For instance, if a company receives $1,000 today and is able to invest the amount immediately at a rate of 10% per year, the company will have $1,100 after 365 days.
If the time value of money is 10%, it also means that receiving $1,100 in one year is comparable to receiving $1,000 today. Accountants will state that the future value of $1,100 has a present value of $1,000. The difference of $100 will become interest income as over the 365 days that the company waits for the cash.
Time Value of Money | Practical Example
Let's assume that a company provides consulting services today and agrees to an $11,000 payment one year later. The $11,000 represents:

an amount for the services performed today, and
interest to compensate the company for waiting 365 days for the $11,000

Under the accrual basis of accounting and a time value of money of 10%, the service revenues that were earned today are $10,000. The difference of $1,000 will be reported as interest income over the 365 days that the company waits for the $11,000.
Importance of the Time Value of Money in Accounting
The time value of money is important in accounting because of the accountant's cost principle and revenue recognition principle. However, the concepts of materiality and cost/benefit allow the accountants to ignore the time value of money for the routine accounts receivable and accounts payable having credit terms of 30 or 60 days.",what
Where can I find the amount of income taxes paid by a corporation?,"You can find the amount of income taxes paid by a corporation by reading its statement of cash flows and its notes to the financial statements.
US GAAP requires corporations to report the amount of income taxes paid. The AICPA's Accounting Trend and Techniques indicates that approximately half of the 500 large corporations that it surveyed had reported the amount of income taxes paid at the bottom of the statement of cash flows. Almost the same number had reported the amount of income taxes paid in its notes to the financial statements. Only 5 or 6 corporations had reported the amount within its statement of cash flows. For U.S. corporations whose stock is publicly-traded, you will find the statement of cash flows included in its Form 10-K, which is the annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
It is important to understand that the income tax provision reported on the income statement is not the amount of income taxes paid in that period.",what
What is a lien?,"A lien is a legal document filed by a creditor (lender) in order to record its claim on the debtor's (borrower's) property. The lien is recorded at a government's office. The lien provides a creditor with some protection or collateral until the debtor pays the creditor the amount owed.
Here are three examples of liens:

A bank may lend a retailer $50,000 but one of the conditions is that the bank will file a lien on the retailer's inventory. In this situation the bank's lien results in its loan becoming secured.
A mortgage is a lien filed by a lender in order to secure the lender's long-term real estate loan. The lien will require that the lender be paid the amount owed on the loan before the real estate can be transferred to another party.
The U.S. government may file a lien on a company's assets until a tax obligation has been paid.

A lien on a company's assets is to be disclosed in the company's financial statements.",what
Is standard costing GAAP?,"Standard costing was developed to assist a manufacturer plan and control its operations. Generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP require that a manufacturer's financial statements comply with the cost principle. This means that the inventories, the cost of goods sold, and the resulting net income must reflect the manufacturer's actual costs.
Standard costing will meet the GAAP requirements if the variances between the standard costs and the actual costs are properly prorated to the inventories and to the cost of goods sold prior to issuing the financial statements.",what
What are accrual adjusting entries?,"Definition of Accrual Adjusting Entries
Accrual adjusting entries or simply accruals are one of three types of adjusting entries which are prepared at the end of an accounting period so that a company's financial statements will comply with the accrual method of accounting. Expressed another way, accrual adjusting entries are the means for including transactions that occurred during the current accounting period but have not yet been recorded in a company's general ledger accounts. Without accrual adjusting entries those transactions will likely be reported in a later accounting period. This means that the financial statements for two accounting periods will be reporting incorrect amounts.
Example of an Accrual Adjusting Entry for Expenses
To illustrate, let's assume that New Corp begins its business on December 1 and uses Sales Rep Company for calling on customers. For this service, New Corp agrees to pay commissions of 5% of sales with payment made 10 days after the month ends. Assuming that December's sales are $100,000 New Corp will be incurring commissions expense of $5,000 and a liability of $5,000. However, the payment will actually occur on January 10. Without an accrual adjusting entry as of December 31 New Corp's financial statements will have the following problems:

Its December income statement will report $0 commissions expense in getting December's sales of $100,000
Its January income statement will report $5,000 in commissions expense that were actually incurred in order to get December's sales
Its December 31 balance sheet will not be reporting its $5,000 liability to Sales Rep Company

In order for New Corp's December's income statement to match the $5,000 of commissions expense with December's sales of $100,000, and for New Corp's December 31 balance sheet to report the liability of $5,000, the following accrual adjusting entry is needed as of December 31: debit Commissions Expense for $5,000; credit Commissions Payable for $5,000.
Example of an Accrual Adjusting Entry for Revenues
Over at Sales Rep Company, for its financial statements to comply with the accrual method of accounting it needs to record the following accrual adjusting entry as of December 31 (assuming its billing will take place in early January): debit the asset account Commissions Receivable for $5,000; credit Commissions Revenues for $5,000. Without this accrual entry as of December 31, Sales Rep Company's December financial statements will have the following problems:

Its December income statement will report $0 in revenues that were earned from representing New Corp during December
Its January income statement will report $5,000 in revenues that were actually earned in December when Sales Rep Company was incurring expenses in order to make the sales calls
Its December 31 balance sheet will not be reporting the receivable of $5,000 that it has a right to receive for its December's efforts

Since accrual adjusting entries will be followed by the actual transactions (checks written, billing invoices issued, etc.), a helpful accounting procedure is to record reversing entries on the first day of the next accounting period.",what
At what point are revenues considered to be earned?,"Revenues, which are derived from an entity's main activities such as the sale of merchandise or the performance of service, are considered to be earned when the earning process has been substantially completed.
For example, a merchandiser's sales revenues are considered earned when the goods have been shipped or delivered to the customers and the merchandiser has a right to a collectible accounts receivable. (Under accrual accounting it is not necessary to have received the cash in order to have earned the revenues.) The reason is that the substantial and difficult parts of the selling process (having the merchandise, finding customers, getting customers to place orders, and delivering the merchandise to customers) have been completed. Collecting the accounts receivable is usually an automatic process which requires little or no effort.
General guidance for determining when revenues are earned can be found in paragraphs 83 and 84 of the FASB's Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No. 5, Recognition and Measurement in Financial Statements of Business Enterprises and in an Intermediate Accounting textbook.",what
Can a fully depreciated asset be revalued?,"A fully depreciated asset cannot be revalued because of accounting's cost principle.
Definition of a Fully Depreciated Asset
A fully depreciated asset is one that has accumulated depreciation equal to its cost. Hence, the book value of the asset is $0. Once an asset is fully depreciated, there will be no additional depreciation expense.
Example of a Fully Depreciated Asset
Let's assume that a company purchased a building more than 30 years ago at a cost of $600,000. The company then depreciated the building at a rate of $20,000 per year for 30 years. Today the building continues to be used by the company and it plans to continue using it for many more years. The company's current balance sheet will report the building at its cost of $600,000 minus its accumulated depreciation of $600,000 (a book value of $0) even if the building's current market value is $2,000,000.
Unless there are improvements to the building, there will be no depreciation expense after the 30th year.",what
What is IFRS?,"IFRS is the acronym for International Financial Reporting Standards. IFRS is used throughout the world except in the United States where U.S. GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) is followed.
There is an urgency for the U.S. to adopt the IFRS because of the growth in global financial markets, global commerce, acquisition of U.S. companies by corporations outside of the U.S., multinational corporations having subsidiaries both inside and outside of the U.S., and so on. Since financial statements report two or three years of amounts, the amounts from earlier years will need to follow IFRS in order to be comparative.
Efforts are also under way for a simplified version of IFRS that would apply for small and medium sized privately held corporations.",what
What does arms length transaction mean?,"An arms length transaction involves two independent parties and each is attempting to get the best deal possible.
For example, if your mother is selling her two-year old car to you for $7,000 and the blue book wholesale value is $14,000, that is NOT an arms length transaction. Your mother is giving you a very good deal instead of attempting to get the fair market value of the car.
In an arms length transaction, the seller of a car attempts to get as much as possible for the car from an independent person who is striving to get the car for the lowest possible price. Both parties probably know the retail value and the wholesale value of the car and both want the best price: the seller is attempting to sell the car at a price that is close to the retail value and the buyer is attempting to buy the car for the wholesale value or less.",what
Where is a contract with a customer reported on the balance sheet?,"A contract to perform future services for a customer is not reported on the balance sheet of the company that will be providing the services.  For example, if Company Jay and one of its customers sign a contract in December agreeing that Company Jay will deliver $20,000 of services beginning in January, the contract is not reported on Company Jay's December 31 balance sheet. (If the customer makes a deposit of $3,000 at the time of signing the contract, the $3,000 will be recorded by Company Jay in December with a $3,000 debit to Cash and a $3,000 credit to the liability account Customer Deposits or Unearned Revenues. With no downpayment or advance payment in December, there is no entry recorded.)
The $20,000 contract is not reported as an asset on Company Jay's December 31 balance sheet. The reason is that Company Jay has not earned any of the contract amount and therefore does not have a right or a receivable to the $20,000 as of December 31. Similarly, Company Jay's income statement for December and its December 31 owner's equity cannot include any earnings associated with the contract.",what
Should a cash discount be recorded as a reduction to an expense?,"Yes, a cash discount should be a reduction to an expense. After all, accountants  define cost as the cash amount (or cash equivalent amount) at the time of the transaction.
To illustrate, let's assume that your company receives marketing consulting services and is billed $10,000 with terms of 1/10, net 30. If the bill is paid within 10 days, the cost is $9,900 ($10,000 minus the 1% discount of $100). This means that Cash should be credited for $9,900 and that the account Marketing Consulting Expenses should be debited $9,900. The cost of the marketing services was the cash price of $9,900.
It would be wrong to record $10,000 as a debit  to Marketing Consulting Expenses and to record a credit  of $100 in the account Cash Discounts. The reason is that the Cash Discounts is usually intended to be a contra account for Purchases, which is used by companies that purchase goods for resale.",what
What is the transaction approach and balance sheet approach to measuring net income?,"The transaction approach to measuring net income is the traditional bookkeeping and accounting method. That is, individual transactions such as each sale, each purchase, and every expense are recorded into general ledger accounts. At any point you can go to an account such as Salaries Expense for Sales Staff and see the year to date amount of such an expense. With the use of accounting software, an enormous quantity of transactions can be recorded into many detailed accounts.
I believe that the balance sheet approach is also referred to as the capital maintenance approach. Under the balance sheet approach one looks at the change in stockholders' or owner's equity to determine the amount of net income during the period between balance sheets. This approach requires that you exclude any additional capital from the owners as well as any dividends or withdrawals distributed to the owners. For example, if stockholders' equity increased by $5 million with $2 million caused by the issuance of new shares of stock, and $1 million distributed as dividends, the net income would have been $4 million. We can verify the calculation with the following:  net income of $4 (an addition to equity) plus new investor money of $2 (an addition to equity) = $6 of additions to equity, minus dividends of  $1 (a decrease to equity) = $5 (the net increase to equity). Under this balance sheet approach you will not have the detailed information on revenues and expenses that would be available under the transaction approach.",what
Is the depreciation of delivery trucks a period cost or is it manufacturing overhead?,"The depreciation on the trucks used to deliver products to customers is a period cost. The depreciation on delivery trucks will be reported as an expense on the income statement in the period in which it occurs. It might be reported as part of Selling Expenses or as part of Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses.
The depreciation on the trucks used to transport materials or work-in-process between the facilities of a manufacturer is a component of manufacturing overhead. In other words, the depreciation on trucks used in the manufacturing process is assigned to the goods produced rather than being expensed directly.",what
What is a natural business year?,"A natural business year is the period of 12 consecutive months (or 52-53 consecutive weeks) ending at a low point of an organization's activities. For example, a school district will have a natural business year of July 1 through June 30, since classes for the school year end in early June.
A retailer's natural business year might be the 52-53 consecutive weeks ending on the Saturday closest to each February 1. This is a low point of activity as it follows the retailer's holiday season and its January clearance sales. The 52-53 week periods (instead of 12 month periods) will result in an equal number of Saturdays in most of the natural business years (as well as in the 13-week quarters and in the 4-5 week months).
Many companies have a natural business year of January 1 through December 31. On the other hand, some companies are required by government regulations to end their accounting years on December 31, even though it is not the end of their natural business year.
The term fiscal year is associated with companies having financial reporting years that do not end on December 31.",what
How should the cost of a yearly subscription for a newspaper be recorded?,"In theory, the payment in advance for a one-year subscription should initially be recorded as a debit to Prepaid Expenses and a credit to Cash. During the subscription period, you would debit Subscription Expense and would credit Prepaid Expenses. 
For example, if the annual subscription cost is $240 and it is paid in advance, you would initially debit Prepaid Expenses for $240 and credit Cash for $240. If your company issues monthly financial statements, then each month during the subscription period you would debit Subscription Expense for $20 and credit Prepaid Expenses for $20. This results in 1) the matching of $20 to expense on each of the monthly income statements, and 2) the balance sheet reporting the amount that is prepaid or not yet expired.
At a large company, the annual cost of $240 will usually be an immaterial amount. The materiality concept will allow you to violate the matching principle, and to avoid the monthly adjusting entry, by simply debiting Subscription Expense for the entire $240 at the beginning of the one-year subscription period.",what
What is a lease?,"A lease is usually a written agreement between an owner of property (land, building, equipment, vehicle, etc.) and a person or business that will use the property for a stated period of time at a specified series of payments.
The owner of the property is known as the lessor and the person using the property is the lessee.
Some leases are for short periods of time and there is no intention of transferring ownership of the asset in exchange for the rent payments. Two examples of this type of lease are 1) the lease for a one-bedroom apartment covering a 12-month period and rent payments of $1,100 per month, and 2) the lease of a new automobile for 24 months with payments of $300 per month.
Other leases may be for longer periods and ownership of the asset will transfer to the lessee for a small additional payment. An example is a noncancellable lease requiring 60 monthly payments of $600 per month for a forklift truck. At the end of the lease period (after the 60th payment) the lessee may take ownership of the forklift truck for an additional payment of $500.
Since leases are contracts requiring a series of payments, there is a question of how the lease and the related payments should be accounted for by the lessee and the lessor. As of September 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) were close to issuing a common financial accounting reporting standard that will replace the present U.S. accounting rules.",what
What is the effect on financial ratios when using LIFO instead of FIFO?,"During periods of significantly increasing costs, LIFO when compared to FIFO will cause lower inventory costs on the balance sheet and a higher cost of goods sold on the income statement.
This will mean that the profitability ratios will be smaller under LIFO than FIFO. The profitability ratios include profit margin, return on assets, and return on stockholders' equity.
The inventory turnover ratio will be higher when LIFO is used during periods of increasing costs. The reason is that the cost of goods sold will be higher and the inventory costs will be lower under LIFO than under FIFO.",what
Why is manufacturing overhead allocated to products?,"Manufacturing overhead, which is also known as factory overhead, burden, and indirect manufacturing costs, needs to be allocated to products for the following reasons:

Some of the goods manufactured are not sold in the same period in which they were produced.
The goods not sold must be reported at their cost in the company's asset entitled Inventory.
Accounting principles require that each product's inventory cost include both direct and indirect manufacturing costs.
Indirect costs by definition mean they are not directly traceable to a product and will require an allocation.
Some companies set their products' selling prices based on their costs. In the long run, the products' selling prices must be large enough to cover all of a company's manufacturing costs (including the indirect manufacturing costs) plus the company's selling, general and administrative expenses and a profit for the company's owners.

If a company never has inventory (because each period it sells all of its production) the allocation of manufacturing overhead could be avoided. The reason is that all of the manufacturing costs will be reported as the cost of goods sold. However, the company may still choose to allocate the manufacturing overhead for internal pricing decisions or to comply with a government contract.",what
What if a company's Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is understated?,"When a company's Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is understated, the credit balance in this account is too small. This indicates that the company has reported too little of Bad Debts Expense and therefore too much net income.
Having a credit balance in the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts that is too small also means that the company is reporting too much for the following balance sheet items: net receivables, total current assets, working capital, total assets, and owner's equity.",what
Are repairs to office equipment and factory equipment period costs?,"Repairs to office equipment are period costs. That is, the cost of the repairs to office equipment will be reported as a selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense in the period in which the repairs take place.
Repairs to factory equipment are not period costs. Rather, the costs of repairs to factory equipment are product costs. The repair costs within the factory are part of the factory overhead (also known as manufacturing overhead) which is assigned to the products when they are manufactured. When those products are sold, the costs of the products (raw materials, direct labor, and factory overhead) will be expensed as the cost of goods sold. Until the products are sold, the products' costs will be reported as the current asset Inventory.",what
Why are some expenses deferred?,"Generally, expenses are deferred in order to comply with the accounting guideline known as the matching principle.
To illustrate the concept, let's assume that a company pays $3,000 on December 30 to rent a warehouse for the upcoming three-month period of January 1 through March 31. Since none of the $3,000 expires or is used up in December, none of the amount should be reported as rent expense on the income statement for the month of December. Hence the $3,000 is deferred to a balance sheet account such as Prepaid Rent (or Prepaid Expenses), which is a current asset account.
During the three months of January 1 through March 31 (when the prepaid rent is expiring) the $3,000 prepayment must be moved from the balance sheet asset account to an income statement expense account. The usual allocation will involve an adjusting entry to debit Rent Expense for $1,000 and credit Prepaid Rent for $1,000 on January 31, February 28 and March 31.",what
What is the meaning of systematic and rational allocation?,"Systematic and rational allocation is a phrase often cited in the definition of depreciation. In that context it means that the annual depreciation expense should be based on a formula that is logical and acceptable to other unbiased accountants.
For example, depreciating an asset over a 10-year period with the same amount of depreciation expense each year is systematic and rational. Depreciating the asset on the basis of the number of parts it produces is also systematic and rational. However, determining the annual depreciation expense based on each year's profits is not systematic and rational.
Systematic and rational allocations provide for objectivity and consistency, which are important characteristics of accounting.",what
What accounting entry is made when a company receives an order for its goods or services?,"If money is not received with a customer's order, there will be no accounting entry when the order is received. (However, there could be an entry into the company's computer system for scheduling the work, planning for the materials to be on hand, etc.)
The reasons there is not an entry into the company's general ledger accounts (and no effect on the company's financial statements) when the order is received are 1) the company has not yet earned any revenues, and 2) the company does not yet have a right to a receivable or other asset. The revenues and a receivable are not earned until the company ships or delivers the goods or services. 
The company may have a responsibility to deliver what it offered to the customer, but there is no double-entry business transaction to be recorded at the time that the order is received.",what
How are period costs reported in the financial statements?,"Under the accrual method of accounting, period costs such as selling, general and administrative expenses are reported on the income statement in the accounting period in which they are used up or expire. They are referred to as period costs because they are not assigned to products, and therefore cannot be included in the cost of items held in inventory.
If a selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense is prepaid, the prepaid portion will be reported as a current asset. When the prepaid expense expires, it will move to the income statement and become part of that period's SG&A expenses.
Interest expense is also a period cost unless it is determined to be a necessary cost of a self-constructed, long-lived asset.",what
Which date is used to record a credit card transaction?,"When a business uses its credit card, the transaction date is the date the credit card is used, not the date that the credit card statement is paid.
For example, if a business uses its credit card to purchase an asset on December 30, both the asset and the liability to the credit card company should be recorded as of December 30.
When the business pays the credit card company (perhaps 30 days later), the business will be reducing its cash and its liability to the credit card company.",what
Is a manufacturer's product warranty part of its manufacturing overhead or is it part of its SG&A expense?,"The costs associated with a manufacturer's product warranty are part of its selling expenses and therefore part of its SG&A expenses.
If the future costs of the warranty coverage are probable and can be estimated, they are recorded at the time of the sale. The accounting entry will debit Warranty Expense and will credit Warranty Liability. If the estimated warranty costs are recorded at  the time of the sale, the actual costs of the repair work or the replacement of the product during the warranty period will be debited to the Warranty Liability account—thereby reducing the liability balance.",what
What is a deferred asset?,"A deferred asset represents costs that have occurred, but because of certain circumstances the costs can be reported as expenses at a later time. One of these circumstances is the assurance from an electric utility's regulators that the costs being deferred will be recoverable through increases in future utility rates.
To illustrate, let's assume that an electric utility spent $300,000 for a project before it had to be abandoned. The state regulators ruled that the utility may recover the $300,000 from its customers in the form of higher rates over a 5-year period starting next year. Because of this assurance, the utility can record the $300,000 as a deferred asset. In each of the five subsequent years, the utility will credit the deferred asset account for $60,000 and will debit an expense for $60,000. Hence, the $60,000 of increased expenses will be matched with the $60,000 of increased revenues on five annual income statements.
Deferred assets are also referred to as deferred charges, deferred costs, or deferred debits. For the example we used above, utilities will use the term regulatory assets.
The balance in a deferred asset account will be reported on the balance sheet as a current asset and/or as a noncurrent asset depending on the facts involved.",what
What is present value?,"In accounting, present value likely refers to the amount that remains after future cash amounts have been discounted to an earlier time. (The earlier time is depicted on a timeline as the point 0, which is the beginning of period 1.) The discounting process involves removing the time value of money, future interest, etc. which is contained within the future cash amounts.
Accountants will record the present value when neither the cash amount, the cash equivalent amount, nor the fair market value of an item in a transaction is known.
Accountants will also calculate a present value to determine an implicit interest rate or the effective interest rate. For example, if a bond payable with a face value of $100,000 and a stated interest rate of 8% is issued for $99,000 the accountant will seek the interest rate which will discount the future semiannual interest amounts of $40,000 and the maturity value of $100,000 to be exactly $99,000 at the time that the bonds were issued. That rate is the effective interest rate and it will be used to determine each period's interest expense and the amount of the discount on bonds payable to be amortized in each period.",what
FIFO and LIFO is best with which type of products?,"Since FIFO and LIFO pertain to the flow of products' costs, I believe the answer involves the rate of change in the costs of products. In other words, if the costs of a company's products are steady, it won't matter whether a company uses FIFO or LIFO. The reason is that the first or older costs will be similar to the latest or recent costs. On the other hand, if the costs of its products are increasing significantly, there will be significant difference in profits and inventory values between FIFO and LIFO.
In the U.S., accountants often cite LIFO as the preferred method when products' costs are changing. The reason is the matching of the latest costs of products with the sales revenues of the current period. U.S. tax  rules also allow for either FIFO or LIFO, but require that the same cost flow assumption be used on both the company's tax return and on the company's financial statements.
By using LIFO when the costs of products are increasing, the company will be matching the recent higher costs with the current period sales. This will provide not only the improved matching of costs with revenues, it will also result in lower taxable income.",what
What is inflation accounting?,"In the U.S., inflation accounting has resulted in optional supplementary disclosures on the effects of 1) general inflation, and 2) changes in the prices of specific types of assets. In other words, the main financial statements continue to report only the traditional, historical cost amounts without any adjustment for changing prices. [During the years 1979 to 1985, some supplementary disclosures on the effects of changing prices had to be included in the notes to the financial statements of the very large U.S. corporations. From 1986 until today, the supplementary disclosures are optional. Hence, the disclosures are not likely to be made.]
One reason that inflation accounting is now optional for U.S. corporations is that the U.S. inflation rate has been modest or low since 1983. Another reason is the belief that the cost of computing the disclosure amounts will be greater than the benefit to the readers of the financial statements.
To illustrate the logic of inflation accounting, let's assume that the general inflation rate and the changes in the costs of specific assets are increasing at a constant rate of 10% each year. This means that a power plant built for a cost of $1 billion will cost $10 billion at the end of a useful life of 25 years. By computing straight-line depreciation based on the historical cost, the income statement will report depreciation expense of $40 million per year ($1 billion/25 years). Obviously this is much lower than the current cost of the productive capacity being used up each year.
Similarly, if a retailer's cost of items in inventory is increasing at an annual rate of 10%, the cost of goods sold reported on the income statement (based on historical costs) will be less than the cost the company will spend in order to replace the units sold.
The use of historical costs during periods of increasing prices means that companies with large amounts of plant assets and inventory will be reporting net income that is greater than the true economic profit. As a result, the reported net income during inflationary periods is said to include illusory profit.",what
"If a mortgage payment is due by December 31, but the payment is not made until the following month, should the loan payment be accrued at December 31?","The interest portion of the mortgage payment should be accrued as of December 31 under the accrual method of accounting. In other words, there needs to be an adjusting entry dated December 31 to debit Interest Expense and to credit Interest payable for the amount of interest owed as of December 31.
The principal balance on the mortgage loan already appears in the general ledger and on the balance sheet as the liability Mortgage Loan Payable. Therefore, there is no accrual needed for the principal portion of the loan payment due at December 31.",what
Is a postdated check considered to be currency?,"A postdated check—a check with a date that is later than the current date—is not considered to be currency. Further, the postdated check should not be reported as part of the Cash account balance until the date of the check.
If the postdated check was received as payment on accounts receivable, the accounts receivable balance is not reduced until the date of the check.
To illustrate this, let's assume that on August 20 a company receives a $1,000 postdated check. The check is dated September 5 and represents the full payment on one of the company's accounts receivable. Since the postdated check is not considered to be money until the date of the check, the accounts receivable should not be reduced and cash should not be increased until September 5. Therefore, the company's August 31 balance sheet will report that the customer's $1,000 accounts receivable is still due.",what
Should capital budgeting decisions be based on cash flows or revenues and expenses?,"Capital budgeting decisions should be based on cash flows that are adjusted for the time value of money. The time value of money recognizes that a dollar received or spent in the future is less valuable than a dollar received or spent in the present. Calculations such as the internal rate of return, net present value, and excess present value include adjustments for the time value of money. In these calculations present value factors, financial calculators, or computer software are used to discount the cash flows to their present values.
Under accrual accounting, revenues and expenses are reported based on accounting principles. This means that revenues are reported when they are earned, and expenses are matched to the periods of the revenue. In other words, revenues and expenses are not reported on the income statement when the money is received or spent. Further, the revenue and expense amounts are not adjusted for the time value of money because of the monetary unit assumption.",what
How can I determine the inventory methods used by other companies in my industry?,"You can find the inventory methods used by the companies in your industry whose stock is publicly traded by reading the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies contained in each company's Form 10-K. The Form 10-K is the annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission or SEC.
The Summary of Significant Accounting Policies will appear as the first or second item in the Notes to the Financial Statements.
Most publicly traded corporations will have an Investors Relations link at the bottom of their website's home page. On the Investors Relations page you will find a link to the corporation's SEC filings.",what
What is Form 10-K?,"Form 10-K is a corporation's annual report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Form 10-K is required for U.S. corporations whose stock is publicly traded.
Form 10-K contains a wealth of information on the corporation in general such as its products, sales, markets, risks, officers, directors, and more. A significant portion of the Form 10-K is entitled Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. Another major section is Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. You will learn much about the corporation and about accounting by reading a corporation's entire Form 10-K. (In other words, don't skip the notes to the financial statements.)
A corporation's Form 10-K is usually available from each corporation's website (usually under Investor Relations). You can also access and download the SEC reports at no cost from http://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/webusers.htm.",what
Why isn't a key employee reported as an asset on the balance sheet?,"While an employee could be an organization's most valuable asset, accountants record past transactions that can be measured.
Since an employee is not purchased, there is no past transaction and cost that the accountant can record in order to report this person as an asset owned by the entity. The salary and bonuses paid to a key employee are reported as expenses in the period in which the employee performed services.
Not being able to record a valuable employee as an asset is similar to a valuable brand name developed internally by a company over time. Since the brand name was not purchased from another entity, there is no past transaction and purchase cost to be recorded.
I assume that an entity's payment made to another professional sports team for a professional athlete's services for the next three years will result in recording the payment as an asset—a prepaid expense or deferred charge—that will then be amortized to expense over the three year contract.",what
Is the sales tax on merchandise purchased for resale included in inventory?,"In our state, sales tax is paid only by the end customer. In other words, a retailer does not pay sales tax on merchandise that is purchased for resale. To avoid the sales tax, the retailer furnishes the supplier with a reseller's certificate, which allows the supplier to not charge the sales tax.
If a sales tax is paid by the reseller and the sales tax could have been avoided, the sales tax would have to be expensed immediately. Costs that are not necessary cannot be recorded as assets.
If the sales tax could not have been avoided, then the sales tax would be part of the cost of the merchandise purchased. If the merchandise has not been sold, the entire cost will be reported as inventory, a current asset on the balance sheet. If the merchandise has been sold, then the entire cost will be reported on the income statement as the cost of goods sold.",what
How do you account for the rebate on an automobile?,"The rebate on the purchase of an automobile should be recorded as a reduction of the automobile's cost.
The lower automobile cost will result in lower depreciation expense.",what
What are sales taxes?,"In the United States, most of its 50 States assess a sales tax, which is a tax on sales to the end user. For example, in the state of Wisconsin a retailer must collect a 5% sales tax and perhaps another 0.5% for a county sales tax on specified goods and services. The retailer must remit the sales taxes collected within a prescribed time period.
The items subject to sales tax will vary from state to state. In some states basic food items might not be taxed, but meals at restaurants will be subject to sales tax. Some services might be subject to a sales tax. Sales of raw materials to a manufacturer will be exempt if the materials will be used in products that will be manufactured and sold. When the products are sold by the manufacturer to a retailer for resale, the manufacturer will be also be  exempt from collecting a sales tax. Sales by retailer to an end consumer will require the collection of sales taxes. Sales tax can be viewed as a tax on consumption.
In accounting, the sales taxes collected by the seller of the goods or services are not revenues for the seller. For example, if a merchant sells an item for $100 and the item is subject to a 5% sales tax, the merchant will debit Cash for $105 and will credit Sales for $100 and will credit Sales Tax Payable for $5. Sales Tax Payable is a liability account. When the sales taxes are remitted to the state, the merchant will debit Sales Tax Payable.",what
Where is the discount on the purchase of office furniture recorded?,"The discount received on the purchase of office furniture that will be used by a company is recorded in the same asset account in which the office furniture is recorded. That account might be Furniture and Fixtures or Office Furniture. (The discount is not recorded in Purchase Discounts as this account is only for the discounts on the purchase of merchandise that will be sold.)
To illustrate, let's assume that a company purchases furniture for the office of a newly appointed executive. The cost of the furniture is $10,000 and the invoice allows a discount of 1% if it is paid within 10 days. If the company pays the invoice within 10 days, the Furniture and Fixtures account will increase by $9,900 ($10,000 minus the discount of $100). The depreciation calculations will be based on the cost of $9,900.",what
Would you please help me understand opportunity cost?,"You might think of opportunity cost as the profit you had to forego.
Let's illustrate this with a little story. Suppose that you are the sole owner of a company which uses a special machine to produce a very unique product. Your company has a huge backlog of orders for the product. Every hour that the machine is running, your company is able to generate sales of $500 while incurring incremental costs and expenses of $200. As a result, your company's profit is increasing by $300 for each hour that the machine is running.
Now suppose an employee failed to perform a routine maintenance task which causes the machine to be shut down for 10 hours. The repair bill to get the machine running was $400. What was the cost of the machine being down for 10 hours? The accounting records will report $400 in the account Repairs and Maintenance Expense. But as the owner, you are likely to be more upset that the employee cost you $3,000 (10 hours X $300) in lost profits and upset customers.
In the above story the opportunity cost was $3,000 of lost profit + the cost of the upset customers. (From the owner's perspective, the total cost was the $400 repair bill + $3,000 of opportunity cost described above + the opportunity cost consisting of future lost profits from lost customers.)
Now let's modify the story. Suppose the machine that was idled by employee negligence was not a special machine and there was no backlog of orders for the product. The repair bill was the same $400. In this situation you will not be foregoing any sales or losing any customers. Therefore the profit foregone is $0. In other words, there is no opportunity cost of the machine being down for 10 hours. All you have is the $400 repair bill.
This concept of opportunity cost is relevant in making decisions. For example, in deciding whether to make or to buy a component, the opportunity cost is an important consideration: If your plant has idle capacity, you might opt to make a component because there is no opportunity cost—no profit being foregone as you spend time making the component. On the other hand, if your plant is operating at full capacity, you would have to forego the profit on some items presently being produced (an opportunity cost) in order to make the components.
The concept of opportunity cost is also relevant when setting transfer prices between divisions or subsidiaries of a large company.",what
What is the rationale for not reporting plant assets at their liquidation value?,"I will assume that the plant assets' liquidation values are higher than the present carrying values when answering your question.
Plant assets (buildings and equipment used in manufacturing; also called fixed assets) are not reported at their higher liquidation value because of several accounting principles. Below are four accounting principles that come to mind.
The cost principle requires that plant assets be reported at amounts that are not greater than cost. Cost is an objective and verifiable amount. Liquidation value is subjective and the amount can vary significantly depending on the assumptions made.
The matching principle requires that the cost of plant assets be allocated to depreciation expense. This means that over a plant asset's useful life some of the plant asset cost is matched with revenues on the income statement. Therefore the plant asset's carrying amount will be decreasing each period.
The going concern assumption implies that the company will be continuing in business. Since it is assumed that the company is not liquidating, the liquidation value of the plant assets is not relevant.
The revenue recognition principle prohibits a company from showing a gain from merely holding a plant asset. What would you credit if you increased the plant asset amount?
Those four accounting principles provide some of the rationale for not reporting the liquidation value when it is higher than cost.
If a company is not a going concern or if the plant asset's value has been impaired, the above rationale does not hold. For those situations you will need to follow the appropriate accounting rules.",what
How do you record the sales tax on the purchase of an asset?,"Accountants define the cost of an asset as all of the costs that are necessary to obtain the asset and to get it ready for use.
If your state does not allow an exemption from sales tax for the asset you purchased, the sales tax should be recorded as part of the cost of the asset.",what
What does NOI stand for?,"NOI is the acronym for net operating income. Net operating income is also referred to as income from operations.
NOI excludes discontinued operations, extraordinary items, and nonoperating (or other) items such as interest expense, interest revenues, gains, and losses.",what
What is a product cost?,"Definition of a Retailer's Product Cost
In accounting, a retailer’s product cost is the cost paid to a supplier plus any other costs that are necessary to get the product in place and ready for sale. For example, if a retailer pays $40 to its supplier and then pays $10 to get it delivered to its warehouse, the retailer’s product cost is $50. 
Definition of a Manufacturer's Product Cost
A manufacturer’s product cost includes the cost of each product’s raw materials plus the costs of converting the raw materials into products. The manufacturer's product costs are usually classified into three groups:

Raw materials used in the product
Direct labor used to make the product
Manufacturing overhead incurred to make the product

Since the manufacturing overhead costs are indirect costs, they must be allocated to the products manufactured to comply with financial accounting standards and U.S. income tax regulations. The details for allocating or assigning the manufacturing costs to the products manufactured are contained in the college course known as cost accounting or managerial accounting.
Product Costs Are Used for Inventory and Cost of Goods Sold
Both the product costs of a retailer and the product costs of a manufacturer are also referred to as inventoriable costs, since the product costs are used to value their goods in inventory. When the goods are sold, the product costs will be removed from inventory and will appear on the income statement as the cost of goods sold.
SG&A Not Included in Product Costs
The selling, general, administrative (SG&A) and interest costs of a retailer and/or a manufacturer are not product costs. Rather, they are reported as expenses on the income statement of the accounting period in which they were incurred.",what
Are repairs to office equipment an expense?,"Repairing and maintaining office equipment is an immediate expense. This is true even if the repair cost is a very large amount.
If a large expenditure is made to improve office equipment, that cost would be recorded as an asset and then depreciated over the remaining life of the equipment.
Small expenditures to improve office equipment are usually expensed immediately because of the materiality concept. This means the amount is so small that no one will be misled by having the entire amount appear immediately as an expense rather than appearing as depreciation expense over several years. Often improvements of less than $500 or $1,000 are considered immaterial and are expensed immediately.",what
What does the cost principle mean for a company's income statement?,"If a company has buildings, equipment and inventory, the cost principle will mean that the amount of depreciation expense and the cost of goods sold expense will be based on the costs when the assets were acquired. If these assets have increased in value, the depreciation and cost of goods sold reported on the income statement will be less than the value of the economic capacity being used up. As a result, the reported net income will be greater than the economic reality.
To illustrate this point let's assume that the cost of a bank building was $10 million and was fully depreciated during its first 30 years of use. The cost principle requires the depreciation expense on the bank's income statement for year 31 (and each year thereafter) to be $0 even if the bank building's market value has doubled. Similarly, a manufacturer using equipment that is fully depreciated will have lower manufacturing overhead and lower cost of goods sold because the current year's depreciation for the equipment is $0.
Generally, the cost principle requires that only the verifiable, historical costs recorded at the time of transactions will appear as expenses on the income statement. Unfortunately those recorded costs may not measure the economic reality that is occurring in the period of the income statement.",what
Do variance accounts have an impact on financial statements? Or are they for performance evaluation only?,"Since the financial statements must reflect the cost principle, both the standard costs and the variances must be included in the financial statements.
For example, if a direct material has a standard cost of $400 but the company paid $422, the financial statement must report $422 (the standard cost of $400 plus the price variance of $22).
How the variances are reported on the financial statements is discussed in the last part of our Explanation of Standard Costing.",what
Should an owner's compensation be recorded as an expense or in the Drawing account?,"If the enterprise is a sole proprietorship, the owner's compensation should be debited to the Drawing account.
If the enterprise is a corporation, the owner's gross compensation should be debited to a salary expense account.",what
What is opportunity cost?,"Opportunity cost is the profit that was lost or missed because of some action or failure to take some action.
To illustrate opportunity cost, let's assume that you want to add a website to your already successful business. You are confident that it will increase your company's profit by $1,500 each week. A highly-trusted and successful firm will complete the website in 3 weeks with a total cost of $10,000. A friend has offered to do the work for $6,500 but it will take 5 weeks.
Choosing your friend looks better because the $3,500 saved ($6,500 instead of $10,00) is less than the opportunity cost of $3,000 (the $1,500 per week that is not earned multiplied times the additional 2 weeks it will take your friend to develop the website).
Now let's assume that your friend will require 7 weeks to complete the website. This means that your business will be losing the opportunity to earn an additional $1,500 per week for 4 weeks (your friend's 7 weeks instead of the firm's 3 weeks). That opportunity cost of $6,000 plus the $6,500 payment means a total cost of $12,500 if your friend develops the website. Hence, you would be better off paying the firm $10,000 and the benefit of having the site working 4 weeks sooner.
Interestingly, the opportunity costs are not recorded in the general ledger accounts. Hence, only the $6,500 paid to your friend will be recorded as the cost of the website. (The 4 weeks of missed profits are not recorded and will not be widely discussed.)
This is also a reminder that the opportunity costs and future amounts are the important ones for making decisions. Unfortunately, the future amounts are not in the general ledger and are probably not known at the time a decision has to be made.",what
Does the accrual method apply to the purchase of equipment?,"The accrual method does apply to the purchase of equipment (as well as applying to revenues and expenses).
To illustrate, let's assume that on December 29 a company ordered and received some equipment to be used in its operations. The payment for the equipment is to be made on February 10. Under the accrual method, on December 29 the company should debit the asset account Equipment and credit the liability account Accounts Payable. (When the supplier or vendor is paid on February 10, the company's asset Cash will be credited and its liability account Accounts Payable will be debited.)",what
What is apportionment?,"An apportionment is an allocation based on some proportions.
I associate the term apportionment with a corporation's taxable income that was earned in many states within the U.S. In that situation, the corporation's taxable income must be allocated or apportioned to each of the states based upon certain accepted factors. In the past, the apportionment or allocation was often based on a corporation's tangible property, employees, and sales in each of the states. More recently, apportionments seem to be based more on sales or receipts within each state.
Since AccountingCoach.com does not cover income taxes, you should contact a tax professional for a more accurate and complete explanation.",what
What if an employee's actual vacation payment is greater than the amount that has been accrued?,"Let's assume that a company's accounting year ends on December 31 and the company has only one employee who worked the full year. The company's handbook specifies that the employee earns 10 hours of vacation for each month worked. However, the vacation hours for the year accumulate. The total vacation hours earned as of December 31 will be paid to the employee on June 1 of the following year by using the employee's June 1 pay rate.
Next, let's assume that each month the company records an accrual adjusting entry that debits Vacation Expense for $200 (10 hours X $20 per hour) and credits Vacation Liability for $200. As a result, the balance in the balance sheet account Vacation Liability at December 31 is $2,400 (12 months X $200, or 120 hours X $20).
On the following June 1, the employee's pay rate is $20.50 which means the employee's gross vacation pay will be $2,460 (120 hours X $20.50). The June 1 journal entry to record the vacation payment is:

Debit Vacation Payable $2,400 (to eliminate the December 31 liability)
Debit Vacation Expense $60
Credit Cash, Payroll Withholdings, etc. for a total of $2,460

Note that the $60 difference was recorded as Vacation Expense in the year of the payment. The financial statements of the prior year were not restated for the $5 monthly differences. The reason is the prior year's monthly amounts were estimates (not mistakes) and the difference is immaterial.",what
What is accounting for price level changes?,"In 1979 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued its Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 33 entitled Financial Reporting and Changing Prices. (You will find the original Statement No. 33 on www.FASB.org.) In short, Statement No. 33 required large companies to report supplementary information on the effects of changing prices on its inventory and its property, plant and equipment. (In the late 1970's the U.S. was experiencing double-digit inflation rates and the SEC was advocating the reporting of replacement cost.)
One disclosure required by Statement 33 was the reporting of the effects of general inflation as indicated by the change in the consumer price index. In other words, a large company had to disclose in the notes to its financial statements some key amounts after adjusting inventory and property, plant and equipment amounts for the changes in the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar. The second disclosure reported the effects of the changes in the specific prices of inventory and property, plant and equipment.
In 1986 the FASB issued its Statement No. 89 which no longer required the reporting of the information. As a result, most companies stopped the calculations and reporting. Two of the factors in deciding to stop the calculations was the lack of use by financial analysts and a decline in the rates of inflation in the U.S. In other words, the accounting for price level changes failed to pass the cost/benefit test.",what
How do I record exterior cement work? Is it an asset or an expense?,"If the cement work was done to repair or maintain existing cement work, then the expenditure should be recorded as an expense. Even if the cost is very large, repairs and maintenance must be expensed. The cost of repairs or maintenance cannot be recorded as an asset.
If the cement work is an addition or an improvement (more than repairing or maintaining existing cement work), the cost of the cement work is viewed as a new asset. If the amount is significant, you should record the expenditure as an asset and then depreciate the cost over the useful life. However, if the amount of the addition or the improvement is relatively small, the accounting concept of materiality allows you to expense the entire amount immediately.",what
Is a utility bill an expense?,"The utility bill for a retailer or for a service company is an expense. Under the accrual basis of accounting, the utility bill is an expense for the period indicated by the meter reading dates.
A manufacturer's utility bill is more complicated. The utility bill for its selling and general administration will be an expense for the period indicated by the meter reading dates. However, the utility bill for the direct and indirect manufacturing operations is part of its manufacturing overhead. As such, the utility bill will be assigned or allocated to the units produced. In other words, the utility bill will be clinging to the units produced. Some of the utility cost will be clinging to the units in inventory and therefore will be part of the cost of the asset inventory. Some of the utility cost will be clinging to the units that have been sold and will be part of the expense known as the cost of goods sold.",what
What are external financial statements?,"The external financial statements of a U.S. corporation should consist of a complete set of the following:

income statement (statement of earnings, statement of operations)
statement of comprehensive income
balance sheet (statement of financial position)
statement of cash flows (cash flow statement)
statement of stockholders' equity (statement of shareholders' equity, statement of equity)
notes to the financial statements

These financial statements become ""external"" when they are distributed to people and organizations not involved in the corporation's operations. Some examples of external users are current investors and lenders, potential investors and lenders, financial analysts, certain government agencies, credit rating organizations, certain customers and suppliers, and others.
Since the external financial statements are likely to be compared to those of other corporations (and to previously issued financial statements), it is imperative that standardized rules be followed. In the U.S. these common rules are known as generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which are established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).",what
"If a mortgage payment is due on January 1, should the payment be accrued at December 31?","The following answer assumes that the accrual basis of accounting (also known as the accrual method of accounting) is being used...
If the interest portion of the January 1 loan payment is for the month of December, then the interest portion should be accrued as of December 31.
To illustrate, let's assume that the amount of the mortgage loan payment due on January 1 is $1,000 and it consists of $300 of interest from December 1 through 31, and a principal payment of $700.
Since the $300 of interest has occurred during December and since the company has an obligation as of December 31 to the lender for that interest, the company must accrue the interest. This is accomplished with an adjusting entry dated December 31 in which Interest Expense is debited for $300 and Interest Payable is credited for $300.
There is no accrual for the principal portion of the loan payment. The principal balance of the loan is not reduced until the actual principal payment occurs.",what
What is the net method?,"In accounting and bookkeeping, the net method often refers to how a company records each vendor invoice. Under the net method, the company will credit Accounts Payable for the invoice amount minus any early payment discount that is offered. For example, if a vendor's invoice for $1,000 has credit terms of 2/10, net 30 days, the company will record the invoice at the net amount of $980 ($1,000 minus 2% of $1,000). In this example, Accounts Payable will be credited for $980 and another account (Inventory, Purchases, etc.) will be debited for $980. 
If the company's policy is to pay all vendor invoices within the discount period, the net method will result in a more precise current liability on its balance sheet. It will also mean that the accounts and amounts recorded as debits will better reflect the historical cost principle.
If the company fails to remit the net amount within the discount period, the net method requires a debit entry to the expense Purchase Discounts Lost. In our example, if the company pays the invoice in 30 days, it is not entitled to the early payment discount and will therefore have to credit Cash for $1,000. The debit amounts will be Accounts Payable for $980 and Purchase Discounts Lost for $20. Any amount recorded in Purchase Discounts Lost informs management that its policy of paying within the discount period has been violated.
Although the net method is theoretically better, it seems to be less efficient than recording vendor invoices at their stated amounts.",what
Why is there a large difference between share value and stockholders' equity?,"There can be many reasons why the market value of a corporation's stock is much greater than the amount of stockholders' equity reported on the balance sheet. Let's start by defining stockholders' equity as the difference between the asset amounts reported on the balance sheet minus the liability amounts. Next, the accountant's cost principle requires that only the cost of items purchased can be reported as an asset. This means that valuable trade names that were never purchased (but were developed over time) are not reported on the balance sheet. The same holds for a great management team and an amazing reputation. The cost principle also means that many long-term assets are reported at cost (and not at their current higher market value). Many plant assets are reported at minimal amounts because their costs have been reduced by the cumulative amount of depreciation taken over the years.
Other factors contributing to a high market value might be a corporation's earnings and dividends that are consistently growing and/or a special niche for its products or services that is recognized by the market.
Lastly, a corporation's stockholders' equity may have been reduced from the purchase of treasury stock at a high cost.",what
Are undeposited checks reported as cash?,"Undeposited checks that are not postdated (not dated with a future date) are reported as cash. Accountants define cash as more than just currency and coins. For example, unrestricted checking accounts are also reported as cash.",what
What is purchase discounts lost?,"The account Purchase Discounts Lost is found in the general ledger of a company that records vendors' invoices using the net method. An amount is entered in Purchase Discounts Lost only when the company fails to pay an invoice within the vendor's discount period.
To illustrate the net method and Purchase Discounts Lost, let's assume that a retailer's policy is to always pay a vendor's legitimate invoice within its discount period if the invoice offers an early payment discount. Let's also assume that one vendor's invoice is for $1,000 and has terms of 2/10, net 30 days. After reviewing and approving the invoice, the retailer will debit Purchases (or Inventory) for $980 ($1,000 minus 2% discount) and will credit Accounts Payable for $980.
If the retailer pays the vendor $980 within the 10-day discount period, it will be recorded with a debit to Accounts Payable for $980 and a credit to Cash for $980. However, if the retailer fails to pay the invoice within the discount period, the retailer will need to remit $1,000 to the vendor. In that case the retailer will credit Cash for $1,000; debit Accounts Payable for $980; and debit Purchase Discounts Lost for $20. Purchase Discounts Lost is considered to be an expense (as opposed to being a cost of the goods). The cost of the goods remains at $980 (the cash price) because in accounting cost is defined as cash or the cash equivalent amount. The $20 is viewed as interest expense or a financing charge since the retailer was apparently unable to remit the cash price of $980 within the discount period.",what
Is the sales tax paid on merchandise that you will resell an expense?,"I believe that most states have sales tax exemptions for merchandise purchased for resale. Check with your state's sales tax department to see if you can obtain a resellers permit to avoid being charged the sales tax by your suppliers.
If you purchase an asset and the sales tax is required, the sales tax should be recorded as part of the cost of the goods or services received. For example, if you were required to pay sales tax on the new company car, the cost of the car will include the sales tax. If you purchased supplies and the cost of the supplies was subject to sales tax, the sales tax is part of the cost of the supplies. If you received services that were subject to the sales tax, the sales tax is a necessary part of the cost of the services.",what
What is NIFO?,"NIFO is the acronym for next-in, first-out.
NIFO is a cost flow assumption, just as FIFO and LIFO are cost flow assumptions. However, NIFO is not acceptable for financial reporting since it calls for a future cost. NIFO is sometimes used as an expression of replacement cost.
Even though NIFO cannot be used for valuing inventory and the cost of goods sold on the financial statements, it is useful for making decisions. For example, some companies will use NIFO when determining selling prices.",what
What causes a corporation's market value to be greater than its book value?,"One cause of a corporation's market value being greater than its book value is the accountant's cost principle. In order for an item to be listed as an asset on a corporation's balance sheet, the item must have been purchased (or donated). If an item is not listed on the balance sheet as an asset, it will not be included in a corporation's book value. (A corporation's book value is the amount of stockholders' equity reported on the balance sheet, which is the amount of assets reported minus the amount of liabilities reported.)
Often a corporation's most valuable assets were not purchased and, therefore, will not be reported as assets and will not be included in the corporation's book value. Think of the late Steve Jobs and the culture he developed at Apple. He and his team, the innovative culture, the wildly successful brand names, etc. could never be listed on the balance sheet as assets nor directly included in the corporation's book value.
On the other hand, the market does recognize those attributes as being immensely valuable. Hence the corporation's market value was and is greater than its book value.",what

What is obsolete inventory?,"Definition of Obsolete Inventory
Obsolete inventory refers to products that a company had purchased or produced which cannot be sold. The obsolete items may be the result of one or more of the following:

Innovations that make the products worthless, inconvenient, unattractive, etc.
New technologies that disrupt the way things are done
Decline in overall demand for the items
Arrival of unique competitors

Consequences of Obsolete Inventory
When inventory items become obsolete, the reality is that their value is significantly lower than their cost. As a result, the U.S. accounting rules require that the cost of the obsolete inventory items be reduced to their net realizable value. Failure to reduce their cost will mean that the following amounts on the company's financial statements will be overstated:

Inventory
Current assets
Working capital
Profits
Owner’s or stockholders’ equity

Benefits of Disposing of Obsolete Inventory
Since the value of the obsolete items may continue to decrease, it is wise to dispose of the items at any price as soon as possible. The benefits of disposing of the obsolete items will result in the company:

Having realistic financial statements
Being eligible for a U.S. income tax benefit
Having less inventory holding costs
Being confronted with the total cost of holding items in inventory",what
Why is the Cash Flow Statement identified as one of the financial statements?,"The Cash Flow Statement or Statement of Cash Flows is required as part of a full set of financial statements because of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows.

Which financial statement shows a corporation's worth?,"Not one of the financial statements will show a corporation's worth. The balance sheet, income statement, statement of cash flows, and stockholders' equity statement merely provide information to assist financial experts in forming an opinion of a corporation's worth.
In the past, some people mistakenly thought that a corporation's stockholders' equity was the corporation's worth. However, stockholders' equity (or the owner's equity of a proprietorship) is merely the result of subtracting the reported amount of liabilities from the reported amount of assets. Since the reported amounts reflect the cost principle and other accounting principles, the net result cannot be assumed to be the company's worth.",what
Can I capitalize this year's R&D?,"Generally, R&D costs cannot be capitalized for U.S. financial statements according to the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 2, Accounting for Research and Development Costs. The original pronouncement can be viewed at www.FASB.org/st.
We are not able to address the second part of your question, which involved the R&D costs on the income tax returns. You will need to ask an income tax adviser or do a search on www.IRS.gov regarding the capitalization of R&D costs for income tax purposes.",what
Why is a product that sells for $50 reported in inventory at its cost of $40?,"Generally, items in inventory are valued at their cost—not their selling prices—because of the cost principle.
Another reason for not valuing items in inventory at their selling prices is that inventory items cannot be sold without a sales effort. Until that effort is made and an item is actually sold, the company cannot report the $10 increase from $40 to $50. This is referred to as the revenue recognition principle. In other words, only after an item is actually sold can the company report the revenue of $50 minus the cost of $40 for a gross profit of $10.
There are some exceptions to reporting inventory at cost. One exception is industries where no sales effort is required and the extensive effort of production has been completed. In these industries the inventory may be reported at its net realizable value, which is the sales value minus the costs to dispose of the items. The gold mining industry and certain other commodities are examples.
Another exception to reporting inventory at cost occurs in any industry when a product will have to be sold for less than its cost. In that situation the item should normally be reported at its net realizable value. (U.S. income tax rules require conformity between tax and financial reporting. As a result, there are complexities involved.)",what
What are gains?,"Definition of Gains
In financial accounting, gains often pertain to some of a company’s transactions which occur outside of the company’s main business activities. Transactions which are outside of a company’s main business activities are referred to as nonoperating activities. 
Gain vs Operating Income
Let's assume that a company is a retailer whose main business activities are the purchasing and reselling of merchandise. When the retailer sells $5,000 of merchandise that it had purchased at a cost of $3,000, the retailer’s income statement will report sales of merchandise of $5,000 and cost of goods sold of $3,000. The difference of $2,000 is part of the retailer's gross profit, operating income, and net income. The word ""gain"" is not appropriate since the activities involved the normal business activities of the retailer.
However, if the same retailer sells its old delivery van, this transaction is outside of the retailer’s main business activities of purchasing and selling merchandise. Therefore, the sale of the van will not be included with the sales of merchandise. Instead, a gain (or loss) will be reported as one of the company’s nonoperating items often under the heading of other income.
Calculating a Gain
To illustrate the calculation of a gain, let’s assume that the retailer sells its old van for $5,000 cash. At the time of the sale the van is on the retailer’s books at $3,500 (which consists of its original cost of $20,000 and accumulated depreciation of $16,500). Since this transaction is not a main business activity of the retailer and since the $5,000 of cash received is greater than the net cost of $3,500 being removed from the accounts, the retailer will report a nonoperating item described as gain on sale of van of $1,500. 
More Examples of Gains
Other examples of gains that could appear on a company’s income statement include:

Gain on sale of investments
Gain on sale of building
Gain on legal settlement
Gain on early extinguishment of debt",what
How can I determine the difference in earnings from using LIFO instead of FIFO?,"The difference in a corporation's earnings from using LIFO instead of FIFO can be determined by the amounts reported in the balance sheet account LIFO Reserve. Generally, the LIFO Reserve information is found in the notes to the financial statements.",what
What is a debenture?,"A debenture is an unsecured bond. In other words, a debenture is a bond without a lien on specific assets owned by the issuing corporation.",what
What is self-insurance?,"Self-insurance means no insurance. For example, if a retailer decides to self-insure its buildings, the retailer will not have an insurance policy to pay for losses that may occur to its buildings. If a person causes a loss to one of the retailer's buildings, the retailer will have to bring a claim against that person. In other words, the retailer will be on its own and will not be able to turn to an insurance company to take care of the problem.
Self-insurance may be feasible if a company owns a large number of buildings and each building is in a different city. For example, a retailer with 100 small stores finds that the annual cost for property insurance to cover all 100 stores is $100,000. If the total actual property damages for the stores never exceeded $40,000 in a year, the company may decide that self-insurance is a good business risk.
Generally, self-insurance is too risky for an individual and for a small business with one store. The reason is that a huge loss to its one building may be too much to recover from. Every company should review its specific situation with a professional risk management adviser before opting to self-insure.
When a company does self-insure, it will report its actual losses in the accounting period in which the losses occur. This may result in huge losses in some years and no losses in other years. (On the other hand, if a company has an insurance policy, the premiums it pays will result in a more consistent amount of insurance expense each and every year.)",what
What is illusory profit?,"Illusory profit, also called phantom profit, is the difference between 1) the profit reported using historical costs required by US GAAP, and 2) the profit computed using replacement costs. Illusory profit is greatest during periods of rising costs at companies with significant amounts of inventory and plant assets.
For example, when inventory is measured by using the first-in, first-out cost flow assumption under US GAAP, the actual historical cost of inventory that is charged to the cost of goods sold during periods of rising costs is smaller than the amount computed using replacement costs. This smaller amount of costs charged to the income statement means reporting greater profit. The difference in the profit is said to be illusory.
In the case of plant assets used during periods of rising costs, the depreciation expense reported on the income statement based on historical costs (required by US GAAP) will be less than the depreciation computed by using the higher replacement cost of the plant assets. The additional profit from this difference in depreciation is considered to be illusory profit.",what
I don't understand the conservatism principle. Why do losses get recorded but not gains?,"Conservatism has to do with uncertainty. When uncertainty exists between two alternatives that appear to be reasonable, the accountant ""breaks the tie"" by picking the alternative that reports less profit and less asset amount (or more liability amount).
If there is uncertainty as to whether there was a gain, the rule says don't record it. Because of the uncertainty and because you did not record the potential gain, there will be less profit and less asset amounts being reported.
(If there is certainty about a gain, then you do report the gain. For example, if a company sells its old delivery truck for cash and the amount received is greater than the truck's book value, there is no uncertainty and a gain is reported.)
If there is uncertainty about whether or not there is a loss, the rule directs you to record the loss. By recording the potential loss, you will be reporting less profit and less asset amounts.
If there is a potential loss, but it is impossible to measure the amount for a journal entry, there needs to be a disclosure in the notes to the financial statements.",what

What does it mean to recognize an expense?,"Definition of Recognize an Expense
To recognize an expense means to report the proper amount of an expense on the income statement for the appropriate accounting period.
When and How to Recognize an Expense

When there is a cause-and-effect relationship between a company's revenues and some of its expenses, these expenses should appear on the same income statement as the associated revenues. Accountants describe this as matching expenses with revenues. For instance, a company's sales of products which are properly reported on its July income statement will cause the related expense known as the cost of goods sold to be reported/recognized on the July income statement. If the company's sales reps have earned commissions on the July sales, these commissions should also be recognized/reported as Commissions Expense on the company's July income statement (regardless of when the company pays the commissions).
If a cause-and-effect relationship does not exist between a company's revenues and its costs, and there is no future economic benefit which can be measured, the costs should be recognized/reported immediately as expenses on the current income statement. A few examples include advertising, office salaries, interest on most loans, and research and development costs.
When a cost has a future economic benefit which can be measured, the accountant should report the cost as an asset. Then as the future benefit expires (is used up) the cost should be systematically recognized/reported as an expense on the appropriate income statements. Some examples include the expensing of prepaid insurance premiums and the depreciation of assets used in the company's business.

Use of Adjusting Entries
Companies use adjusting entries in order for their income statements and balance sheets to be reporting the proper amounts in the appropriate accounting periods under the accrual method of accounting.",what
What are generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)?,"Definition of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
Generally accepted accounting principles (commonly referred to as GAAP or US GAAP) are the common accounting rules that must be followed when a U.S. company prepares financial statements that will be distributed to people outside of the company. 
These common rules range from basic underlying principles and assumptions to the detailed rules established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) for complex financial transactions. The FASB has organized the generally accepted accounting principles in its Accounting Standards Codification (ASC).
Why Generally Accepted Accounting Principles are Required?
Generally accepted accounting principles are required so a knowledgeable reader of financial statements is able to do the following:

Compare a company's current financial statements to the earlier financial statements of the same company
Compare a company's financial statements to those of other companies (especially within the same industry)
Understand how a company recognizes/reports revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, etc.

Examples of the Basic Underlying Accounting Principles
The basic underlying accounting principles consist of the following:

Economic entity assumption
Going concern assumption
Time period assumption
Monetary unit assumption
Cost principle or measurement principle
Matching principle or expense recognition principle
Revenue recognition principle
Full disclosure principle
Industry practices

Related to these underlying accounting principles are the following: objectivity, conservatism, materiality, cost/benefit, comparability, consistency, relevance, and timeliness.",what
Are estimates allowed in bookkeeping?,"While bookkeeping involves mostly precise amounts from sales and purchase invoices, cash receipts and checks written, etc. there are situations when estimates need to be entered. This is especially true when monthly financial statements are prepared under the accrual method of accounting. For instance, the monthly bookkeeping entries for depreciation, property taxes, utilities, fringe benefits and more will need to be estimates.
Even the end-of-year financial statements will require some estimated amounts. For example, a company's liability for warranties on its products and its allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable will need to be estimates. Providing an estimated amount is better than ignoring reality and reporting a zero amount.
I recommend that the company's accountant review the estimated amounts that will be entered in the bookkeeping or accounting system.",what
What type of expense is the purchase of propane?,"Technically, the purchase of propane is not an expense. Depending on the business, the propane is an asset until it is used, resold, or included in a product that is sold. At that time it will become an expense.
If the purchased propane is used relatively soon, accountants will usually skip recording the asset. Here are three examples of how the expense might be reported on the company's income statement.
Example 1. A service company purchases $900 of propane to heat its office for the following month. Technically the propane is an asset until used. However, the accountant is likely to skip recording of the asset and will record the purchase as a $900 operating expense.
Example 2. A local dealer purchases large quantities of propane and then delivers the propane in small quantities to its customers. The dealer will record the purchase as the asset Propane Inventory. As the propane is sold, the dealer will reduce Propane Inventory for the cost of the propane sold and will increase the expense Cost of Goods Sold.
Example 3. A manufacturer uses propane in its factory operations. The cost of the propane purchased is likely to be recorded as Manufacturing Overhead. Manufacturing Overhead is allocated to the products manufactured and will be part of the products' cost. If the products are in Inventory, those products' costs are assets. If the products are sold, those products' costs will be expensed as Cost of Goods Sold.",what
Reducing the Need for Accruing Expenses,"One day I was explaining to the owner of a small business that I would have to accrue for the shipping expenses associated with his company's sales. Since the shipping company billed him on the 15th of each month for his shipments from the 16th of the previous month until the 15th of the current month, we needed to estimate the expense for the second half of the month. For example, when I was preparing his company's November 30th balance sheet and its November income statement, we didn't have the shipping expense for November 16 – 30. (He also let me know that during this 15-day period, the shipping expense would be higher than any other 15-day period due to holiday sales.)
He listened carefully as I explained the matching principle, accrual-type adjusting entries, and reversing entries. As soon as I had finished, he phoned the shipping company and asked that his billing period be changed to cover the calendar month. They were pleased to make the change.
Next, the owner called his bank and asked if the bank would be able to deduct the current month's loan interest from the company's checking account on the last day of each month. The bank was pleased to arrange for this procedure.
In less than 15 minutes, the owner eliminated the need for me to calculate/estimate the amounts for two adjusting entries every month. Soon, each month's actual amounts would be arriving automatically.",what
"If cash and a note are exchanged for a plant asset, is the amount of the note used in the depreciation calculation?","A plant asset's cost is depreciated, unless the asset is land.
Cost is defined as the cash or cash equivalent amount at the time of the transaction. This means that the asset's cost is the cash amount plus the note's present value at time that the asset is purchased.
To illustrate this, let's assume that equipment is purchased by giving $50,000 of cash plus a promissory note of $100,000. If the note has an interest rate that is a fair rate considering the market rates and the riskiness of the party signing the note, then the present value of the note is $100,000. The equipment will then be recorded at its cost of $150,000. This cost of $150,000 will be depreciated over the equipment's useful life.
If the note specifies zero interest, then the present value of the note is less than $100,000. Let's assume that the note's present value is computed to be $90,000. This means that the asset's cost will be $140,000—the cash of $50,000 plus the note's $90,000 of present value. Assuming no salvage value, the total depreciation expense over the life of the equipment will equal $140,000. The $10,000 difference will be reported as interest expense over the life of the note.",what

Isn't objectivity violated when estimates are used in bookkeeping and accounting?,"The use of estimates does not necessarily violate objectivity. If it is not possible to determine the exact amount of an expense and/or liability within a reasonable time, estimates may be necessary. In that situation, objectivity is met when the estimated amounts are similar to the amounts that another professionally-trained person would also compute with the same available information.
The accounting principles, guidelines and characteristics often involve some degree of trade-offs. For example, a company's financial statements are expected to be both timely and precise. Unfortunately, achieving timeliness and relevance may require sacrificing some precision and reliability.",what
What is a calendar year?,"Definition of Calendar Year
A calendar year is the 12 consecutive months from January through December. In other words, it is the 365 days (366 days in a leap year) beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31.
Example of Calendar Years
In the U.S., individuals file their personal income tax returns based on the calendar year of January 1 through December 31. Many U.S. corporations also have accounting and income tax years that coincide with the calendar year of January 1 through December 31. However, U.S. corporations may have an accounting year and income tax year that is not a calendar year. 
Examples of Non-calendar Years
If a U.S. corporation has a non-calendar accounting year, it is referred to as a fiscal year.
An example is a U.S. retailer whose financial statements report the amounts for the fiscal year covering the 52-week period of Sunday, February 4, 2018 through Saturday, February 3, 2019. 
Often educational institutions have fiscal years that begin on July 1 and end on the following June 30.",what
What is the three-way match?,"Definition of Three-Way Match
In the accounting and bookkeeping area of accounts payable, the three-way match refers to a procedure used when processing an invoice received from a vendor or supplier. The purpose of the three-way match is to avoid paying an incorrect and perhaps fraudulent invoice.
Example of Three-Way Match
The ""three-way"" part of the three-way match refers to the three documents that will be compared:

The vendor's invoice that was received and will become part of an organization's accounts payable when it is approved
The purchase order that was prepared by the organization
The receiving report that was prepared by the organization

The ""match"" part of the three-way match refers to comparing the quantities, price per unit, terms, and other information appearing on the three documents. In other words, does the vendor's invoice detail agree with the organization's purchase order, and to the goods actually received as shown on the organization's receiving report? Only if the details on the three documents are in agreement will the vendor's invoice be entered as an account payable.
The three-way match is an important step in safeguarding an organization's assets.",what
What does per annum mean?,"Definition of Per Annum
Per annum means yearly or annually. It is a common phrase used to describe an interest rate. Often ""per annum"" is omitted, as in ""I have a 4% mortgage loan."" or ""This bond pays interest of 6%.""
Example of Per Annum
An example involves a supplier offering a credit customer an early-payment discount of 2% for paying an invoice in 10 days instead of paying the full amount in 30 days. In this example the supplier is giving up 2% of the invoice amount in order to be paid 20 days early.
To compute the rate per annum we restate the amounts by multiplying both the ""2%"" and the ""20 days"" by 18 (in order to get close to the 365 days in a year). The result is a per annum rate of approximately 36%.
Another example involves a business charging its customers 1.5% per month on any past due balance. The monthly rate of 1.5% can be converted to 18% per annum by multiplying the 1.5% times 12 months in a year.",what
What is a current liability?,"Definition of Current Liability
A current liability is:

An obligation that will be due within one year of the date of the company's balance sheet, and
Will require the use of a current asset or will create another current liability

However, if a company's normal operating cycle is longer than one year, current liabilities are the obligations that will be due within the operating cycle.
Current liabilities are usually reported as a separate section of a company's balance sheet. This allows readers to subtract their total from the company's total amount of current assets in order to determine a company's working capital. (Dividing current assets by the current liabilities is the company's current ratio.)
Examples of Current Liabilities
The following are common examples of current liabilities:

Accounts payable or trade payables
Notes payable that will be due within one year
The principal portion of a long-term loan that must be paid within one year
Wages payable
Income taxes payable
Interest payable
Other accrued expenses payable
Deferred revenues and customer deposits",what
What is a creditor?,"Definition of Creditor
A creditor could be a bank, supplier or person that has provided money, goods, or services to a company and expects to be paid at a later date. In other words, the company owes money to its creditors and the amounts should be reported on the company's balance sheet as either a current liability or a non-current (or long-term) liability.
Examples of Creditors
Some creditors, such as banks and other lenders, have lent money to the company and will require the company to sign a written promissory note for the amount owed. When a promissory note is required, the company borrowing the money will record and report the amount owed as Notes Payable.
If the creditor is a vendor or supplier that did not require the company to sign a promissory note, the amount owed is likely to to be reported as Accounts Payable or Accrued Liabilities.
Other creditors include the company's employees (who are owed wages and bonuses), governments (who are owed taxes), and customers (who made deposits or other prepayments).
Some creditors are referred to as secured creditors because they have a registered lien on some of the company's assets. A creditor without a lien (or other legal claim) on the company's assets is an unsecured creditor.",what
What is the difference between an invoice and a voucher?,"Definition of an Invoice
An invoice received from a vendor is a billing for goods or services that it had provided. The vendor's invoice will include the quantities of the items provided, brief descriptions, unit prices, amount due, credit terms, where to remit payment, etc.
Definition of a Voucher
A voucher is an internal document used by a company's accounts payable department in order to collect and organize the necessary documentation and approvals before paying a vendor's invoice. The voucher acts as a cover page to which the following will be attached: vendor's invoice, company's purchase order, company's receiving report, and other information needed to further process the vendor's invoice for payment.",what
What is the monthly close?,"Definition of Monthly Close
In accounting, monthly close is a series of steps and procedures that are followed so that a company's monthly financial statements are in compliance with the accrual method of accounting.
Since a company's business activities are ongoing, accountants might state ""we need to get a proper ""cut-off"" between the end-of-the-month transactions and those that belong in the following month.
If a company sells goods and has inventories, its monthly close will be more challenging. The company must be certain that the costs of the goods purchased are recorded in the same month as the goods are added to the inventories.
Reviewing the financial statements before they are distributed is also an important step in the monthly close. This could mean comparing the amounts and percentages on the current financial statements to those of earlier months. For example, if the current income statement shows the cost of goods sold as 86% instead of the normal 81%, the current month's amounts should be investigated before releasing the financial statements.",what
How is a voucher used in accounts payable?,"Definition of Voucher
A voucher is often a prenumbered form used in the accounts payable department to standardize and enhance a company's internal control over payments to its vendors and service providers.
Example of a Voucher
You could think of the voucher used in accounts payable as a cover sheet to which necessary supporting documents and approvals are attached. Some of the supporting documents include:

The vendor's invoice
The company's purchase order
The company's receiving report
Payee/vendor name
Discount terms
Amount and date to be paid
General ledger account numbers to be charged
Authorizing signatures

The voucher is then recorded in the voucher register.
The unpaid vouchers provide the detail for the total amount reported as vouchers payable or accounts payable.
As a voucher's payment date comes near, the voucher is forwarded to an authorized person for payment. After making payment, a copy of the check is attached and the voucher is stamped ""Paid.""  It is then filed in the paid voucher file in order to prevent a duplicate payment.",what
What is a trade discount?,"Definition of Trade Discount
A trade discount is a routine reduction from the regular, established price of a product. The use of trade discounts allows a company to vary the final price based on each customer's volume or status.
Note that trade discounts are different from early-payment discounts. (Early-payment discounts of 1% or 2% are usually recorded by the seller in an account such as Sales Discounts and by the buyer using the periodic inventory method in an account such as Purchase Discounts.) Trade discounts are not recorded in a separate account by either the seller or the buyer.
Example of Trade Discounts
A distributor of merchandise may have a single catalog which displays a single price for each product. However, the distributor allows a trade discount from the catalog price based on each customer's volume. For example, one product may have a catalog price of $100. A casual buyer will be charged $100. However, a reseller will be given a trade discount of 20% from the catalog price, and will be charged $80. Lastly, a registered high-volume wholesaler will be given a trade discount of 27% and will be charged $73.
Recording Sales Having a Trade Discount
The company selling the product (and the buyer of the product) will record the transaction at the amount after the trade discount is subtracted. For example, when goods with list prices totaling $1,000 are sold to a wholesaler that is entitled to a 27% trade discount, both the seller and the buyer will record the transaction at $730. There will not be a general ledger account entitled Trade Discount.",what
What is a bill payable?,"Definition of Bill Payable
A bill payable is a document which shows the amount owed for goods or services received on credit (meaning not paid at the time that the goods or services were received). The provider of the goods or services is referred to as the supplier or vendor. Hence, a bill payable is also known as an unpaid vendor invoice.
Examples of Bills Payable
Examples of a bill payable include a monthly telephone bill, the monthly bill for the electricity used, a bill for repairs that were completed, the bill for merchandise purchased by a retailer on credit, etc. 
Recording a Bill Payable
Under the accrual method of accounting or bookkeeping, a bill payable or unpaid vendor invoice is recorded in Accounts Payable with a credit entry. (The debit will likely be recorded as an expense or asset.) When the bill is paid, Accounts Payable will be reduced with a debit entry, and Cash will be decreased with a credit entry.
The credit balance in Accounts Payable is reported on the company's balance sheet as a current liability.",what
What is an account payable?,"Definition of an Account Payable
An account payable is an amount owed to a supplier or vendor for goods or services that were provided in advance of payment. However, some people use the term only if the amount is already recorded in the general ledger account Accounts Payable. (Until it is, they refer to the amount as one of the company's accrued liabilities.) For others, it is an account payable even if it is not yet recorded in Accounts Payable.
Example of an Account Payable
Assume that a corporation received repair services from Joe's Plumbing LLC on August 29. On August 31 the corporation receives an invoice from Joe's for $900. The invoice states that the $900 is due within 30 days. After reviewing and approving the invoice, the corporation enters Joe's invoice into its accounting records with a credit to Accounts Payable and debit to Repairs and Maintenance Expense.
Until the invoice from Joe's Plumbing Service is paid, Joe's invoice serves as a supporting document for the balance in the corporation's Accounts Payable. (The invoice is also a supporting document for the balance in Joe's Accounts Receivable.)",what
What is an early payment discount?,"Definition of Early Payment Discount
An early payment discount is a reduction in the amount on a supplier's invoice if the customer pays the supplier promptly. The early payment discount is also known as a cash discount. (The seller may refer to the early payment discount as a sales discount. The buyer may refer to the early payment discount as a purchases discount.)
Not all companies offer early payment discounts. If the discount is allowed it will appear on the sales invoice.
Examples of Early Payment Discounts
Let's assume that a company sells goods on credit and offers an early payment discount expressed as 1/10, net 30. This means that a customer is allowed to deduct 1% of the invoice amount, if payment is made within 10 days (instead of paying the full amount in 30 days). In other words, the customer saves 1% for paying 20 days early. Therefore, an invoice of $1,000 with terms of 1/10, net 30 means that the $1,000 obligation will be settled in full for $990 if it is paid within 10 days.
If the customer has adequate cash or a readily available line of credit, the 1% early payment discount for paying 20 days early equates to a very attractive annualized rate of approximately 18%. If the customer does not have cash or a credit line available, the early payment discount may not be worth the risk of a potential bank overdraft fee.",what
What is a liability account?,"A liability account is a general ledger account in which a company records its debt, obligations, customer deposits and customer prepayments, certain deferred income taxes, etc. that are the result of a past transaction. Common liability accounts under the accrual method of accounting include Accounts Payable, Accrued Liabilities (amounts owed but not yet recorded in Accounts Payable), Notes Payable, Unearned Revenues, Deferred Income Taxes (certain temporary timing differences), etc.
The balances in liability accounts are nearly always credit balances and will be reported on the balance sheet as either current liabilities or noncurrent (or long-term) liabilities.
The company with the liability account for the debt or payables is known as the debtor. The lenders, vendors, suppliers, employees, tax agencies, etc. who are owed the money are known as the company's creditors.",what
What is an irrevocable letter of credit?,"Definition of Irrevocable Letter of Credit
An irrevocable letter of credit is a financial instrument used by banks to guarantee a buyer's obligations to a seller. It is irrevocable because the letter of credit cannot be modified unless all parties agree to the modifications.
Irrevocable letters of credit are often used to facilitate international trade because of the additional risks involved. The irrevocable letter of credit assures the seller that it will be paid by the bank if the buyer fails to pay.
Also see our related post: What is a letter of credit?
Note that the irrevocable letter of credit is different from a line of credit.",what
What is a vendor?,"A vendor is a person or business that supplies goods or services to a company. Another term for vendor is supplier.
In many situations a company presents the vendor with a purchase order stating the goods or services needed, the price, delivery date, and other terms. Generally, when the vendor delivers the goods or services it will also send an invoice to the company. The company should then match the vendor's invoice with its purchase order and receiving report. If the three documents are in agreement, the company can than arrange for payment to the vendor.",what
What is accounts payable?,"Accounts payable may refer to:

A section of the accounting department that is responsible for processing vendor invoices and other bills for goods and services that a company received on credit.
The title of the current liability account containing the amounts owed for vendor invoices and other bills that have been approved but not yet paid. The balance in Accounts Payable is expected to be a credit balance.
Amounts owed which did not involve a promissory note. If a promissory note is involved, the account Notes Payable will be used instead of Accounts Payable.

If the company owes for goods and services and the amounts are not yet recorded in Accounts Payable, they must be entered with an adjusting entry at the end of the accounting period. The credit portion of the adjusting entry is likely to be recorded in a separate current liability account such as Accrued Expenses and Liabilities.
Accounts payable may also be referred to as trade payables.
To learn more about the various aspects of accounts payable, see our Explanation, Quiz, Q&A, and more.",what
What are accrued liabilities?,"Definition of Accrued Liabilities
Accrued liabilities are usually expenses that have been incurred by a company as of the end of an accounting period, but the amounts have not yet been paid or recorded in the general ledger.
Accrued liabilities are recorded at the end of the accounting period by means of  adjusting entries. The amounts for some accrued liabilities and their related expenses (or losses) may have to be estimated.
Examples of Accrued Liabilities
Some examples of accrued liabilities include the following:

Services and purchases that have been received, but the vendors' invoices have not yet been recorded in Accounts Payable
Accrued employee wages and fringe benefits
Accrued management bonuses
Accrued interest on loans payable
Accrued advertising and promotion
Accrued product warranty costs",what
Why does an increase in accounts payable appear as an addition on the statement of cash flows?,"Adjustments from Accrual to Cash
When the statement of cash flows (SCF, cash flow statement) is prepared using the indirect method, it begins with the company's net income for the accounting period. If the income statement was prepared using the accrual method of accounting, the  net income must be adjusted for

expenses that were not paid during the current accounting period
revenues which did not result in cash receipts in the current period

Accounts Payable Increases When Bills Are Not Paid
If the balance in a company's Accounts Payable account has increased, accountants will assume that the company did not pay for all of the expenses that were included in the current period's income statement. As a result, the company's cash balance should have increased by more than the reported amount of net income.
SCF Adjustment for an Increase in Accounts Payable
To illustrate, assume that the income statement reports $20,000 of revenues, $15,000 of expenses, and the resulting net income of $5,000. If the company's accounts payable had increased by $900, the company must not have paid for $900 of the expenses reported on the income statement. Therefore, the company's cash balance would increase by $5,900. Expressed differently, the revenues of $20,000 minus the $14,100 of cash paid for expenses ($15,000 minus the $900 of expenses not yet paid) means an increase in cash of $5,900. Hence, the positive adjustment of $900 converts the accrual accounting net income of $5,000 to be the cash amount of $5,900.
An Increase in Accounts Payable is Favorable for a Company's Cash Balance
It may help to view the positive amounts on the SCF as being favorable or good for a company's cash balance. An increase in accounts payable is a positive adjustment because not paying those bills (which were included in the expenses on the income statement) is good for a company's cash balance.",what
What is a blank check?,"A blank check often refers to a check that has been signed by an authorized check signer before the other information (date, payee, amount) has been entered on the check. For instance, a small business owner may sign three blank checks before leaving for a seven day vacation. Basically the owner is trusting that the employee holding these checks will enter the information required to make up to three business payments in the owner's absence. This is obviously poor internal control since the employee is able to issue the check for any amount and to any person. In addition these blank checks must be stored in a very secure place since anyone else could also complete the check information.
A blank check could also refer to the completely blank checks that are received from a check printing company. These blank checks do not yet have an authorized signature and are sometimes referred to as check stock. These checks should be stored in a secure place until they are inserted into the company's printer in order to pay its suppliers, etc.
Lastly, blank check sometimes indicates that a large, uncertain amount has been authorized in order to accomplish something. For example, a rich grandparent might indicate that an only grandchild will have a blank check as far as the cost of education.",what
What does drop ship mean?,"One example of drop ship is a manufacturer shipping goods directly to one of its customers' customer (instead of delivering the goods to the customer that placed the order with the manufacturer). The following illustrates the concept of drop ship, drop shipping or a drop shipment.
Assume that XYZ Distributors Inc (XYZ) sells only the Premier brand of water heaters. XYZ receives an order for 40 of the water heaters from a condominium developer located 30 miles away. XYZ then places an order for 40 water heaters from Premier Manufacturing Corp. However, XYZ instructs Premier to deliver them directly to the condo project. So instead of delivering them to XYZ's warehouse, Premier is asked to drop ship them to the condo project. The drop ship means that XYZ will not have to receive the water heaters, unload them, reload them onto its trucks and then deliver them to the condo project. Hence the drop ship allows XYZ to avoid some expensive non-value-added activities.
When Premier ships the water heaters, it will bill XYZ and will send the invoice to XYZ. As a result XYZ will have a purchase and an account payable for the amount charged by Premier. XYZ will prepare its own sales invoice to bill the condo developer.",what
What are invoice payment terms?,"A sales invoice will specify when the purchaser, customer, or client must pay for the goods or services that were (or will be) provided by the seller. Some of the more common payment terms include:

Due upon receipt
Net 30 days
2/10, net 30 days
1/10, net 30 days

In regards to the payment terms, the word net means the invoice amount minus any sales returns and/or sales allowances approved by the seller. For instance, if some of the goods received by the purchaser were damaged, the seller is likely to grant a sales allowance. Therefore, if the sales invoice is $2,100 and the seller granted the purchaser a $100 sales allowance, the net amount owed to the seller is $2,000.
The first two terms listed above do not permit the purchaser to take a discount for paying quickly. The remaining two terms communicate that a discount is offered if the purchaser pays within 10 days instead of paying in 30 days. (This discount is known as an early payment discount, a sales discount, or a cash discount.) For example, if an invoice states that the payment terms are 2/10, net 30 days it means that the purchaser may deduct 2% from the net amount owed, but only if the payment is made within 10 days of the invoice date (or perhaps within 10 days after the purchaser receives the invoice). Hence, if the sales invoice is $2,100 and the seller grants a $100 sales allowance, the net amount or $2,000 is due within 30 days. However, the 2/10, net 30 days allows the purchaser to deduct $40 (2% times the net amount of $2,000) if the purchaser remits $1,960 within 10 days. [When the terms are 1/10, net 30 days the purchaser can deduct 1% of the net amount if the amount is remitted within the discount period of 10 days.]
Not all sellers offer discounts for early payments. When sellers do offer the early payment discounts, generally they record the invoice amount as a credit to the Sales account and a debit to Accounts Receivable. If the purchaser remits the amount due within the discount period, the seller will 1) debit Cash for the amount received, 2) debit Sales Discounts for the allowed amount of the early payment discount, and 3) will credit Accounts Receivable for the total of the two debits (which should be the amount of the invoice).",what
What is the net method?,"In accounting and bookkeeping, the net method often refers to how a company records each vendor invoice. Under the net method, the company will credit Accounts Payable for the invoice amount minus any early payment discount that is offered. For example, if a vendor's invoice for $1,000 has credit terms of 2/10, net 30 days, the company will record the invoice at the net amount of $980 ($1,000 minus 2% of $1,000). In this example, Accounts Payable will be credited for $980 and another account (Inventory, Purchases, etc.) will be debited for $980. 
If the company's policy is to pay all vendor invoices within the discount period, the net method will result in a more precise current liability on its balance sheet. It will also mean that the accounts and amounts recorded as debits will better reflect the historical cost principle.
If the company fails to remit the net amount within the discount period, the net method requires a debit entry to the expense Purchase Discounts Lost. In our example, if the company pays the invoice in 30 days, it is not entitled to the early payment discount and will therefore have to credit Cash for $1,000. The debit amounts will be Accounts Payable for $980 and Purchase Discounts Lost for $20. Any amount recorded in Purchase Discounts Lost informs management that its policy of paying within the discount period has been violated.
Although the net method is theoretically better, it seems to be less efficient than recording vendor invoices at their stated amounts.",what
What is purchase discounts lost?,"The account Purchase Discounts Lost is found in the general ledger of a company that records vendors' invoices using the net method. An amount is entered in Purchase Discounts Lost only when the company fails to pay an invoice within the vendor's discount period.
To illustrate the net method and Purchase Discounts Lost, let's assume that a retailer's policy is to always pay a vendor's legitimate invoice within its discount period if the invoice offers an early payment discount. Let's also assume that one vendor's invoice is for $1,000 and has terms of 2/10, net 30 days. After reviewing and approving the invoice, the retailer will debit Purchases (or Inventory) for $980 ($1,000 minus 2% discount) and will credit Accounts Payable for $980.
If the retailer pays the vendor $980 within the 10-day discount period, it will be recorded with a debit to Accounts Payable for $980 and a credit to Cash for $980. However, if the retailer fails to pay the invoice within the discount period, the retailer will need to remit $1,000 to the vendor. In that case the retailer will credit Cash for $1,000; debit Accounts Payable for $980; and debit Purchase Discounts Lost for $20. Purchase Discounts Lost is considered to be an expense (as opposed to being a cost of the goods). The cost of the goods remains at $980 (the cash price) because in accounting cost is defined as cash or the cash equivalent amount. The $20 is viewed as interest expense or a financing charge since the retailer was apparently unable to remit the cash price of $980 within the discount period.",what
What is annualizing?,"Definition of Annualizing
Annualizing means taking a partial year amount and converting it to a full year amount. We will use several examples to illustrate how this works.
Examples of Annualizing

A person having a monthly salary of $4,000 is earning an annualized salary of $48,000 ($4,000 per month multiplied times 12 months in a year).
A person with a semimonthly salary of $3,000 is earning an annualized salary of $72,000 ($3,000 multiplied times 24 semimonthly pay periods).
A company having to pay an interest charge of 1.5% per month on its unpaid bills is experiencing an annualized interest rate of 18% (1.5% per month multiplied times 12 months).
A vendor's invoice having an early payment discount of ""1/10, net 30"" means that 1% can be saved if the amount owed is remitted within 10 days instead of the required 30 days. This 1% savings for paying 20 days early can be annualized by multiplying both the 1% and the 20 days by ""18"" to arrive at an annualized rate of approximately 18%.
A vendor's invoice having an early payment discount of ""2/10, net 30"" means that 2% can be saved if the amount is remitted within 10 days instead of the required 30 days. This 2% savings for paying 20 days early can be annualized by multiplying both the 2% and the 20 days by ""18"" to arrive at the annualized rate of approximately 36%. An annualized interest rate of 36% for a ""riskless investment"" of the amount owed is an amazing opportunity (as is an annualized rate of 18%). It also indicates that a company without sufficient cash to pay within the early payment discount period will experience a huge opportunity cost.",what
What is the difference between accounts payable and accounts receivable?,"Definition of Accounts Payable
Accounts payable is a current liability account in which a company records the amounts it owes to suppliers or vendors for goods or services that it received on credit.
Definition of Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable is a current asset account in which a company records the amounts it has a right to collect from customers who received goods or services on credit.
Examples of Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable
Let's assume that Company A sells merchandise to Company B on credit (with payment due 30 days later). Company A will record the amount of the sale with a credit to Sales and a debit to Accounts Receivable. Company B will record the purchase (perhaps as inventory) with a credit to Accounts Payable.
When the amount of the credit sale is remitted, Company B will debit its liability Accounts Payable and will credit Cash. Company A will debit Cash and will credit its current asset Accounts Receivable.
Symmetry with Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable
Our examples show that there are two sides to every transaction (which some people refer to as symmetry).
At the time of the sale:

Company A reported a sale and a current asset, and
Company B reported a purchase and a current liability

At the time of payment:

Company A's Cash increased and its Accounts Receivable decreased
Company B's Cash decreased and its Accounts Payable decreased

Balance Sheet: Retail/Wholesale - Corporation",what
What is accounts receivable?,"Definition of Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable is the amount owed to a company resulting from the company providing goods and/or services on credit. The term trade receivable is also used in place of accounts receivable.
The amount that the company is owed is recorded in its general ledger account entitled Accounts Receivable. The unpaid balance in this account is reported as part of the current assets listed on the company's balance sheet. 
When goods are sold on credit, the seller is likely to be an unsecured creditor of its customer. Therefore, the seller should be cautious when selling goods on credit.
Good accounting requires that an estimate should be made for any amount in Accounts Receivable that is unlikely to be collected. The estimated amount is reported as a credit balance in a contra-receivable account such as Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. This credit balance will cause the amount of accounts receivable reported on the balance sheet to be reduced. Any adjustment to the Allowance account will also affect Uncollectible Accounts Expense, which is reported on the income statement.
Example of Accounts Receivable
A manufacturer will record an account receivable when it delivers a truckload of goods to a customer on June 1 and the customer is allowed to pay in 30 days. From June 1 until the company receives the money, the company will have an account receivable (and the customer will have an account payable).",what
What is the purpose of control accounts?,"Definition of Control Account
A control account is a general ledger account containing only summary amounts. The details for each control account will be found in a related (but separate) subsidiary ledger.
The control account keeps the general ledger free of details, but still has the correct balance for preparing the company's financial statements.
Example of Control Accounts
A common example of a control account is the general ledger account entitled Accounts Receivable. When it is used as a control account, it will contain only summary amounts, such as total credit sales for a day, total collections from customers for a day, total returns and allowances for a day, and the total amount owed by all customers.
Hence, if you want to find the amount that a specific customer still owes for its purchases on credit, it will not be shown in the control account. To find the amount that a specific customer owes, its recent payments, and its recent purchases on credit, you will quickly get that information from the Accounts Receivable Subsidiary Ledger.
Control accounts could also be used for accounts payable, equipment, and inventory.",what
What is the provision for bad debts?,"Definition of Provision for Bad Debts
The provision for bad debts could refer to the balance sheet account also known as the Allowance for Bad Debts, Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, or Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts. If so, the account Provision for Bad Debts is a contra asset account (an asset account with a credit balance). It is used along with the account Accounts Receivable in order for the balance sheet to report the net realizable value of the company's accounts receivable. The entry to increase the credit balance in these contra accounts is a debit to the income statement account Bad Debts Expense.
Some companies might use the description provision for bad debts on its income statement in order to report the credit losses that pertain to the period of the income statement. In that case, provision for bad debts would be an income statement account. However, the U.S. accounting textbooks are more likely to use Bad Debts Expense or Uncollectible Accounts Expense to describe the amount reported on the income statement.",what
What does per annum mean?,"Definition of Per Annum
Per annum means yearly or annually. It is a common phrase used to describe an interest rate. Often ""per annum"" is omitted, as in ""I have a 4% mortgage loan."" or ""This bond pays interest of 6%.""
Example of Per Annum
An example involves a supplier offering a credit customer an early-payment discount of 2% for paying an invoice in 10 days instead of paying the full amount in 30 days. In this example the supplier is giving up 2% of the invoice amount in order to be paid 20 days early.
To compute the rate per annum we restate the amounts by multiplying both the ""2%"" and the ""20 days"" by 18 (in order to get close to the 365 days in a year). The result is a per annum rate of approximately 36%.
Another example involves a business charging its customers 1.5% per month on any past due balance. The monthly rate of 1.5% can be converted to 18% per annum by multiplying the 1.5% times 12 months in a year.",what
What is a contra asset account?,"Definition of Contra Asset Account
A contra asset account is an asset account where the account balance is a credit balance. It is described as ""contra"" because having a credit balance in an asset account is contrary to the normal or expected debit balance. (A debit balance in a contra asset account will violate the cost principle.)
Examples of Contra Asset Accounts
The most common contra asset account is Accumulated Depreciation. Accumulated Depreciation is associated with property, plant and equipment (plant assets). Accumulated Depreciation will be credited when Depreciation Expense is recorded. The credit balance in Accumulated Depreciation means that the cost of the property, plant and equipment will continue to be reported. Looking at the cost of the plant assets and the credit balance in Accumulated Depreciation allows us to see how much of the plant assets' cost has been depreciated and how much has not been depreciated.
Another contra asset account is Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. This account appears next to the current asset Accounts Receivable. The account Allowance for Doubtful Account is credited when the account Bad Debts Expense is debited under the allowance method. The use of Allowance for Doubtful Accounts allows us to see in Accounts Receivable the total amount that the company has a right to collect from its credit customers. The credit balance in the account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts tells us how much of the debit balance in Accounts Receivable is unlikely to be collected.
A less common example of a contra asset account is Discount on Notes Receivable. The credit balance in this account is amortized or allocated to Interest Income or Interest Revenue over the life of a note receivable.",what
What is a credit memo?,"Definition of Credit Memo
One type of credit memo is issued by a seller in order to reduce the amount that a customer owes from a previously issued sales invoice. Another type of credit memo, or credit memorandum, is issued by a bank when it increases a depositor's checking account for a certain transaction.
Example of a Credit Memo
Assume that SellerCorp had issued a sales invoice for $800 for 100 units of product that it shipped to BuyerCo at a price of $8 each. BuyerCo informs SellerCorp that one of the units is defective. SellerCorp will then issue a credit memo for $8.
The credit memo will result in the following entry in SellerCorp's accounting records: 1) a debit of $8 to Sales Returns and Allowances, and 2) a credit of $8 to Accounts Receivable. In other words, the credit memo reduced SellerCorp's net sales and its accounts receivable. 
When BuyerCo records the credit memo, the following will occur in its accounting records: 1) a debit of $8 to Accounts Payable, and 2) a credit of $8 to Purchases Returns and Allowances (or to Inventory).",what
What is the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts?,"Definition of Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
The Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is a balance sheet contra asset account that reduces the reported amount of accounts receivable. The use of this allowance account will result in a more realistic picture of the amount of the accounts receivable that will be turning to cash, since some customers may not pay the full amount owed to the company.
The credit balance in the allowance account is an estimate amount in an adjusting entry that debits the income statement account Bad Debts Expense and credits Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. While the allowance account is recommended for the company's financial statements, it is not acceptable for income tax purposes.
Example of the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Let's assume that a company has a debit balance in Accounts Receivable of $120,500 as a result of having sold goods on credit. Through the use of the aging method, the company sees that $18,000 of the receivables are 100 days past due. Upon further checking, the company believes that $10,000 of these receivables will never be collected. Thus, the account Allowance for Doubtful Account must have a credit balance of $10,000. If the present balance is $0, the journal entry will be a debit of $10,000 to Bad Debts Expense and a credit of $10,000 to Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.
The balance sheet will now report Accounts Receivable of $120,500 less the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts of $10,000, for a net amount of $110,500. The income statement for the accounting period will report Bad Debts Expense of $10,000.

What is the average collection period?,"Definition of Average Collection Period
The average collection period is the average number of days between 1) the dates that credit sales were made, and 2) the dates that the money was received/collected from the customers. The average collection period is also referred to as the days' sales in accounts receivable.
Formula for Calculating the Average Collection Period
One formula for calculating the average collection period is: 365 days in a year divided by the accounts receivable turnover ratio.
An alternate formula for calculating the average collection period is: the average accounts receivable balance divided by the  average credit sales per day.
Example of Average Collection Period
Assume that a company had on average $40,000 of accounts receivable during the most recent year. During that year the company had credit sales of $400,000.
One calculation of the average collection period is to first determine the accounts receivable turnover ratio, which is $400,0000 divided by $40,000 = 10 times per year. Since there were 365 days during the recent year, the average collection period is 365 days divided by the turnover ratio of 10 = 36.5 days.
Using the alternate formula we first determine the average credit sales per day, which is the $400,000 of credit sales divided by 365 days = $1,096. Next, the average accounts receivable balance of $40,000 is divided by the average credit sales per day of $1,096, which also results in 36.5 days.
The monitoring of the average collection period is one way to track a company's ability to collect its accounts receivable.",what
What is the days' sales in accounts receivable ratio?,"Definition of Days' Sales in Accounts Receivable
The days' sales in accounts receivable ratio (also known as the average collection period) tells you the number of days it took on average to collect the company's accounts receivable during the past year. 
Example of Calculating Days' Sales in Accounts Receivable
The days' sales in accounts receivable can be calculated as follows: the number of days in the year (use 360 or 365) divided by the accounts receivable turnover ratio during a past year. For example, if a company's accounts receivable turnover ratio for the past year was 10, the days' sales in accounts receivable was 36 days (360 days divided by the turnover ratio of 10).
Caution
The accounts receivable turnover ratio used above was calculated as follows:

The credit sales during the past year (cash sales are not included since they were not part of accounts receivable) divided by the next item...
The average accounts receivable balances during the past year

It is possible that within the average accounts receivable balances there are some receivables that are 120 days or more past due. These could easily be buried in the average if most customers are remitting the amounts by the dates the receivables are due. Therefore, it is best to review an aging of accounts receivable by customer to understand the detail behind the days' sales in accounts receivable ratio.",what
What is bad debts expense?,"Definition of Bad Debts Expense
Bad debts expense is related to a company's current asset accounts receivable. Bad debts expense is also referred to as uncollectible accounts expense or doubtful accounts expense. Bad debts expense results because a company delivered goods or services on credit and the customer did not pay the amount owed.
Examples of Bad Debts Expense
There are two methods for reporting the amount of bad debts expense:

direct write-off method
allowance method

The direct write-off method requires that a customer's uncollectible account be removed from Accounts Receivable and at that time the following entry is made: debit Bad Debts Expense and credit Accounts Receivable.
The allowance method  anticipates and estimates that some of the accounts receivable will not be collected. In other words, prior to knowing exactly which customers or clients will not be paying, the company will debit Bad Debts Expense and will credit Allowance for Doubtful Accounts for the estimated amount. (The Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is a contra asset account that when presented along with Accounts Receivable indicates a more realistic amount that will be turning to cash.)
For financial statement purposes the allowance method is the better method since 1) the balance sheet will be reporting a more realistic amount that will be collected from the company's accounts receivable, and 2) the bad debts expense will be reported on the income statement closer to the time of the related credit sales. However, for income tax purposes the direct write-off method must be used.",what
What is the accounts receivable turnover ratio?,"Definition of Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio
The accounts receivable turnover ratio is an important financial ratio that indicates a company's ability to collect its accounts receivable. Collecting accounts receivable is critical for a company to pay its obligations when they are due.
The calculation of the accounts receivable turnover ratio is: credit sales for a year divided by the company's average amount of accounts receivable throughout that year. Note that only the company's credit sales (or sales on credit) are used in the calculation, since cash sales do not involve accounts receivable.
Example of Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio
To illustrate the calculation of the accounts receivable turnover, let's assume that a company’s credit sales for the most recent year were $6,000,000 and its average amount of accounts receivable during that year were $600,000. As a result, the accounts receivable turnover ratio is: credit sales of $6,000,000 divided by the average amount of accounts receivable of $600,000 = 10 times a year. This indicates that on average the company’s accounts receivables turned over 10 times during the year, or approximately every 36 days (360 or 365 days per year divided by the turnover of 10).
Whether the accounts receivable turnover ratio of 10 is good or bad depends on the company's past ratios, the average for other companies in the same industry, and the specific credit terms given to the company's customers.
Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio is an Average
It is important to emphasize that the accounts receivable turnover ratio is an average, since an average can hide important details. For example, some past due receivables could be ""hidden"" or offset by receivables that have paid faster than the average. If you have access to the company's details, you should review a detailed aging of accounts receivable to detect slow paying customers.",what
What is bad debts?,"Definition of Bad Debts
The term bad debts usually refers to accounts receivable (or trade accounts receivable) that will not be collected. (Bad debts is also used for notes receivable that will not be collected.)
The bad debts associated with accounts receivable is reported on the income statement as Bad Debts Expense or Uncollectible Accounts Expense.
Examples of Recording Bad Debts
There are two methods for recording the bad debts associated with accounts receivable:

Direct write-off method, which removes the uncollectible amount directly from Accounts Receivable and records the amount as Bad Debts Expense
Allowance method, which estimates the likely amount that will not be collected, and immediately credits Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and debits Bad Debts Expense.",what
What is the purpose of subsidiary ledgers?,"Definition of Subsidiary Ledger
A subsidiary ledger contains the details to support a general ledger control account. For instance, the subsidiary ledger for accounts receivable contains the information for each of the company's credit sales to customers, each customer's remittance, return of merchandise, discounts, and so on. With these details in the subsidiary ledger, the Accounts Receivable account in the general ledger can report summary amounts for the accounts receivable activity.
Examples of Subsidiary Ledgers
By having the details of the accounts receivable activity in a subsidiary ledger, employees in a company's credit department of a company can access the credit sales information without having access to any information in the general ledger.
In job order costing systems, the job cost sheets (or job cost records) will serve as the subsidiary ledger containing the details for the general ledger account Work in Process. The Work in Process account will now be a control account containing summary amounts for direct materials, direct labor, factory overhead applied, transfers to finished goods, etc. Manufacturing personnel will have full access to the job cost sheets without having access to other information in the general ledger.
Since companies are integrating accounting records with their other information into one database, I assume there will be less use of the term subsidiary ledgers in the future. There will likely be reports generated to provide the information formerly contained in the subsidiary ledger.",what
What to do with the balance in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts?,"Definition of Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
The Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is a contra asset account that is used with the balance in Accounts Receivable to report the net realizable value of the receivables. 
Example of Adjusting the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
The balance in the account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts should be the estimated amount of the company's receivables that will not be turning to cash. For example, if the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts presently has a credit balance of $2,000 and you believe there is a total of $2,900 in Accounts Receivable that will not be collected, you need to enter an additional credit amount of $900 into the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. The other part of this adjusting entry will be a debit of $900 to Bad Debts Expense.
Note that some authors and companies may refer to the allowance account as Allowance for Uncollectible Expense, Allowance for Bad Debts or Provision for Bad Debts. The related income statement account could have the title of Uncollectible Accounts Expense, Doubtful Accounts Expense, etc.",what
How do you write off a bad account?,"Definition of the Write-off of a Bad Account
The write-off of a bad account usually refers to eliminating an account receivable due to the customer's inability to pay the amount owed.
The entry to write off a bad account depends on whether the company is using the direct write-off method or the allowance method.
Examples of the Write-off of a Bad Account
Under the direct write-off method a company writes off a bad account receivable when a specific account is determined to be uncollectible. This usually occurs many months after the credit sale occurred. The entry to write off the bad account under the direct write-off method is:

Debit Bad Debts Expense (to report the amount of the loss on the company's income statement)
Credit Accounts Receivable (to remove the amount that will not be collected)

.
In the U.S., the direct write-off method is required for income tax purposes, but is not the method to be used for a company's financial statements.
Under the allowance method a company anticipates that some of its credit sales and accounts receivable will not be collected and establishes an Allowance for Doubtful Accounts prior to knowing the specific account or accounts that will become uncollectible. The Allowance account is established and adjusted with the following journal entry:

Debit Bad Debts Expense, and
Credit Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

.
When a specific customer's account is identified as uncollectible, the journal entry to write off the account is:

A credit to Accounts Receivable (to remove the amount that will not be collected)
A debit to Allowance for Doubtful Accounts (to reduce the Allowance balance that was previously established)

Note that under the allowance method the write-off did not affect an income statement account. The income statement account Bad Debts Expense was affected earlier when the Allowance balance was established or adjusted.
For financial reporting purposes the allowance method is preferred since it means the loss (bad debts expense) is recognized closer to the time of the credit sales. This also means that the balance sheet will be reporting a lower, more realistic amount of its accounts receivable sooner.",what
What is a cash discount?,"Definition of Cash Discount
A cash discount is a deduction allowed by some sellers of goods or by some providers of services in order to motivate customers to pay within a specified time. The cash discount is also referred to as an early payment discount.
The sellers and providers offering a cash discount will refer to it as a sales discount, while the buyer will refer to the same discount as a purchase discount.
Examples of a Cash Discount
Let's assume that a company offers a cash discount and it is printed on its sales invoices as 1/10, net 30. Let's also assume that a sales invoice is for $1,000 and the buyer has been authorized to return $100 of goods. Therefore, the net amount due to the seller within 30 days is $900. However, the buyer may deduct $9 (1% of $900) if the buyer pays the seller $891 within 10 days of the invoice date. The seller will usually record the $9 cash discount with a debit to the account Sales Discounts. The buyer will record the $9 savings as a credit to Purchase Discounts or as a reduction to the cost recorded in inventory.
My dentist offers a 5% cash discount if the dental fee is paid on the day of the service. This discount is offered to avoid the expenses of billing, mailing statements for unpaid amounts, processing partial payments, not collecting amounts owed, etc. The dentist and others accept credit card payments and pay a fee to a credit card processor in order to avoid similar expenses.",what
What is a trade discount?,"Definition of Trade Discount
A trade discount is a routine reduction from the regular, established price of a product. The use of trade discounts allows a company to vary the final price based on each customer's volume or status.
Note that trade discounts are different from early-payment discounts. (Early-payment discounts of 1% or 2% are usually recorded by the seller in an account such as Sales Discounts and by the buyer using the periodic inventory method in an account such as Purchase Discounts.) Trade discounts are not recorded in a separate account by either the seller or the buyer.
Example of Trade Discounts
A distributor of merchandise may have a single catalog which displays a single price for each product. However, the distributor allows a trade discount from the catalog price based on each customer's volume. For example, one product may have a catalog price of $100. A casual buyer will be charged $100. However, a reseller will be given a trade discount of 20% from the catalog price, and will be charged $80. Lastly, a registered high-volume wholesaler will be given a trade discount of 27% and will be charged $73.
Recording Sales Having a Trade Discount
The company selling the product (and the buyer of the product) will record the transaction at the amount after the trade discount is subtracted. For example, when goods with list prices totaling $1,000 are sold to a wholesaler that is entitled to a 27% trade discount, both the seller and the buyer will record the transaction at $730. There will not be a general ledger account entitled Trade Discount.",what
Is the provision for doubtful debts an operating expense?,"Definition of Provision for Doubtful Debts
Some companies use Provision for Doubtful Debts as the name of the contra-asset account which is reported on the company's balance sheet. Other companies use Provision for Doubtful Debts as the name for the current period's expense that is reported on the company's income statement.
If Provision for Doubtful Debts is the name of the account used for recording the current period's expense associated with the losses from normal credit sales, it will appear as an operating expense on the company's income statement. It may be included in the company's selling, general and administrative expenses.
[However, if the expense is associated with extending credit outside of a company's main selling activities, the credit loss will be reported as a nonoperating expense.]
Example of Provision for Doubtful Debts
Accounting textbooks avoid the use of the word ""provision"" and instead use the following terminology:

The contra-asset account associated with accounts receivable will have the account title Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.
The current period expense pertaining to accounts receivable (and its contra account) is recorded in the account Bad Debts Expense which is reported on the income statement as part of the operating expenses.",what
What is the meaning of aging?,"Definition of Aging
In accounting,  the term aging  is often associated with a company's accounts receivable. Accounts receivable arise when a company provides goods or services and allows the customer to pay 10 or 30 days later. If some customers do not honor the terms of the sale, the company can experience a temporary or even permanent cash flow problem. In order for the company to minimize these potential problems, a company is wise to routinely review an aging of accounts receivable. 
The aging of accounts receivable sorts the company's accounts receivables by customer and then by time since the sales invoice was issued. Generally, the older the unpaid sales invoice, the greater the likelihood of not collecting the full amount.
Since the aging of accounts receivable is a standard feature of accounting software, it is available with a click of the mouse. The aging is also useful for estimating the amount needed in the related account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.
Example of an Aging Report
The aging report lists each customer's name and its unpaid sales invoices that make up the account receivable balance. Then the amounts of each unpaid sales invoice are placed in one of six columns that appear to the right. The headings for those columns are: Current, 1-30 days past due, 31-60 days past due, 61-90 days past due, 91-120 days past due, and 120+ days past due. The aging of accounts receivable gives the company's management a valuable and easy-to-read report that highlights the customers with past due sales invoices. 
An aging can also be prepared for the company's accounts payable. The aging of accounts payable is based on the dates that the vendors' invoices are to be paid.",what
What is the difference between receivables and accounts receivable?,"Definition of Accounts Receivables
Accounts receivable are usually current assets that result from selling goods or providing services to customers on credit. Accounts receivable are also known as trade receivables.
Definition of Receivables
The term receivables sometimes refers to a company's accounts receivables. However, the term receivables could include both trade receivables and nontrade receivables.
Nontrade receivables exclude accounts receivable and may appear on the balance sheet as other receivables.
Examples of Nontrade Receivables
Some examples of nontrade or other receivables include:

Interest receivable
Income tax receivable
Insurance claims receivable
Receivables from employees",what
Why is there a difference in the amounts for Bad Debts Expense and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts?,"Amount Reported as Bad Debts Expense
The amount reported in the income statement account Bad Debts Expense pertains to the estimated losses from extending credit during the period shown in the heading of the income statement. The estimated amount of Bad Debts Expense could be based on:

A percentage of the company's credit sales during the period, or
The change in the total amount needed in the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts based upon the amounts customers owe on the company's accounts receivable
Amount Reported as Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
The balance reported in the balance sheet account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is the estimated amount of Accounts Receivable that will not be collected. The balance in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts could be based upon:

An aging of the detailed amounts in Accounts Receivable
The result of recording the credit part of the entries to Bad Debts Expense that were based on a percentage of credit sales

Example of Bad Debts Expense and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
To illustrate, let's assume that on December 31 a company had $100,000 in Accounts Receivable and its balance in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts was a credit balance of $3,000. As a result, the December 31 balance sheet will be reporting that $97,000 will be turning to cash. During the first 30 days of January the company does not have any other information on bad accounts receivable. However, on January 31 the company learns that an additional $1,000 of its accounts receivable may not be collected. Therefore, on January 31 the company will make an adjusting entry to debit Bad Debts Expense for $1,000 and to credit Allowance for Doubtful Accounts for $1,000. After this entry is recorded, the company's income statement for the month of January will report Bad Debts Expense of $1,000 and its January 31 balance sheet will report a credit balance in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts in the amount of $4,000.",what
What is the aging method?,"Definition of Aging Method
The aging method usually refers to the technique for estimating the amount of a company's accounts receivable that will not be collected. The estimated amount that will not be collected should be the credit balance in the contra asset account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. The debit balance in Accounts Receivable minus the credit balance in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts will result in the estimated amount of the receivables that will be converted to cash.
The aging method sorts each customer's unpaid invoices by invoice date into perhaps four columns:

Column 1 lists the invoice amounts that are not yet due
Column 2 lists the invoice amounts that are 1-30 days past due
Column 3 lists the invoice amounts that are 31-60 days past due
Column 4 lists the invoice amounts that are more than 61 days past due

Accounting software will likely have a feature that generates the aging of accounts receivable.
Example of Aging Method
Let's assume that a company's Accounts Receivable has a debit balance of $89,400. The aging method indicates that most of the customers are current. However, there are a few customers' invoices that are more than 60 days past due. Those past due accounts are reviewed closely and based on each customer's information it is estimated that approximately $7,400 of the $89,400 will not be collected. Therefore the credit balance in the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts must be $7,400. This will result in the balance sheet reporting Accounts Receivable (Net) of $82,000.",what
What is the effect on the income statement when the allowance for uncollectible accounts is not established?,"Definition of Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts
The Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts or Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is a contra asset account that reduces the amount of accounts receivable to the amount that is more likely be collected.
The income statement account Bad Debts Expense is part of the adjusting entry that increases the balance in the Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts.
Effect of No Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts
If a company's balance sheet does not reduce its accounts receivable debit balance with a credit balance in Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts, the company is communicating that it is not anticipating any bad debts expense relating to its existing accounts receivable. Hence, the income statement is delaying the reporting of bad debts expense on its income statement until an account receivable is actually written off as uncollectible.",what
What is an early payment discount?,"Definition of Early Payment Discount
An early payment discount is a reduction in the amount on a supplier's invoice if the customer pays the supplier promptly. The early payment discount is also known as a cash discount. (The seller may refer to the early payment discount as a sales discount. The buyer may refer to the early payment discount as a purchases discount.)
Not all companies offer early payment discounts. If the discount is allowed it will appear on the sales invoice.
Examples of Early Payment Discounts
Let's assume that a company sells goods on credit and offers an early payment discount expressed as 1/10, net 30. This means that a customer is allowed to deduct 1% of the invoice amount, if payment is made within 10 days (instead of paying the full amount in 30 days). In other words, the customer saves 1% for paying 20 days early. Therefore, an invoice of $1,000 with terms of 1/10, net 30 means that the $1,000 obligation will be settled in full for $990 if it is paid within 10 days.
If the customer has adequate cash or a readily available line of credit, the 1% early payment discount for paying 20 days early equates to a very attractive annualized rate of approximately 18%. If the customer does not have cash or a credit line available, the early payment discount may not be worth the risk of a potential bank overdraft fee.",what
What is the difference between revenues and receipts?,"Definition of Revenues
A company's revenues are amounts it has earned as the result of business activities such as selling merchandise or performing services. Under the accrual method of accounting, revenues are reported on the income statement in the period in which they are earned even though the dependable customers will pay the company 30 days later.
Example of Revenues
On June 10, a company sells $4,000 of goods to one of its best customers with credit terms of net 30 days. On June 10, the company has revenues of $4,000 which will be recorded with a debit of $4,000 to Accounts Receivable and a credit of $4,000 to Sales Revenues. 
Definition of Receipts
A company's receipts  refers to the cash that the company received.
Examples of Receipts
The following are some examples of receipts which are not revenues:

Borrowing $1,000 in cash from the bank
Collecting $4,000 from a sale that was recorded one month earlier
Disposing of a company vehicle and receiving cash that is equal to the vehicle's book value
Receiving $1,000 from an employee who had borrowed $1,000 from the company several weeks earlier
Receiving cash from an investor for new shares of the company's common stock

Example of Both a Revenue and a Receipt
When a company makes a $200 cash sale (or performs services for $200 of cash) the company has earned revenue of $200 and has a receipt of $200.",what
Why isn't the direct write off method of uncollectible accounts receivable the preferred method?,"Definition of Direct Write Off Method
Under the direct write off method of accounting for credit losses pertaining to accounts receivable, no bad debts expense is reported on the income statement until an account receivable is actually removed from the company's receivables.
Under the direct write off method there is no contra asset account such as  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. This means that the balance sheet is reporting the full amount of accounts receivable and therefore implying that the full amount will be converted to cash.
Reason Why the Direct Write Off Method is Not Preferred
The accounting profession does not prefer the direct method for the following reasons:

The accounts receivable are more likely to be reported on the balance sheet at an amount that is greater than the amount that will actually be collected
The bad debts expense resulting from having sold goods on credit will appear on the income statement only after the bad account is identified and removed from the company's accounts receivable. Hence, the bad debts expense is reported much later than would be the case under the allowance method.

[The Internal Revenue Service requires the direct write off method in order to prevent taxpayers from claiming a bad debts expenses based on an anticipated potential loss.]",what
What are sales discounts?,"Definition of Sales Discounts
Sales discounts (if offered by sellers) reduce the amounts owed to the sellers of products, when the buyers pay within the stated discount periods. Sales discounts are also known as cash discounts and early payment discounts.
Sales discounts are recorded in a contra revenue account such as Sales Discounts. Hence, its debit balance will be one of the deductions from sales (gross sales) in order to report the amount of net sales.
Example of Sales Discounts
To illustrate a sales discount let's assume that a manufacturer sells $900 of products and its credit terms are 1/10, n/30. This means that the buyer can satisfy the $900 obligation if it pays $891 ($900 minus $9 of sales discount) within 10 days. The alternative is for the buyer to pay $900 within 30 days.
If the buyer pays the $891 within 10 days, the seller will record the money received as follows:

Debit Cash for $891
Debit Sales Discounts for $9
Credit Accounts Receivable for $900",what
What is the accounts receivable collection period?,"The accounts receivable collection period is similar to the days sales outstanding or the days sales in accounts receivable.
To illustrate the accounts receivable collection period, let's assume a corporation had net credit sales of $360,000 during the past year and its accounts receivable balance was on average $40,000. The average credit sales per day were approximately $1,000 per day ($360,000 of annual credit sales divided by 360 or 365 days per year). The average accounts receivable balance of $40,000 divided by $1,000 of credit sales per day equals 40 days.
An alternative calculation is to use the accounts receivable turnover ratio. In our example, the accounts receivable ratio is 9 times per year ($360,000 of net credit sales divided by $40,000—the average accounts receivable balance). 360 days per year divided by the accounts receivable turnover of 9 equals 40 days.
Accounts Receivable Turnover Days Sales in Accounts Receivable
Balance Sheet: Retail/Wholesale - Corporation",what
How do you estimate the amount of uncollectible accounts receivable?,"One way to estimate the amount of uncollectible accounts receivable is to prepare an aging. An aging of accounts receivable lists every customer's balance and then sorts each customer's balance according to the amount of time since the date of the sale. For example, assume that all sales are made with terms of 30 days. Let's also assume that Customer A has an accounts receivable balance of $12,000—consisting of $8,000 that was sold 15 days ago and $4,000 that was sold 40 days ago.
The $8,000 will be entered into the column with the heading ""Current"" and $4,000 will be entered into the column with the heading ""1-30 days past due."" After the sorting/entering is done for each and every customer, the columns are summed. The ""Current"" column is likely to be collectible. However, the amounts in the column headed ""1-30 days past due"" might not be 100% collected. The amounts in the column with the heading ""31-60 days past due"" will have a higher probability of being uncollectible. The column ""61-90 days past due"" indicates a still greater likelihood of not being collected. And the amounts in the column ""More than 90 days past due"" will be even less likely to be collected in their entirety.
Examining the details of each of the past due accounts will help you estimate the amount that will likely be uncollectible.
Another way to estimate the amount of uncollectible accounts is to simply record a percentage of credit sales. For example, if your company and its industry has a long run experience of 0.2% of credit sales being uncollectible, you might enter 0.2% of each period's credit sales as a debit to Bad Debt Expense and a credit to Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.",what
What is the entry when a contract is signed?,"Accounting Entry When Signing a Contract
Merely signing a contract does not by itself require a journal entry. In other words, signing a contract for a future transaction does not mean the company is increasing or decreasing an asset or a liability at the time of the signing. Of course, if cash or some other asset is exchanged at the time of the signing, it will have to be recorded.
While a journal entry is not required at the time the contract is signed, significant commitments that are contained in the contract must be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements of the parties to a noncancelable contract.
Examples of No Entry When Signing a Contract
Assume that an electric utility signs a noncancelable contract with a coal company to purchase 100 million tons of coal to be delivered over a one-year period that will begin in three months. On the day the contract is signed, the electric utility does not own any of the coal specified in the contract, nor does it owe for any of the coal, since the coal will not be delivered for at least three months. When the first trainload of coal arrives at the electric utility at least three months later, the utility will record the purchase of only the coal that has arrived and the related account payable.
Likewise, on the day the contract is signed, the coal company does not have a sale of the coal specified in the contract, and it does not have a receivable from the electric utility. Three months later, when the first shipment of coal is delivered to the utility, the coal company will record a sale of the coal and a related account receivable.
If the commitments made by the utility and the coal company are significant, those commitments must be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements of both the utility and the coal company.",what
What is a post-dated check?,"Definition of a Post-dated Check
A post-dated check (or post-dated cheque) is a check written with a future date. In other words, the date that appears on the check is after the date when the check was written. Even with a future date appearing on the check, the check could clear (be paid from) the bank account prior to that date.
Post-dating a check makes sense only if you are certain that the payee will not cash or deposit the check before the date appearing on the check.
Example of a Post-dated Check
To illustrate, let's assume that on May 22 Jim owes a supplier $2,000 for purchases made 40 days ago. Since Jim does not have the money to pay the supplier, he offers to mail the supplier two $1,000 checks: one check dated for June 20 and the other check dated for July 20. 
The supplier agrees to hold the checks and deposit them on the dates shown on the checks. Jim assures the supplier that the checks will be paid by his bank on those dates.
On June 4, when the supplier receives Jim's postdated checks, the supplier should not debit cash nor credit accounts receivable. The reason is that the checks cannot be turned into cash prior to the dates shown on the checks.",what
Does collecting a customer's accounts receivable affect net income?,"Collecting accounts receivable that are in a company's accounting records will not affect the company's net income. (Generally speaking, net income is revenues minus expenses.)
Under the accrual basis of accounting, revenues and accounts receivable are recorded when a company sells products or earns fees by providing services on credit. At the point of delivering the goods or services, the company debits Accounts Receivable and credits Sales Revenues or Service Revenues. When an account receivable is collected 30 days later, the asset account Accounts Receivable is reduced and the asset account Cash is increased. No revenue account is involved at the time of collection.
Your question brings to light the difference between a receipt and a revenue. Cash receipts from collecting accounts receivable or from the proceeds of a bank loan are not revenues. Revenues are amounts that companies earn through their operations by selling products or providing services (whether or not cash is received at the time of the sale or service).",what
What is the difference between bad debt and doubtful debt?,"Some people will use these terms or account titles interchangeably: Bad Debt Expense, Doubtful Account Expense, Uncollectible Account Expense. The same for these terms or account titles: Allowance for Bad Debts, Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts.
The ""Allowance for ..."" is a balance sheet account. However, it is a contra account to the asset Accounts Receivable. (Generally, the Allowance account will have a credit balance—whereas Accounts Receivable and other asset accounts normally have debit balances.) The Allowance account communicates to the reader of the balance sheet the amount of Accounts Receivable that will likely not be collected.
The three Expense account titles listed above are income statement accounts and will have the usual debit balance. These expense accounts report how much bad debt expense was incurred during the period shown in the heading of the income statement.

What is the purpose of the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts?,"The Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is used when Bad Debt Expense is recorded prior to knowing the specific accounts receivable that will be uncollectible. For example, a company might have 500 customers purchasing on credit and they owe the company a total of $1,000,000. The $1,000,000 is reported on the company's balance sheet as accounts receivable.
The company doesn't know specifically which customer will not pay, but it estimates that a few customers out of the 500 will not be paying the full amount they owe. The company estimates that $10,000 will not be collected. Rather than waiting until those specific customers are identified, the company makes an accounting entry that debits Bad Debt Expense and credits Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.
The amount of the entry will be the amount necessary to get the ending balance in the Allowance account to be a credit of $10,000. When the balance sheet is prepared, it will show Accounts Receivable of $1,000,000 less the Allowance of $10,000 for a net realizable value of $990,000—the amount that will likely be turned into cash.
The entry also meant that the income statement will be reporting $10,000 of Bad Debt Expense sooner than if the company waited for the customers to admit they were not able to pay. This means that the expense is matched more closely with the revenues—the goal of accounting's matching principle.
While this allowance method is good for financial reporting, it might not be allowed for income tax purposes. Be sure to check with a tax professional for the income tax rules.",what
What is the difference between reserve and provision?,"In the U.S. the use of the word reserve has been discouraged for several decades. In its place, the accounting profession has recommended the use of words such as allowance, accumulated, or provision. For instance, many years ago the contra account to a plant asset may have been titled Depreciation Reserve. To some readers, that name implied that cash had been set aside to replace the asset. To better communicate reality, the accounting profession recommended a more descriptive title such as Accumulated Depreciation. Similarly, the contra account to Accounts Receivable may have been titled Reserve for Bad Debts. Again, that title could imply that money was set aside. To avoid misinterpretation, the accounting profession suggested Allowance for Bad Debts or Provision for Bad Debts.
The word provision might appear in the title of a contra account as we just noted. In addition, provision will occasionally appear in the title of an expense account, such as Provision for Income Taxes.",what
What is income smoothing?,"Income smoothing refers to reducing the fluctuations in a corporation's earnings. Income smoothing can range from good business methods to fraudulent reporting.
Some business practices are ethical and will result in income smoothing. For example, a corporation might have an employee bonus plan, a deferred profit sharing plan, and a charitable giving plan that will result in expenses that total 25% of its pretax profits. In addition, a U.S. corporation might have a combined federal and state income tax rate of 40% on its incremental pretax profits. These examples will smooth income by causing huge expenses when profits are huge, and will result in little expense when profits are little. (Losses could actually result in a negative income tax expense.) In a year of low profits a corporation might eliminate jobs and postpone maintenance expenses. When profits are higher the corporation will add jobs and perform the maintenance that it had avoided.
The term income smoothing is more likely associated with the manipulation of earnings, creative accounting and the aggressive interpretation and application of generally accepted accounting principles. Perhaps a company will increase its allowance for doubtful accounts with a significant charge to bad debts expense in the years with high profits. Then in years of low profits, the company will reduce the allowance for doubtful accounts. Perhaps a U.S. manufacturer using LIFO will deliberately reduce its inventory quantities in low profit years in order to liquidate the old LIFO layers containing low unit costs. Other manufacturers might increase production when sales and profits are low in order to have lower unit costs.
Smoothing income by abusing the leeway in accounting principles is unethical and does a disservice to the users of the financial statements. Accountants should follow their general guidelines such as consistency, comparability, neutrality, full disclosure and conservatism.",what
What is a restrictive endorsement?,"A restrictive endorsement or restricted endorsement places a limitation on the use of a check or other negotiable financial instrument. The most common restrictive endorsement is the phrase For Deposit Only written along with the payee's signature on the back of a check. Other wording for a similar restrictive endorsement might be Pay to the Order of Sample Bank for deposit to account #xxxx followed by the payee's signature. Many companies endorse checks by using a rubber stamp containing this restriction.
Using a restrictive endorsement is one of many actions that a company can take in order to improve the internal control of its assets.",what
What is the allowance method?,"Definition of Allowance Method
The allowance method usually refers to one of the two ways for reporting bad debts expense that results from a company selling goods or services on credit. (The other way is the direct write-off method.)
Under the allowance method, a company records an adjusting entry at the end of each accounting period for the amount of the losses it anticipates as the result of extending credit to its customers. The entry will involve the operating expense account Bad Debts Expense and the contra-asset account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. Later, when a specific account receivable is actually written off as uncollectible, the company debits Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and credits Accounts Receivable.
The allowance method is preferred over the direct write-off method because:

The income statement will report the bad debts expense closer to the time of the sale or service, and
The balance sheet will report a more realistic net amount of accounts receivable that will actually be turning to cash

The allowance method can be applied in one or both of the following ways:

Focusing on the bad debts expense that is needed on the income statement
Focusing on the balance needed in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts (which will be reported on the balance sheet)

Examples of Allowance Method
Let's assume that a corporation begins operations on November 1 in an industry where it is common to give credit terms of net 30 days. In this industry approximately 0.3% of credit sales will not be collected.
Next, let's assume that the corporation focuses on the bad debts expense. If the corporation's actual credit sales for November are $800,000 it will record an adjusting entry dated November 30 to debit Bad Debts Expense for $2,400 ($800,000 X 0.003) and credit Allowance for Doubtful Accounts for $2,400. As a result, its November income statement will be matching $2,400 of bad debts expense with the credit sales of $800,000. If the balance in Accounts Receivable is $800,000 as of November 30, the corporation will report Accounts Receivable (net) of $797,600.
Focusing on the balance in the account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, the corporation will adjust the balance in the account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts so that the combination of that credit balance and the debit balance in Accounts Receivable will be equal to the amount that is expected to turn to cash. The expected amount will likely be determined by aging the accounts receivable.
If the corporation prepares weekly financial statements, it might focus on the bad debts expense for its weekly financial statements, but at the end of each quarter focus on the allowance account.",what
What is the direct write-off method?,"Definition of Direct Write-off Method
The direct write-off method is one of the two methods normally associated with reporting accounts receivable and bad debts expense. (The other method is the allowance method.)
Under the direct write-off method, bad debts expense is first reported on a company's income statement when a customer's account is actually written off. Often this occurs many months after the credit sale was made and is done with an entry that debits Bad Debts Expense and credits Accounts Receivable.
With the direct write-off method, there is no contra asset account such as Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. Therefore the entire balance in Accounts Receivable will be reported as a current asset on the company's balance sheet. As a result, the balance sheet is likely to report an amount that is greater than the amount that will actually be collected. It can also result in the Bad Debts Expense being reported on the income statement in the year after the year of the sale. For these reasons, the accounting profession does not allow the direct write-off method for financial reporting. Instead, the allowance method is to be used for the financial statements.
However, the direct write-off method must be used for U.S. income tax reporting. Apparently the Internal Revenue Service does not want a company reducing its taxable income by anticipating an estimated amount of bad debts expense (which is what happens when using the allowance method).",what
What is the difference between reserve and allowance?,"More than 60 years ago, accountants in the U.S. used Reserve for Bad Debts as the title of the contra account associated with Accounts Receivable or Loans Receivable. They also used Reserve for Depreciation as the title of the contra account associated with plant assets. The use of the word reserve led some readers of the financial statements to conclude that money was set aside for replacing plant assets or the uncollectible accounts or loans. To avoid this misunderstanding, the accounting profession recommended that the word reserve have a very limited use. Accountants now use Allowance for Doubtful Accounts or Allowance for Bad Debts instead of Reserve for Bad Debts. In the case of plant assets, Accumulated Depreciation is used in place of Reserve for Depreciation.",what
Where is a contract with a customer reported on the balance sheet?,"A contract to perform future services for a customer is not reported on the balance sheet of the company that will be providing the services.  For example, if Company Jay and one of its customers sign a contract in December agreeing that Company Jay will deliver $20,000 of services beginning in January, the contract is not reported on Company Jay's December 31 balance sheet. (If the customer makes a deposit of $3,000 at the time of signing the contract, the $3,000 will be recorded by Company Jay in December with a $3,000 debit to Cash and a $3,000 credit to the liability account Customer Deposits or Unearned Revenues. With no downpayment or advance payment in December, there is no entry recorded.)
The $20,000 contract is not reported as an asset on Company Jay's December 31 balance sheet. The reason is that Company Jay has not earned any of the contract amount and therefore does not have a right or a receivable to the $20,000 as of December 31. Similarly, Company Jay's income statement for December and its December 31 owner's equity cannot include any earnings associated with the contract.",what
What is a provision for discounts allowable?,"The provision for discounts allowable is likely to be a balance sheet account that serves to reduce the asset account Accounts Receivable. The provision account's counter part (remember double entry accounting) is an income statement account, such as Sales Discounts or Discounts for xxx.
Let me give you an example from the meat industry. We had 40,000 pounds of beef without a local customer, so we sold it to a company 1,000 miles away for the local price of say $1.50 per pound. Our accounting entry was to debit Accounts Receivable $60,000 and to credit Sales $60,000. We also knew that the beef would shrink approximately 800 pounds as it traveled in the refrigerated truck and that the customer would deduct $1,200 (800 pounds X $1.50) when the customer processed and paid our invoice. In order to more accurately report our Accounts Receivables, our Net Sales and our weekly profit, I immediately made an entry to debit Discount for Shrinkage (a contra account to Sales) and a credit to Provision for Discounts (a contra account to Accounts Receivable). By recording that entry, our balance sheet would report the true amount to be collected, $58,800 ($60,000 invoiced minus the anticipated deduction of $1,200). The income statement would report that Sales minus the discount were only $58,800.
The provision account allowed our Accounts Receivable to agree with our sales invoices, yet the balance sheet would report the net amount that we would realistically receive. It allowed us to ""match"" the discount to the week of the sale and not mismatch the discount to a later week when the customer remitted the reduced amount.",what
What if a company's Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is understated?,"When a company's Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is understated, the credit balance in this account is too small. This indicates that the company has reported too little of Bad Debts Expense and therefore too much net income.
Having a credit balance in the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts that is too small also means that the company is reporting too much for the following balance sheet items: net receivables, total current assets, working capital, total assets, and owner's equity.",what
How do you calculate the average balance in accounts receivable?,"The average will be more representative as you consider more daily balances in the computation. For example, if you compute the average balance for the year 2012 by using the balances from two days (December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012), you are ignoring the balances on the other 364 days of 2012. That's a problem if the majority of the company's activity occurs in the months of March through October. If that's the case, using only the December 31 balances will result in an average that is misleading.
To overcome the shortcoming of using the balance at the beginning of the year and the balance at the end of the year, some accountants use 13 balances: the balance at the beginning of the year plus the balances at the end of each month. For example, the 2012 average would be calculated using the ending balance on December 31, 2011 + the ending balance on January 31, 2012 + the ending balance on February 28, 2012 and so on. Obviously, this is better than using only the two December 31 balances. Of course you need to have access to the monthly balances.
Still better is to compute the average for the year by using the balances on each of the 365 days in the year—thereby considering fluctuations that occur within a month.
If you need a monthly average for accounts receivable, the logic is the same: 30 or 31 points of data is far better than merely using the beginning of the month balance and the end of the month balance.",what
What is meant by accounts written off?,"Accounts written off often refers to the accounts receivable that were deemed to be uncollectible and were removed from a receivable account in the general ledger. For example, a manufacturer may have written off an accounts receivable because a customer filed for bankruptcy and has insufficient assets. In this situation the account balance is written off with 1) a credit to Accounts Receivable, and 2) a debit to Allowance for Doubtful Accounts or Bad Debts Expense.
Banks, credit card companies, hospitals, and other organizations will also remove uncollectible accounts from their receivables and will refer to them as accounts written off.",what
Is a postdated check considered to be currency?,"A postdated check—a check with a date that is later than the current date—is not considered to be currency. Further, the postdated check should not be reported as part of the Cash account balance until the date of the check.
If the postdated check was received as payment on accounts receivable, the accounts receivable balance is not reduced until the date of the check.
To illustrate this, let's assume that on August 20 a company receives a $1,000 postdated check. The check is dated September 5 and represents the full payment on one of the company's accounts receivable. Since the postdated check is not considered to be money until the date of the check, the accounts receivable should not be reduced and cash should not be increased until September 5. Therefore, the company's August 31 balance sheet will report that the customer's $1,000 accounts receivable is still due.",what
What is net working capital?,"Definition of Net Working Capital
Net working capital is the amount (as opposed to being a ratio) remaining after subtracting a company's total amount of current liabilities from its total amount of current assets. Hence, the formula is: net working capital = current assets minus current liabilities. (Net working capital is also known as working capital.)
Example of Net Working Capital
As an example, a company with current assets of $130,000 and current liabilities of $100,000 has $30,000 of net working capital. This amount may be sufficient for some companies but inadequate for other companies.
Difference Between Net Working Capital and Liquidity
Net working capital is often cited as one of the indicators of a company's liquidity. However, the amount of net working capital alone does not assure a company of the liquidity necessary to pay its current liabilities when they come due. For example, if a company's current assets consist mainly of slow-moving inventory and some slow-paying accounts receivable, the company may not be able to convert its current assets to a sufficient amount of cash in time to pay its obligations. Not having sufficient cash to pay employees, suppliers and other creditors may lead to serious problems.
In contrast, another company that sells fast-moving products online with customers paying with credit cards will have liquidity even with a small amount of net working capital. If this company's suppliers also have credit terms of net 60 days or the company pays its bills by using its business credit card, the company may be able to operate with negative working capital.
Managing Working Capital
In short, net working capital management is critical for a company's positive relationships with lenders, suppliers, employees and customers. All of the components of net working capital should be examined in detail and managed properly.",what
What are invoice payment terms?,"A sales invoice will specify when the purchaser, customer, or client must pay for the goods or services that were (or will be) provided by the seller. Some of the more common payment terms include:

Due upon receipt
Net 30 days
2/10, net 30 days
1/10, net 30 days

In regards to the payment terms, the word net means the invoice amount minus any sales returns and/or sales allowances approved by the seller. For instance, if some of the goods received by the purchaser were damaged, the seller is likely to grant a sales allowance. Therefore, if the sales invoice is $2,100 and the seller granted the purchaser a $100 sales allowance, the net amount owed to the seller is $2,000.
The first two terms listed above do not permit the purchaser to take a discount for paying quickly. The remaining two terms communicate that a discount is offered if the purchaser pays within 10 days instead of paying in 30 days. (This discount is known as an early payment discount, a sales discount, or a cash discount.) For example, if an invoice states that the payment terms are 2/10, net 30 days it means that the purchaser may deduct 2% from the net amount owed, but only if the payment is made within 10 days of the invoice date (or perhaps within 10 days after the purchaser receives the invoice). Hence, if the sales invoice is $2,100 and the seller grants a $100 sales allowance, the net amount or $2,000 is due within 30 days. However, the 2/10, net 30 days allows the purchaser to deduct $40 (2% times the net amount of $2,000) if the purchaser remits $1,960 within 10 days. [When the terms are 1/10, net 30 days the purchaser can deduct 1% of the net amount if the amount is remitted within the discount period of 10 days.]
Not all sellers offer discounts for early payments. When sellers do offer the early payment discounts, generally they record the invoice amount as a credit to the Sales account and a debit to Accounts Receivable. If the purchaser remits the amount due within the discount period, the seller will 1) debit Cash for the amount received, 2) debit Sales Discounts for the allowed amount of the early payment discount, and 3) will credit Accounts Receivable for the total of the two debits (which should be the amount of the invoice).",what
What is the purpose of assigning accounts receivable?,"The purpose of assigning accounts receivable is to provide collateral in order to obtain a loan.
To illustrate, let's assume that a corporation receives a special order from a new customer whose credit rating is superb. However, the customer pays for its purchases 90 days after it receives the goods. The corporation does not have sufficient money to purchase the raw materials, pay for the labor, and then wait 90 days to collect the receivable. The corporation's bank or a finance company may lend 80% of the receivable but insists that the receivable be assigned to them as collateral for the loan.
Assigning a specific account receivable usually results in recording the receivable in a separate general ledger account such as Accounts Receivable Assigned. Some lenders require that the corporation's customer be notified of the assignment and that the customer must remit the receivable amount directly to the bank.
Instead of assigning a specific receivable, the lender may require the corporation to assign all of its receivable as collateral for a loan.",what
How does the aging of accounts receivable determine bad debts expense?,"The aging of accounts receivable allows you to quickly identify the credit customers that are past due and the length of time that the amounts have been past due. Focusing on the past due accounts receivable will assist you in estimating how much of the accounts receivable will never be collected.
The estimated amount of accounts receivable that will never be collected should be the credit balance in the general ledger account  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. This credit balance when combined with the debit balance in Accounts Receivable will mean that the amount that is likely to be collected will be reported on the balance sheet.
When the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is credited to increase its balance, the entry will debit the general ledger account Bad Debts Expense.",what
What is a blank endorsement?,"In the case of a check payable to John Smith (the payee), a blank endorsement would be the signature of John Smith on the back side of the check without any other words above or below his signature.
A blank endorsement is considered to be risky because the endorser is not restricting the check (or other negotiable instrument). The blank endorsement indicates that whoever is in possession of the endorsed check is considered to be the owner. To avoid such a risk, businesses and individuals should use restrictive endorsements on the checks they receive.",what
"If a customer pays for the same invoice twice, should the customer be informed?","I say yes. If you become aware of the double payment when posting the customer's second remittance, I would double check your records to be certain you are not owed money from the customer and would then inform the customer.  If the check was sent in error, I would photocopy the check, document on the photocopy what had occurred, and then return it to the customer.
If you did not notice the double payment when processing the customer's remittance, the customer's accounts receivable record will show a negative amount due for the sales invoice and might even show a negative amount due from the customer. If your company mails statements to its customers, the customer should be able to see its double payment when reviewing the statement.",what
What is a sale on credit?,"Definition of Sale on Credit
A sale on credit is revenue earned by a company when it sells goods and allows the buyer to pay at a later date. This is also referred to as a sale on account.
Normally, this means that the company selling the goods is transferring ownership of its goods to the buyer and in return has a current asset known as accounts receivable. One consequence is the seller becomes one of the buyer's unsecured creditors. This means that the seller has the risk of bad debts expense if the buyer does not pay the full amount owed to the seller.
Example of a Sale on Credit
Assume that a company is in an industry where it is necessary to give customers invoice payment terms of net 30 days. If the company sells $10,000 of goods to a customer with those terms, the company will debit Accounts Receivable for $10,0000 and will credit Sales for $10,000. When the company receives the $10,000 from the customer, the company will debit Cash for $10,000 and will credit Accounts Receivable for $10,000.",what
What is annualizing?,"Definition of Annualizing
Annualizing means taking a partial year amount and converting it to a full year amount. We will use several examples to illustrate how this works.
Examples of Annualizing

A person having a monthly salary of $4,000 is earning an annualized salary of $48,000 ($4,000 per month multiplied times 12 months in a year).
A person with a semimonthly salary of $3,000 is earning an annualized salary of $72,000 ($3,000 multiplied times 24 semimonthly pay periods).
A company having to pay an interest charge of 1.5% per month on its unpaid bills is experiencing an annualized interest rate of 18% (1.5% per month multiplied times 12 months).
A vendor's invoice having an early payment discount of ""1/10, net 30"" means that 1% can be saved if the amount owed is remitted within 10 days instead of the required 30 days. This 1% savings for paying 20 days early can be annualized by multiplying both the 1% and the 20 days by ""18"" to arrive at an annualized rate of approximately 18%.
A vendor's invoice having an early payment discount of ""2/10, net 30"" means that 2% can be saved if the amount is remitted within 10 days instead of the required 30 days. This 2% savings for paying 20 days early can be annualized by multiplying both the 2% and the 20 days by ""18"" to arrive at the annualized rate of approximately 36%. An annualized interest rate of 36% for a ""riskless investment"" of the amount owed is an amazing opportunity (as is an annualized rate of 18%). It also indicates that a company without sufficient cash to pay within the early payment discount period will experience a huge opportunity cost.",what
What is cost accounting?,"Definition of Cost Accounting
Cost accounting is involved with the following:

Determining the costs of products, processes, projects, etc. in order to report the correct amounts on a company's financial statements, and
Assisting management in the planning and control of the organization
Preparing special analyses that assists in making the best decisions

Examples of Cost Accounting
A significant part of cost accounting involves the unit cost of a manufacturer's products in order to report the cost of inventory on its balance sheet and the cost of goods sold on its income statement. This is achieved with techniques such as the allocation of manufacturing overhead costs and through the use of process costing, operations costing, and job-order costing systems.
Cost accounting assists management to plan and control the business through budgeting for operations, capital budgeting for expanding operations, standard costing and the reporting of variances, transfer pricing, etc.
Special analyses includes cost behavior, cost-volume-profit relationships, make or buy decisions, selling prices for products, activity-based costing, and more.
Cost accounting had its roots in manufacturing businesses. However, today it extends to service businesses. For example, a bank will use cost accounting to determine the cost of processing a customer's check and/or a deposit, maintaining a checking account, processing international wire transfers, servicing a mortgage loan, etc. This in turn may provide management with guidance in the pricing of various services.",what
What is cost allocation?,"Definition of Cost Allocation
Cost allocation is the assigning of a cost to several cost objects such as products or departments. The cost allocation is needed because the cost is not directly traceable to a specific object. Since the cost is not directly traceable, the resulting allocation is somewhat arbitrary. Because of the arbitrariness, some people describe cost allocation as the spreading of a cost.
Accountants have made efforts to improve the cost allocation techniques. Over time, manufacturers' overhead allocations have moved from a plant-wide rates to departmental rates. Some allocations that were allocated on the basis of direct labor hours are now based on machine hours. In order to improve those bases of allocations, some accountants are implementing activity based costing. The goal is to reduce the arbitrariness by identifying the various root causes of the overhead costs.
Examples of Cost Allocations
The following are only a few of the many cost allocations that occur in some companies or organizations:

The cost of a manufacturing building is allocated to each of the years that the building is expected to be used. Each year's depreciation is allocated to the departments that use the building. Each department's allocated cost is then allocated/assigned to the products that are processed in the department.
The electricity that is used in the production facility as measured by a single meter is allocated to the departments using the electricity. Each department's electricity is then allocated/assigned to the products processed in the department.
The cost of raw land that was purchased for $1 million is going to be developed into 80 residential lots of various sizes and 10 business lots of different sizes. The $1 million cost must be allocated to the resulting 90 lots in a meaningful way so that the developer can report the profit of selling two residential lots and the largest of the business lots. The basis for the allocation is likely to be the net realizable values of the lots.
The annual salary and benefits of an employee that spends time in three main functions of a nonprofit organization.",what
What is the traditional method used in cost accounting?,"The traditional method of cost accounting refers to the allocation of manufacturing overhead costs to the products manufactured. The traditional method (also known as the conventional method) assigns or allocates the factory's indirect costs to the items manufactured on the basis of volume such as the number of units produced, the direct labor hours, or the production machine hours. We will use machine hours in our discussion.
By using only machine hours to allocate the manufacturing overhead to products, it is implying that the machine hours are the underlying cause of the factory overhead. Traditionally, that may have been reasonable or at least sufficient for the company's external financial statements. However, in recent decades the manufacturing overhead has been driven or caused by many other factors. For example, some customers are likely to demand additional manufacturing operations for their diverse products. Other customers simply want great quantities of uniform products.
If a manufacturer wants to know the true cost to produce specific products for specific customers, the traditional method of cost accounting is inadequate. Activity based costing (ABC) was developed to overcome the shortcomings of the traditional method. Instead of just one cost driver such as machine hours, ABC will use many cost drivers to allocate a manufacturer's indirect costs. A few of the cost drivers that would be used under ABC include the number of machine setups, the pounds of material purchased or used, the number of engineering change orders, the number of machine hours, and so on.",what
What is a cost driver?,"Ideally, a cost driver is an activity that is the root cause of why a cost occurs.
In the past century, the root cause of indirect manufacturing costs has changed from a single cost driver (such as direct labor hours) to several cost drivers. Due to sophisticated manufacturing and increased demands from customers, direct labor is no longer the main cost driver of indirect manufacturing overhead.
In addition to direct labor, today's drivers of indirect manufacturing costs include the number of machine setups required, the number of engineering change orders, the demands from customers for special inspections, handling and storage, the number of components in the units produced, and the number of production machine hours.
Manufacturers that want to know the true costs of their products need to know what is driving their indirect manufacturing costs. For these companies it is not sufficient to merely spread overhead costs to products by using a single factor such as direct labor hours or production machine hours.",what
What are indirect manufacturing costs?,"Definition of Indirect Manufacturing Costs
Indirect manufacturing costs are a manufacturer's production costs other than direct materials and direct labor. Indirect manufacturing costs are also referred to as manufacturing overhead, factory overhead, factory burden, or burden.
US GAAP requires that indirect manufacturing costs be allocated to, assigned to, or absorbed by the manufacturer's output (in addition to the cost of direct materials and direct labor) for its external financial statements. This is known as absorption costing and must be used in determining a manufacturer's cost of goods sold and the cost of its inventory.
In traditional cost accounting, the indirect manufacturing costs are allocated to the products manufactured based on direct labor hours, direct labor costs, or production machine hours. However, in recent decades the indirect manufacturing costs have increased significantly and are less likely to be caused by the quantity of direct labor or production machine hours. (This may not be a problem for financial reporting when the amount of inventory is consistently small, but it can be a problem for pricing and other decisions.)
Examples of Indirect Manufacturing Costs
Some examples of indirect manufacturing costs include:

depreciation, repairs and maintenance, electricity, etc. for the production facilities and the production equipment
salaries, wages and fringe benefits of the indirect manufacturing personnel such as production supervisors, material handlers, quality assurance, and other factory support personnel
factory supplies, outside services pertaining to manufacturing, and other manufacturing related costs",what
What is a plant-wide overhead rate?,"A plant-wide overhead rate is a single rate used to assign or allocate all of a company's manufacturing overhead costs to its production output. (Manufacturing overhead costs are the indirect costs of production such as repairs, maintenance, depreciation, electricity, supervision, etc.) Often the plant-wide rate is an amount per machine hour, an amount per labor hour, or a percentage of a product's direct costs.
Using a plant-wide rate is logical when there is one root cause of the indirect production costs and the company manufactures similar products. For example, a company with a simple manufacturing operation that produces similar products could have a plant-wide overhead rate of $40 per machine hour if it has budgeted $800,000 of total manufacturing overhead costs and it expects to produce 20,000 machine hours of good output.
On the other hand, if the company manufactures diverse products, some of which use expensive equipment while some use only inexpensive equipment, a plant-wide rate is not appropriate. In response to this situation, manufacturers have developed departmental overhead rates. Thus, only the products that use the expensive equipment in a specific department will be assigned a higher overhead rate of perhaps $70 per departmental machine hour. The products requiring a simpler operation such as assembling may be assigned overhead at a rate of perhaps $20 per direct labor hour.
Some companies have moved beyond both the plant-wide rate and the departmental rates because they want to consider all of the activities that are driving up manufacturing overhead costs. These companies are attempting to find the root causes of the indirect manufacturing costs so they can assign the costs to products in a more logical manner (instead of merely spreading the costs arbitrarily via plant-wide or departmental production hours). This effort is known as activity based costing.",what
What is elastic demand?,"Definition of Elastic Demand
Elastic demand is the situation in which demand for a product or service is sensitive to price changes. 
Elastic demand is a major concern for a manufacturer that attempts to set a product's price based on the product's costs. For instance, if the manufacturer's production and sales have declined and it fails to cut fixed costs, the manufacturer could be worse off by increasing selling prices. It could even lead to a death spiral.
Examples of Elastic Demand
If the selling price of a product is increased, the number of units sold will decrease. If the selling price of a product is decreased, the number of units sold will increase. Elastic demand is also referred to as the price elasticity of demand.
[Inelastic demand means that the demand for a product is not sensitive to price changes.]",what
What is setup cost?,"Definition of Setup Cost
In manufacturing, setup cost is the cost incurred to get equipment ready to process a different batch of goods. Hence, setup cost is regarded as a batch-level cost in activity based costing.
Setup cost is considered to be a non-value-added cost that should be minimized.
Examples of Setup Costs
Setup costs include the following:

Costs of changing the tools or dies on the equipment
Preparing and moving materials or components to the equipment
Testing the initial output to be certain it meets the specifications

In addition to the out-of-pocket costs, such as the labor cost of setting up the equipment, there is also an opportunity cost. The opportunity cost of setting up the equipment is the lost opportunity to manufacture profitable output during the time that the equipment is being set up.",what
What is the coefficient of correlation?,"Definition of Coefficient of Correlation
In simple linear regression analysis, the coefficient of correlation (or correlation coefficient) is a statistic which indicates an association between the independent variable and the dependent variable. The coefficient of correlation is represented by ""r"" and it has a range of -1.00 to +1.00. 
When the coefficient of correlation is a positive amount, such as +0.80, it means the dependent variable is increasing when the independent variable is increasing. It also means that the dependent variable is decreasing when the independent variable is decreasing. However, a high positive correlation does not guarantee there is a cause and effect relationship. (A negative amount indicates an inverse association...the dependent variable is decreasing when the independent variable is increasing and vice versa.)
A coefficient of correlation of +0.8 or -0.8 indicates a strong correlation between the independent variable and the dependent variable. An r of +0.20 or -0.20 indicates a weak correlation between the variables. When the coefficient of correlation is 0.00 there is no correlation.
Relationship of Coefficient of Correlation to Coefficient of Determination
When the coefficient of correlation is squared, it becomes the coefficient of determination. This means that a coefficient of correlation of +0.80 will result in a coefficient of determination of 0.64 or 64%. (The coefficient of determination of 0.64 tells you that 64% of the change in the total of the dependent variable is associated with the change in the independent variable.) An r of +0.20 or -0.20 will result in an r-squared of only 4% (0.20 x 0.20), which means that only 4% of the change in the dependent variable is explained by the change in the independent variable.",what
What is the major weakness of the traditional method of allocating factory overhead?,"Under the traditional method of allocating factory overhead (manufacturing overhead, burden), most of the factory overhead costs are allocated on the basis of just one factor such as machine hours or direct labor hours. In other words, the traditional method implies there is only one driver of the factory overhead and the driver is machine hours (or direct labor hours, or some other indicator of volume produced).
In reality there are many drivers of the factory overhead: machine setups, unique inspections, special handling, special storage, and so on. The more diversity in products and/or in customer demands, the bigger the problem of allocating all the costs of these various activities via only one activity such as the production machine's hours.
Under the traditional method, the costs of performing all of the diverse activities will be contained in one cost pool and will be divided by the number of production machine hours. This results is one average rate that is applied to all products regardless of the number of activities and the complexity of those activities. Since the cost of many of the diverse activities do not correlate at all with the number of production machine hours, the resulting allocations are misleading.
Activity-based costing is intended to overcome the weakness of the traditional method by having various pools of costs and then allocating each pool's costs on the basis of its root cause.",what
What are semivariable costs?,"Semivariable costs are costs or expenses whose behavior is partially fixed and partially variable. Semivariable costs are also referred to as mixed costs.
A common example of a semivariable cost is the annual cost of operating a vehicle. Some of the vehicle's operating costs will vary with the number of miles driven while other costs will be the same in total regardless of the miles driven. For example, the vehicle's fuel costs will be variable. However, the depreciation, insurance and licensing may be fixed. Looking only at the vehicle's maintenance costs may indicate that some maintenance is done each November (regardless of the number of miles driven) while other maintenance is done every 6,000 miles.
A manufacturer's electricity cost is another example of a semivariable cost. Part of the monthly electricity bill will include 1) a fixed amount, and 2) a separate amount based on the number of kilowatt hours of electricity actually used by the company.
The manufacturer's electricity cost is also a semivariable cost in relationship with the company's machine hours. The portion of the electricity cost used to operate the production equipment is variable, but the portion of the electricity cost used for lighting and air conditioning the manufacturing facility is a fixed cost.
These simple examples illustrate that it can be difficult to understand how costs behave. There are many factors, activities, and drivers that influence the level of costs.",what
What is simple linear regression analysis?,"Simple linear regression analysis is a statistical tool for quantifying the relationship between just one independent variable (hence ""simple"") and one dependent variable based on past experience (observations). For example, simple linear regression analysis can be used to express how a company's electricity cost (the dependent variable) changes as the company's production machine hours (the independent variable) change.
Fortunately there is software to compute the best fitting straight line (hence ""linear"") that expresses the past relationship between the dependent and independent variable. Continuing our example, you will enter 1) the amount of the past monthly electricity bills, and 2) the number of machine hours occurring during the period of each of the bills. Next, the software will likely use the least squares method to produce the formula for the best fitting line. The line will appear in the form y = a + bx. In addition, the software will provide statistics regarding the correlation, confidence, dispersion around the line, and more.
(In all likelihood there are many independent variables causing a change in the amount of the dependent variable. Therefore, you should not expect that only one independent variable will explain a high percentage of the change in the dependent variable. To increase the percentage, you should think of the many independent variables that could cause a change in the dependent variable. Next you should test the effect of the combination of these independent variables or drivers by using multiple regression analysis software.)
Prior to using simple linear regression analysis it is important to follow these preliminary steps:

seek an independent variable that is likely to cause or drive the change in the dependent variable
make certain that the past amounts for the independent variable occur in the exact same period as the amount of the dependent variable
plot the past observations on a graph using the y-axis for the cost (monthly electricity bill) and the x-axis for the activity (machine hours used during the exact period of the electricity bill)
review the plotted observations for a linear pattern and for any outliers
keep in mind that there can be correlation without cause and effect",what
What is the death spiral?,"In cost accounting and managerial accounting, the term death spiral refers to the repeated elimination of products resulting from spreading costs on the basis of volume instead of their root causes. The death spiral is also known as the downward demand spiral.
To illustrate the death spiral let's assume that Product X is a simple, high-volume product that requires little manufacturing attention. If the accountant spreads the company's manufacturing overhead costs based on volume, Product X will appear to have high overhead costs. (In reality, Product X causes very little overhead cost especially when compared to the company's many complex, low-volume products.) If management responds to Product X's allocated high overhead costs and 1) seeks a price increase which causes the customer to move the production to a competitor with a lower price, 2) outsources the production, or 3) drops the product, then the company's manufacturing volume will decrease.
If the company does not reduce its fixed overhead to correspond to the decreased manufacturing volume and the accountant continues to spread the overhead costs—including the cost of excess capacity—on the basis of volume, the remaining products will have to be assigned more of the overhead costs. If management again reacts to the new, higher, allocated costs by seeking price increases which cause a loss of sales, outsources production, or drops the products, the company's manufacturing volume will again decrease. If fixed costs are not decreased accordingly and the accountant again spreads the overhead on the basis of a new, even smaller volume, the entire company could die from the high fixed costs and a small volume of products being produced and sold.
To avoid the death spiral, some companies attempt to allocate overhead costs based on activities and product complexities rather than simply spreading them on volume. Also, some companies do not allocate the costs of excess capacity to products in order to minimize the death spiral.",what
What is the coefficient of determination?,"The coefficient of determination is a statistic which indicates the percentage change in the amount of the dependent variable that is ""explained by"" the changes in the independent variables.
For example, a manufacturer may have found through simple linear regression analysis involving 15 monthly observations that 64% of the change in the total cost of electricity (the dependent variable) was associated with the change in the monthly production machine hours (the independent variable). In this example the coefficient of determination is 0.64 or 64%.
The coefficient of determination is symbolized by r-squared, where r is the coefficient of correlation. Hence, a coefficient of determination of 0.64 or 64% means that the coefficient of correlation was 0.8 or 80%. (The range for the coefficient of correlation is -1 to +1, and therefore the range for the coefficient of determination is 0 to +1.)
It is important to note that a high coefficient of determination does not guarantee that a cause-and-effect relationship exists. However, a cause-and-effect relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable will result in a high coefficient of determination.",what
How can a manufacturer determine the precise cost of its products?,"A manufacturer may never be able to determine the precise cost of its individual products. The reason is that most of the manufacturing costs (other than materials and some labor) are indirect costs. This means that most of the manufacturing costs are not directly traceable to individual products and will need to be allocated to them. Examples of indirect manufacturing costs include the rent, property taxes, depreciation, heat, lighting, indirect production workers pay and benefits, repairs, maintenance, and others that occur in the factory.
In addition to the manufacturing costs, there are selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses and perhaps interest expense. Generally, accountants do not consider these expenses to be product costs. As a result these expenses are reported on the income statement when they occur and without any allocation to the products. However, these expenses are associated with some or all of the products.
The manufacturer can attempt to calculate the costs and expenses of each of its products, but I don't think the result will be the true, precise cost. In addition to the allocations (which are viewed as arbitrary), consider that changes in volume will affect a product's cost. For example, if a company's total fixed costs remain constant but its volume of products decreases by 20%, the cost of each product will increase. If volume increases, the cost of each product will decrease.
Activity-based costing (ABC) is an attempt to improve the allocation of costs by identifying more of the root causes of the costs (rather than merely spreading costs to products based on machine hours). Even with ABC there will be arbitrary allocations which will prevent knowing each product's precise cost.",what
What is the weakness of traditional cost allocations?,"Traditional cost allocations are often based on volume such as number of products manufactured, number of direct labor hours, number of production machine hours, number of square feet, etc. Unfortunately, it is becoming more frequent that the common costs or indirect costs that require allocation are not caused by volume. In other words, traditional cost allocations are often based on something other than the root causes of the costs.
It is possible that a significant amount of manufacturing overhead might not be caused by production machine hours, yet the overhead is allocated using those hours. For example, a few of a manufacturer's low volume products may require significant amounts of engineering changes, additional inspections, frequent machine setups with unusually short production runs, special handling, additional storage, and so on. To allocate these special costs to all products on the basis of the number of production machine hours (instead of allocating those costs based on their root causes) will result in individual product costs that are inaccurate and misleading.",what
What is an independent variable?,"In accounting, an independent variable is ideally a factor that causes a change in the total amount of the dependent variable. In other words, an independent variable should be something that drives a mixed cost to increase or decrease.
To illustrate, let's assume that a manufacturer's production equipment uses a significant amount of electricity. Hence, the monthly electricity cost (the dependent variable) will increase when there is an increase in the number of production machine hours (the independent variable).
In reality there are likely to be many independent variables that cause a change in the amount of the dependent variable. In the case of the monthly electricity cost, the independent variables could also include the non-production machines using electricity, the physical size of the products, the skill level of the operators, the outside temperature and humidity, etc.
Multiple regression analysis is a statistical tool that can assist in determining the significant independent variables.",what
Why does a cost system developed for inventory valuation distort product cost information?,"The cost system for inventory valuation may have been developed to provide a reasonable total cost of inventory and a reasonable total cost of goods sold in order to have reasonably accurate financial statements. If a company has small inventory amounts and significant sales, a simple cost system that spreads manufacturing overhead costs solely on the basis of machine hours can result in a reasonably accurate balance sheet and income statement.
While a simple cost system using just one cost driver (machine hours) may result in accurate financial statements, it often fails to provide the true cost of individual products that vary in complexity. For example, one product might require very few machine hours but will require many hours of special handling. The costs assigned on the basis of machine hours alone will be too low in relationship to the true cost of manufacturing this product. Another product might require many machine hours but no other activities. This product's cost will be overstated because the rate assigned via the machine hours will include an amount for other activities that generally occur for the other products manufactured.
A cost system developed for inventory valuation is limited to the cost of direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead. The total cost of providing products to a customer will also include nonmanufacturing expenses. One customer might require a company to incur additional selling, delivering, storing, and administrative expenses. Another customer might not require any of those activities and their related expenses.
Activity based costing attempts to calculate the true cost of a product and customer by assigning costs and expenses based on their root causes. Because there are many root causes, the company will assign costs based on many cost drivers. This results in more accuracy for the cost and expense of a specific product for a specific customer than simply spreading the manufacturing costs on the basis of one cost driver such as machine hours.",what
Are there two ABC methods in accounting?,"Some accountants use ABC to mean Activity Based Costing. Under this ABC a manufacturer will use many cost drivers to assign overhead costs to products. The objective of Activity Based Costing is to assign the overhead costs based on their root causes rather than merely spreading the costs on the basis of direct labor hours or production machine hours.
A second use of ABC involves categorizing inventory items into ""A"" items, ""B"" items, and ""C"" items. The ""A"" items are a relatively small number of items which account for the majority of the inventory's value. For example, the ""A"" items might be 20% of the items in inventory which account for 70% of the inventory value. At the other extreme the ""C"" items might be 60% of the items in inventory but they account for only 10% of the inventory value. The ""B"" items might be 20% of the items accounting for 20% of the inventory value. Under this system, the ""A"" items will receive the most attention since they account for 70% of the value. This ABC is sometimes referred to as Pareto analysis or Pareto's rule and it can be applied to more than inventory. For example, 20% of a company's customers might account for 70% of the company's sales.",what
What is the accrual basis of accounting?,"Definition of Accrual Basis of Accounting
Under the accrual basis of accounting (or accrual method of accounting), revenues are reported on the income statement when they are earned. When the revenues are earned but cash is not received, the asset accounts receivable will be recorded. (Under the cash basis of accounting, revenues are not reported on the income statement until the cash is received.)
Also under the accrual basis of accounting, expenses are reported on the income statement when they match up with the revenues being reported, or when a cost has no future benefit that can be measured. When an expense occurs and cash has not yet been paid, a liability account will also be recorded. (The expenses that were not paid in the current accounting period will be reported through adjusting entries.)
In other words, under the accrual basis of accounting, the receipt of cash and the payment of cash are not the focus of reporting revenues and expenses. Rather the focus is: 1) what revenues were earned, and 2) what expenses were incurred. Therefore, the accrual basis of accounting provides a more accurate measure of a company's profitability during an accounting period, and a more accurate picture of a company's assets and liabilities at the end of an accounting period.
Example of Reporting Revenues Under the Accrual Basis of Accounting
Let's assume that I begin an accounting business in December and during December I provided $10,000 of accounting services. Since I allow clients to pay in 30 days, none of the $10,000 of fees that I earned in December were received in December. Rather, my clients paid the $10,000 in January. Under the accrual basis of accounting my business will report the $10,000 of revenues I earned on the December income statement and will report accounts receivable of $10,000 on the December 31 balance sheet.
Example of Reporting Expenses Under the Accrual Basis of Accounting
Now let's assume that I paid office rent of $1,500 and incurred $300 of costs for electricity, gas, and sewer/water during December. However, the utilities will not read the meters until January 1, will bill me on January 10 and require that I pay the bill by February 1. Under the accrual basis of accounting I will report the rent expense in December because the rent was used up in December, and I will also report estimated utilities expense of $300 so that the December income statement provides a better measure of December's profitability. Also the December 31 balance sheet will report a liability such as utilities payable of $300 to communicate a more accurate measure of obligations at December 31.
Comparing Accrual Basis to Cash Basis
Using the transactions above, the accrual basis of accounting will result in the December income statement reporting revenues of $10,000 and expenses of $1,800 for a net income of $8,200.
Using the cash basis of accounting the December income statement will report $0 revenues and expenses of $1,500 for a net loss of $8,500 even though I had earned $10,000 in accounting fees. Further, the balance sheet will not report the obligation for the utilities that were used. The January income statement will report the collection of the fees earned in December, and the February income statement will report the expense of using the December utilities. Hence, the cash basis of accounting can be misleading to the readers of the financial statements.
For financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the accrual basis of accounting is required because of the matching principle.",what
What are accruals?,"Definition of Accruals
The accounting and bookkeeping term accruals refers to adjustments that must be made before a company's financial statements are issued. Accruals involve the following types of business transactions:

expenses, losses, and liabilities that have been incurred but are not yet recorded in the accounts, and
revenues and assets that have been earned but are not yet recorded in the accounts

Example of an Accrual of an Expense
One example of an accrual of an expense and liability is a major repair that occurs in the final month of the accounting year, but is not paid until the bill is received in the first month of the following year. For the current year's financial statements to be complete (under the accrual method of accounting) the following is necessary:

the income statement for the current year must report the repair expense, and
the balance sheet as of the last day of the year must report the related liability

To record this accrual, an adjusting entry is made that debits Repairs Expense and credits Accrued Expenses Payable. 
Example of an Accrual of Revenues
One example of an accrual of revenues occurs at your electric utility company. For instance, during December the utility likely uses natural gas and/or coal plus many employees to generate the electricity used by its customers in December. However, the utility does not bill its customers for that electricity until after it reads the meters in January. As a result, the utility's financial statements will need an accrual adjustment so that:

its income statement for the month of December and for the current year will report all of the revenues earned by the utility, and
its December 31 balance sheet will report a current asset for the amount it has a right to receive from its customers (including the amount for the electricity it provided in December)

The accrual adjustment will debit the current asset account Accrued Receivables and will credit the income statement account Accrued Electricity Revenues.",what
What is the double declining balance method of depreciation?,"Definition of Double Declining Balance Method of Depreciation
The double declining balance method of depreciation, also known as the 200% declining balance method of depreciation, is a form of accelerated depreciation. This means that compared to the straight-line method, the depreciation expense will be faster in the early years of the asset's life but slower in the later years. However, the total amount of depreciation expense during the life of the assets will be the same. 
The ""double"" means 200% of the straight line rate of depreciation, while the ""declining balance"" refers to the asset's book value or carrying value at the beginning of the accounting period. Since book value is an asset's cost minus its accumulated depreciation, the asset's book value will be decreasing when the contra asset account Accumulated Depreciation is credited with the depreciation expense of the accounting period.
Example of Double Declining Balance Depreciation
Let's assume that a retailer purchases fixtures on January 1 at a cost of $100,000. It is expected that the fixtures will have no salvage value at the end of their useful life of 10 years. Under the straight-line method, the 10-year life means the asset's annual depreciation will be 10% of the asset's cost. Under the double declining balance method the 10% straight line rate is doubled to 20%. However, the 20% is multiplied times the fixture's book value at the beginning of the year instead of the fixture's original cost.
At the beginning of the first year, the fixture's book value is $100,000 since the fixtures have not yet had any depreciation. Therefore, under the double declining balance method the $100,000 of book value will be multiplied by 20% and will result in $20,000 of depreciation for Year 1. The journal entry will be a debit of $20,000 to Depreciation Expense and a credit of $20,000 to Accumulated Depreciation.
At the beginning of the second year, the fixture's book value will be $80,000, which is the cost of $100,000 minus the accumulated depreciation of $20,000. When the $80,000 is multiplied by 20% the result is $16,000 of depreciation for Year 2.
At the beginning of Year 3, the asset's book value will be $64,000. This is the fixture's cost of $100,000 minus its accumulated depreciation of $36,000 ($20,000 + $16,000). The book value of $64,000 multiplied by 20% is $12,800 of depreciation expense for Year 3.
At the beginning of Year 4, the asset's book value will be $51,200. Therefore, the book value of $51,200 multiplied by 20% will result in $10,240 of depreciation expense for Year 4.
At the beginning of Year 5, the asset's book value will be $40,960. This is the amount to be depreciated over the remaining 6 years. In year 5, companies often switch to straight-line depreciation and debit Depreciation Expense and credit Accumulated Depreciation for $6,827 ($40,960/6 years) in each of the six remaining years.",what
What is a trial balance?,"Definition of a Trial Balance
A trial balance is a bookkeeping or accounting report that lists the balances in each of an organization's general ledger accounts. (Often the accounts with zero balances will not be listed.) The debit balance amounts are listed in a column with the heading ""Debit balances"" and the credit balance amounts are listed in another column with the heading ""Credit balances."" The total of each of these two columns should be identical.
Examples of the Trial Balance's Use
The trial balance is not a financial statement. It is mainly an internal report that is/was useful in a manual accounting system. If the trial balance did not ""balance"" it signaled an error somewhere between the journal and the trial balance. Often the cause of the difference was a miscalculation of an account balance, posting a debit amount as a credit (or vice versa), transposing digits within an amount when posting or preparing the trial balance, etc.
Today's accounting software has been written to eliminate those errors. Hence, the trial balance is less important for bookkeeping purposes since it is almost certain that the general ledger and the trial balance will have the debits equal to the credits.
The trial balance continues to be useful for auditors and accountants who wish to show 1) the general ledger account balances prior to their proposed adjustments, 2) their proposed adjustments, and 3) all of the account balances after the proposed adjustments. The adjusted amounts make up the adjusted trial balance, and the adjusted amounts will be used in the organization's financial statements.",what
What is a journal entry?,"Definition of a Journal Entry
In manual accounting or bookkeeping systems, business transactions are first recorded in a journal...hence the term journal entry.
Journal entries that are recorded in a company's general journal will consist of the following:

the appropriate date
the account(s) and amount(s) that will be debited
the account(s) and amount(s) that will be credited
a short description/memo/reference

The journal entries appear in a journal in order by date and are then posted to the appropriate accounts in the general ledger.
Computerized accounting systems will automatically record most of the business transactions into the general ledger accounts immediately after the software prepares the sales invoices, issues checks to creditors, processes receipts from customers, etc. Hence, we will not write journal entries for most of the business transactions.
Examples of Journal Entries
Even with computerized accounting systems some general journal entries are necessary. Common general journal entries are the adjusting entries. For example, prior to issuing the company's financial statements there will be an adjusting entry to record depreciation. This journal entry will debit Depreciation Expense and will credit Accumulated Depreciation.
Another example of a general journal entry is the adjusting entry to accrue interest on a bank loan. This journal entry will debit Interest Expense and will credit Interest Payable.",what
What are accrued expenses and when are they recorded?,"Accrued Expenses
Accrued expenses are expenses that have occurred but are not yet recorded in the company's general ledger. This means these expenses will not appear on the financial statements unless an adjusting entry is entered prior to issuing the financial statements.
Example of an Accrued Expense
To illustrate an accrued expense, let's assume that a company borrowed $200,000 on December 1. The agreement requires that the company repay the $200,000 on February 28 along with $6,000 of interest for the three months of December through February. As of December 31, the company will not have an invoice to process and will not be paying the interest until it is due on February 28.
Recording an Accrued Expense
Without an adjusting entry to accrue the interest expense that was incurred by the company in December, the company's financial statements as of December 31 will not be reporting the $2,000 of interest (one-third of the $6,000) that the company has incurred in December. In order for the financial statements to be correct on the accrual basis of accounting, the accountant must record an adjusting entry dated as of December 31. The adjusting entry will consist of a debit of $2,000 to Interest Expense (an income statement account) and a credit of $2,000 to Interest Payable (a balance sheet account).

Income Statement: Retail/Whsle - Corporation, Multiple-Step",what
What is accounts receivable?,"Definition of Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable is the amount owed to a company resulting from the company providing goods and/or services on credit. The term trade receivable is also used in place of accounts receivable.
The amount that the company is owed is recorded in its general ledger account entitled Accounts Receivable. The unpaid balance in this account is reported as part of the current assets listed on the company's balance sheet. 
When goods are sold on credit, the seller is likely to be an unsecured creditor of its customer. Therefore, the seller should be cautious when selling goods on credit.
Good accounting requires that an estimate should be made for any amount in Accounts Receivable that is unlikely to be collected. The estimated amount is reported as a credit balance in a contra-receivable account such as Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. This credit balance will cause the amount of accounts receivable reported on the balance sheet to be reduced. Any adjustment to the Allowance account will also affect Uncollectible Accounts Expense, which is reported on the income statement.
Example of Accounts Receivable
A manufacturer will record an account receivable when it delivers a truckload of goods to a customer on June 1 and the customer is allowed to pay in 30 days. From June 1 until the company receives the money, the company will have an account receivable (and the customer will have an account payable).",what
What are prepaid expenses?,"Definition of Prepaid Expenses
Prepaid expenses are future expenses that have been paid in advance. In other words, prepaid expenses are costs that have been paid but are not yet used up or have not yet expired.
Generally, the amount of prepaid expenses that will be used up within one year are reported on a company's balance sheet as a current asset. As the amount expires, the current asset is reduced and the amount of the reduction is reported as an expense on the income statement.
Example of Prepaid Expenses
A common prepaid expense is the six-month insurance premium that is paid in advance for insurance coverage on a company's vehicles. The amount paid is often recorded in the current asset account Prepaid Insurance. If the company issues monthly financial statements, its income statement will report Insurance Expense which is one-sixth of the six-month premium. The balance in the account Prepaid Insurance will be the amount that is still prepaid as of the date of the balance sheet.",what
What is the difference between an accrual and a deferral?,"Definition of an Accrual
An accrual pertains to:

expenses that should be reported now, but have not yet been recorded or paid, and
revenues that should be reported now, but have not yet been recorded nor has the money been received

Example of an Expense Accrual
The accrual of an expense or an expense accrual refers to the reporting of an expense and the related liability in an accounting period that is prior to the period when the amount will be paid or the vendor's invoice will be processed. An example of an expense accrual is the electricity that is used in December where neither the bill nor the payment will be processed until January. The December electricity should be recorded as of December 31 with an accrual adjusting entry that debits Electricity Expense and credits a liability account such as Accrued Expenses Payable.
Example of a Revenue Accrual
The accrual of revenues or a revenue accrual refers to the reporting of revenue and the related asset in the period in which they are earned, and which is prior to processing a sales invoice or receiving the money. An example of the accrual of revenues is a bond investment's interest that is earned in December but the money will not be received until a later accounting period. This interest should be recorded as of December 31 with an accrual adjusting entry that debits Interest Receivable and credits Interest Income.
Definition of a Deferral
A deferral occurs when a company has:

paid out money that should be reported as an expense in a later accounting period, and/or
received money that should be reported as revenue in a later accounting period

Example of an Expense Deferral
A deferral of an expense or an expense deferral involves a payment that was paid in advance of the accounting period(s) in which it will become an expense. An example is a payment made in December for property insurance covering the next six months of January through June. The amount that is not yet expired should be reported as a current asset such as Prepaid Insurance or Prepaid Expenses. The amount that expires in an accounting period should be reported as Insurance Expense.
Example of a Revenue Deferral
A deferral of revenues or a revenue deferral involves money that was received in advance of earning it. An example is the insurance company receiving money in December for providing insurance protection for the next six months. Until the money is earned, the insurance company should report the unearned amount as a current liability such as Unearned Insurance Premiums. As the insurance premiums are earned, they should be reported on the income statement as Insurance Premium Revenues.",what
What is meant by reconciling an account?,"Definition of Reconciling an Account
Reconciling an account is likely to mean proving or documenting that an account balance is correct.
Examples of Reconciling an Account
When a company reconciles its bank statement, it is reconciling the balance in its general ledger account Cash (or Cash: Checking Account) with the bank's information.
Prior to issuing a company's financial statements, it is wise to reconcile every balance sheet account by collecting the information that supports the accounts' ending balances. For example, the Accounts Receivable balance could begin by comparing the balance with an aging of the accounts receivable. 
Another example is reconciling the balance in the general ledger account Utilities Payable. This might be accomplished by computing the daily cost of each utility that the company uses. The cost per day is then multiplied by the number of days since the last meter reading date shown on the utility bills that have already been recorded.",what
What is the provision for bad debts?,"Definition of Provision for Bad Debts
The provision for bad debts could refer to the balance sheet account also known as the Allowance for Bad Debts, Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, or Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts. If so, the account Provision for Bad Debts is a contra asset account (an asset account with a credit balance). It is used along with the account Accounts Receivable in order for the balance sheet to report the net realizable value of the company's accounts receivable. The entry to increase the credit balance in these contra accounts is a debit to the income statement account Bad Debts Expense.
Some companies might use the description provision for bad debts on its income statement in order to report the credit losses that pertain to the period of the income statement. In that case, provision for bad debts would be an income statement account. However, the U.S. accounting textbooks are more likely to use Bad Debts Expense or Uncollectible Accounts Expense to describe the amount reported on the income statement.",what
What is the difference between stocks and bonds?,"Definition of Stocks
Stocks, or shares of capital stock, represent an ownership interest in a corporation. Every corporation has common stock. Some corporations issue preferred stock in addition to its common stock. Shares of common stock do not have maturity dates.
Stocks pay dividends, which are a distribution of the corporation's profits to its owners. However, the dividend occurs only if the corporation's board of directors declare the dividend. The dividend payments are not an expense on the corporation's financial statements or on its U.S. income tax return.
Definition of Bonds
Bonds are a form of long-term debt in which the issuing corporation promises to pay the principal amount at a specified maturity date. 
Bonds also promise to pay a fixed interest payment to the bondholders usually every six months until the bonds mature. In the U.S. the interest paid to the bondholders by the corporation is a deductible expense on the corporation's income tax return.
Typically businesses do not issue bonds.",what
Why is depreciation on the income statement different from the depreciation on the balance sheet?,"Definition of Depreciation
Depreciation is the systematic allocation of an asset's cost to expense over the useful life of the asset.
Example of Depreciation
Let's assume that a retailer purchased displays for its store at a cost of $120,000. The displays have a useful life of 10 years and will have no salvage value. The straight-line method of depreciation will result in depreciation of $1,000 per month ($120,000 divided by 120 months). The monthly journal entry to record the depreciation will be a debit of $1,000 to the income statement account Depreciation Expense and a credit of $1,000 to the balance sheet contra asset account Accumulated Depreciation.
Depreciation on the Income Statement
The depreciation reported on the income statement is the amount of depreciation expense that is appropriate for the period of time indicated in the heading of the income statement. 
Using our example, the monthly income statements will report $1,000 of depreciation expense. The quarterly income statements will report $3,000 of depreciation expense, and the annual income statements will report $12,000 of depreciation expense. Each month $1,000 of depreciation expense is being matched to the 120 monthly income statements during which the displays are used to generate sales revenues.
Depreciation on the Balance Sheet
The depreciation reported on the balance sheet is the accumulated or the cumulative total amount of depreciation that has been reported as depreciation expense on the income statement from the time the assets were acquired until the date of the balance sheet.
Using our example, after one month of use the accumulated depreciation for the displays will be $1,000. After 24 months of use, the accumulated depreciation reported on the balance sheet will be $24,000. After 120 months, the accumulated depreciation reported on the balance sheet will be $120,000. At that point, the depreciation will stop since the displays' cost of $120,000 has been fully depreciated. If the displays continue to be used in the 11th year, there will be no depreciation expense in the 11th year and the accumulated depreciation will continue to be $120,000.",what
How do I calculate depreciation using the sum of the years' digits?,"Definition of Sum of the Years' Digits Depreciation
The sum of the years' digits depreciation (SYD depreciation) is one method for calculating accelerated depreciation. (A more common method of accelerated depreciation is the declining balance method used in tax depreciation.) Compared to the straight line depreciation method, the sum of the years' digits method will result in greater depreciation in the earlier years of an asset's useful life and less in the later years. However, the total amount of depreciation over an asset's useful life should be the same regardless of which depreciation method is used. The difference is in the timing of when the depreciation will be reported.
Example of Sum of the Years' Digits Depreciation
To illustrate the SYD method of depreciation, let's assume that equipment is purchased at a cost of $160,000. This asset is expected to have a useful life of 5 years and then be sold for $10,000. This means that the total amount of depreciation will be $150,000 spread over its useful life of 5 years.
The next step is to sum (add) up the digits in the five years of the asset's useful life: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15. The ""15"" will be the denominator for the fractions 5/15, 4/15, 3/15, etc. In the first year of the asset's life, 5/15 of the $150,000 or $50,000 will be debited to Depreciation Expense and $50,000 will be credited to Accumulated Depreciation.
In the second year of the asset's life, the depreciation amount will be $40,000 (4/15 of $150,000). The third year the depreciation will be $30,000 (3/15 of $150,000). The fourth year depreciation will be $20,000 (2/15 of $150,000). In the fifth year of the asset's life, the depreciation will be $10,000 (1/15 of $150,000). Remember that in this example, the total amount of depreciation during the asset's useful life needs to add up to $150,000.
Instead of adding the individual digits in the years of the asset's useful life, the following formula can be used to compute the sum of the digits: n(n+1) divided by 2, where n = the useful life in years. Using this formula for our example, we have: 5(5+1)/2 = 5(6)/2 = 30/2 = 15. [If the formula is used for an asset having a useful life of 10 years, the digits will sum to the following: 10(10+1)/2 = 10(11)/2 = 110/2 = 55. In the first year of this asset's useful life, the depreciation will be 10/55 of the amount to be depreciated. The second year will use 9/55 and the tenth year will use 1/55.]",what
Where does revenue received in advance go on a balance sheet?,"Definition of Revenue Received in Advance
Under the accrual basis of accounting, revenues received in advance of being earned are reported as a liability. If they will be earned within one year, they should be listed as a current liability.
When a company receives money in advance of earning it, the accounting entry is a debit to the asset Cash for the amount received and a credit to the liability account such as Customer Advances or Unearned Revenues.
As the amount received in advance is earned, the liability account should be debited for the amount earned and a revenue account should be credited. This is done through an adjusting entry.
Examples of Revenue Received in Advance
The following are a few examples of revenue received in advance:

An insurance company receiving premiums for protection during the following six months
A magazine publisher receiving money from a subscriber for magazines for the following year
A website design company receiving a client's down payment for future work
A law firm receiving a retainer fee from a new client",what
How do you calculate accrued vacation pay?,"Definition of Accrued Vacation Pay
Accrued vacation pay is the amount of vacation pay that a company's employees have earned, but the company has not yet paid.
Example of Accrued Vacation Pay
Let's assume that a company has a formal agreement that provides its employees with 120 hours of paid vacation in the year following the employees' full-time employment. Let's also assume that the company has only one full-time employee who began working at the company on January 1 of the current year and has an hourly pay rate of $26. In the current year, this employee will earn vacation pay of $3,120 (120 hours x $26), or $60 per week ($3,120 per year divided by 52 weeks). This means that in the current year the company must record vacation pay expense and a related liability at a rate of $60 per week.
In our example, the company has only the one full-time employee, so the company's December 31 balance sheet must report a current liability of $3,120.
Vacation pay is an example of an accrued expense and an accrued liability that is required by the matching principle.
Balance Sheet: Retail/Wholesale - Corporation",what
What is deferred revenue?,"Deferred Revenue
Deferred revenue is money received by a company in advance of having earned it. In other words, deferred revenues are not yet revenues and therefore cannot yet be reported on the income statement. As a result, the unearned amount must be deferred to the company's balance sheet where it will be reported as a liability.
The title of the general ledger liability account may have the title of Unearned Revenues, Deferred Revenues, or Customer Deposits. As the deferred amount is earned, it should be moved from Unearned Revenues to an income statement revenue account (such as Sales Revenues, Service Revenues, Fees Earned, etc).
Example of Deferred Revenue
To illustrate deferred revenue, let's assume that a company designs websites and has been asked to provide a price quote for a new website. The design company states that it can complete the new website for $70,000. The terms require a payment of $30,000 at the time the contract is signed and $40,000 at the end of the project, which is estimated to take 60 days. The company agrees to begin working on the project 10 days after the $30,000 is received.
Now let's assume that on December 27, the design company receives the $30,000 and it will begin the project on January 4. Therefore, on December 27, the design company will record a debit of $30,000 to Cash and a credit of $30,000 to Deferred Revenues. On December 31, its balance sheet will report a current liability of $30,000 with the description Deferred revenues.
As of January 31 the company has completed 2/7 of the work. Therefore, it will record an adjusting entry dated January 31 that will debit Deferred Revenues for $20,000 and will credit the income statement account Design Revenues for $20,000. Thus, the January 31 balance sheet will report Deferred revenues of $10,000 (the company's remaining obligation/liability from the $30,000 it received on December 27).",what
What is depreciation?,"Definition of Depreciation
In accounting, depreciation is the assigning or allocating of the cost of a plant asset (other than land) to expense in the accounting periods that are within the asset's useful life. 
Example of Depreciation
Let's assume that a business purchases a delivery truck with a cost of $100,000 and it is expected to be used for 5 years. If we also assume that the truck will have no salvage value, the company will record depreciation expense of $100,000 over the five years. When the straight-line method of depreciation is used the annual depreciation expense will be $20,000. (The amounts can vary depending on the depreciation method and assumptions.)",what
What are adjusting entries?,"Definition of Adjusting Entries
Adjusting entries are usually made on the last day of an accounting period (year, quarter, month) so that a company's financial statements comply with the accrual method of accounting. In other words, the adjusting entries are needed so that a company's:

Income statement reports the revenues that have been earned during the accounting period
Balance sheet reports the receivables that it has a right to receive as of the end of the accounting period
Income statement reports the expenses  and losses that were incurred during the accounting period
Balance sheet reports the liabilities it has incurred as of the end of the accounting period

Examples of Adjusting Entries
Here are a few examples of the need for adjusting entries:

A company shipped goods on credit, but the company's sales invoice was not processed as of the end of the accounting period
A company received some goods from a vendor but the vendor's invoice had not been processed by the company as of the end of the accounting period
A company that prepares monthly income statements paid for 6 months of insurance coverage in the first month of the insurance coverage. (This means that 5/6 of the payment is a prepaid asset and only 1/6 of the payment should be reported as an expense on each of the monthly income statements.)
A company's customer paid in advance for services to be provided over several accounting periods. Until the services are provided, the unearned amount is reported as a liability. After the services are provided, an entry is needed to reduce the liability and to report the revenues.

Note that a common characteristic of every adjusting entry will involve at least one income statement account and at least one balance sheet account.",what
What are reversing entries and why are they used?,"Definition of Reversing Entries
Reversing entries are made on the first day of an accounting period to remove accrual adjusting entries that were made at the end of the previous accounting period. Two benefits of using reversing entries are:

It greatly reduces the chance of double-counting revenues and/or expenses, and
It allows for more efficient processing of the actual invoices that will be processed in the new
accounting period

Example of Reversing Entries
To illustrate reversing entries, let's assume that a retailer uses a temporary employment agency service to provide workers from December 15 to December 29. The temp agency will bill the retailer on January 6 and the retailer is required to pay the invoice by January 10. Assuming the retailer's accounting year ends on December 31, the retailer will make an accrual adjusting entry on December 31 for the estimated amount. If the estimated amount is $18,000 the retailer will debit Temp Service Expense for $18,000 and will credit Accrued Expenses Payable for $18,000. This adjusting entry assures that the retailer's income statement for the period ended December 31 will report the $18,000 expense and its balance sheet as of December 31 will report the $18,000 liability.
After the financial statements are prepared, the closing entries will transfer the balance in the account Temp Service Expense to an owner's/stockholders' equity account. As a result, the account Temp Service Expense will begin January with a zero balance. 
When a reversing entry is recorded as of January 1, it simply removes the estimated amounts contained in the December 31 accrual adjusting entry. In other words, the January 1 reversing entry will:

Debit Accrued Expenses Payable for $18,000, and
Credit Temp Service Expense for $18,000

After the January 1 reversing entry, the account Accrued Expenses Payable will have a zero balance, and the account Temp Service Expense will have an unusual credit balance of $18,000.
When the temp agency's invoice dated January 6 arrives, the retailer can simply debit the invoice amount to Temp Service Expense and credit Accounts Payable (the normal routine procedure). If the actual invoice is $18,000 the balance in Temp Service Expense will change from a credit balance of $18,000 to a balance of $0. (Zero is the correct expense for the new accounting period, since the $18,000 had been reported as an expense in the previous accounting period.) Thanks to the reversing entry, the person paying the retailer's bills can do what is done for any other vendor invoice.
If the invoice amount on January 6 had been $18,250 the entire amount would be debited to Temp Service Expense and credited to Accounts Payable. The resulting debit balance of $250 in Temp Service Expense will be reported as a January expense. Since the $250 is insignificant difference from an estimated amount, it is acceptable to report the $250 as a January expense instead of a December expense.",what
How do you record a payment for insurance?,"Definition of Payment for Insurance
A company's property insurance, liability insurance, business interruption insurance, etc. often covers a one-year period with the cost (insurance premiums) paid in advance. The one-year period for the insurance rarely coincides with the company's accounting year. Therefore, the insurance payments will likely involve more than one annual financial statement and many interim financial statements. 
Prepaid Insurance vs. Insurance Expense
When the insurance premiums are paid in advance, they are referred to as prepaid. At the end of any accounting period, the amount of the insurance premiums that remain prepaid should be reported in the current asset account, Prepaid Insurance. The prepaid amount will be reported on the balance sheet after inventory and could part of an item described as prepaid expenses.
As the prepaid amount expires, the balance in Prepaid Insurance is reduced by a credit to Prepaid Insurance and a debit to Insurance Expense. This is done with an adjusting entry at the end of each accounting period (e.g. monthly). One objective of the adjusting entry is to match the proper amount of insurance expense to the period indicated on the income statement.
Example of Payment for Insurance Expense
Let's assume that a company is started on December 1 and arranges for business insurance to begin on December 1. On December 1 the company pays the insurance company $12,000 for the insurance premiums covering one year. The company will record the payment with a debit of $12,000 to Prepaid Insurance and a credit of $12,000 to Cash.
On December 31, the company writes an adjusting entry to record the insurance expense that was used up (expired) and to reduce the amount that remains prepaid. This is accomplished with a debit of $1,000 to Insurance Expense and a credit of $1,000 to Prepaid Insurance. This same adjusting entry will be prepared at the end of each of the next 11 months.",what
What is the accounting cycle?,"Definition of Accounting Cycle
The accounting cycle is often described as a process that includes the following steps:

Identifying, collecting and analyzing documents and transactions
Recording the transactions in journals
Posting the journalized amounts to accounts in the general and subsidiary ledgers
Preparing an unadjusted trial balance and perhaps preparing a worksheet
Determining and recording adjusting entries
Preparing an adjusted trial balance
Preparing the financial statements
Recording and posting closing entries
Preparing a post-closing trial balance
Recording reversing entries

Accounting Cycle Today
The above steps were clear in a manual accounting system. However, today these steps are occurring with electronic speed and accuracy within sophisticated yet inexpensive accounting software. The accountant can enter adjusting entries into the software and can instantaneously obtain a complete set of financial statements by simply selecting them from a menu. After reviewing the financial statements, the accountant is able to make additional adjustments and almost immediately obtain the revised reports. The software will also prepare, record, and post the closing entries. It will also reverse adjusting entries that have been designated to be reversed.",what
What is bad debts expense?,"Definition of Bad Debts Expense
Bad debts expense is related to a company's current asset accounts receivable. Bad debts expense is also referred to as uncollectible accounts expense or doubtful accounts expense. Bad debts expense results because a company delivered goods or services on credit and the customer did not pay the amount owed.
Examples of Bad Debts Expense
There are two methods for reporting the amount of bad debts expense:

direct write-off method
allowance method

The direct write-off method requires that a customer's uncollectible account be removed from Accounts Receivable and at that time the following entry is made: debit Bad Debts Expense and credit Accounts Receivable.
The allowance method  anticipates and estimates that some of the accounts receivable will not be collected. In other words, prior to knowing exactly which customers or clients will not be paying, the company will debit Bad Debts Expense and will credit Allowance for Doubtful Accounts for the estimated amount. (The Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is a contra asset account that when presented along with Accounts Receivable indicates a more realistic amount that will be turning to cash.)
For financial statement purposes the allowance method is the better method since 1) the balance sheet will be reporting a more realistic amount that will be collected from the company's accounts receivable, and 2) the bad debts expense will be reported on the income statement closer to the time of the related credit sales. However, for income tax purposes the direct write-off method must be used.",what
What are balance sheet accounts?,"Definition of Balance Sheet Accounts
Balance sheet accounts are one of two types of general ledger accounts. (The other accounts in the general ledger are the income statement accounts.) 
Balance sheet accounts are used to sort and store transactions involving a company's assets, liabilities, and owner's or stockholders' equity. The balances in these accounts as of the final moment of an accounting year will be reported on the company's end-of-year balance sheet.
Balance sheet accounts are also referred to as permanent or real accounts because at the end of the accounting year the balances in these accounts are not closed. Instead, the ending balances will be carried forward to become the beginning balances in the next accounting year. (This is different from the income statement accounts which are closed at the end of each accounting year and will begin the following year with zero balances.)
Examples of Balance Sheet Accounts
Examples of a corporation's balance sheet accounts include Cash, Temporary Investments, Accounts Receivable, Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, Inventory, Investments, Land, Buildings, Equipment, Furniture and Fixtures, Accumulated Depreciation, Notes Payable, Accounts Payable, Payroll Taxes Payable, Paid-in Capital, Retained Earnings, and others.",what
What is bad debts?,"Definition of Bad Debts
The term bad debts usually refers to accounts receivable (or trade accounts receivable) that will not be collected. (Bad debts is also used for notes receivable that will not be collected.)
The bad debts associated with accounts receivable is reported on the income statement as Bad Debts Expense or Uncollectible Accounts Expense.
Examples of Recording Bad Debts
There are two methods for recording the bad debts associated with accounts receivable:

Direct write-off method, which removes the uncollectible amount directly from Accounts Receivable and records the amount as Bad Debts Expense
Allowance method, which estimates the likely amount that will not be collected, and immediately credits Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and debits Bad Debts Expense.",what
Why and how do you adjust the inventory account in the periodic method?,"Definition of Inventory Account in Periodic Method
Under the periodic method or periodic system, the account Inventory is dormant throughout the accounting year and will report only the cost of the prior year's ending inventory. The current year's purchases are recorded in one or more temporary accounts entitled Purchases. At the end of the accounting year, the beginning balance in the account Inventory must be changed so that it reports the cost (or perhaps lower than the cost) of the ending inventory.
Examples of Adjusting the Inventory Account
When using the periodic method, balance in the inventory account can be changed to the ending inventory's cost by recording an adjusting entry.
To illustrate, let's assume that the cost of a company's beginning inventory (last year's ending inventory) was $35,000. This balance will be the only amount in the account Inventory until the end of the year. Let's assume that at the end of the year a physical count of inventory is taken and it has an actual cost of $40,000. To adjust the Inventory account balance from a debit balance of $35,000 to a debit balance of $40,000, the following adjusting entry will be needed:

Debit Inventory for $5,000, and
Credit Inventory Change for $5,000

Let's also assume that the Purchases account showed a debit balance of $200,000 for the year.
The account Inventory Change is an income statement account that when combined with the amount in the Purchases account will result in the cost of goods sold. In our example, the $5,000 credit balance in the account Inventory Change will reduce the $200,000 of Purchases, resulting in the cost of goods sold of $195,000 ($200,000 of purchases minus the $5,000 of purchases that were not sold and caused inventory to increase). 
As an additional example, let's assume that in the following year the company's ending inventory has a cost of $29,000. However, the inventory account has the debit balance of $40,000 from the prior year. This situation will require the following adjusting entry:

Credit Inventory for $11,000, and
Debit Inventory Change for $11,000

Let's also assume that the Purchases account showed a debit balance of $230,000 for the year.
The debit balance of $11,000 in the account Inventory Change when combined with the debit balance of $230,000 in the Purchases account will result in the cost of the goods sold of $241,000 ($230,000 of purchases plus $11,000 that was sold from inventory). 
Textbooks may change the balance in the account Inventory (under the periodic method) through the closing entries. (One closing entry removes the amount of beginning inventory and one closing entry records the cost of the ending inventory.) We believe that an adjusting entry is more logical and efficient, especially when a company's monthly and year-to-date financial statements are prepared using accounting software.",what
What is prepaid insurance?,"Definition of Prepaid Insurance
Prepaid insurance is the portion of an insurance premium that has been paid in advance and has not expired as of the date of a company's balance sheet. This unexpired cost is reported in the current asset account Prepaid Insurance.
As the amount of prepaid insurance expires, the expired portion is moved from the current asset account Prepaid Insurance to the income statement account Insurance Expense. This is usually done at the end of each accounting period through an adjusting entry.
Example of Prepaid Insurance
To illustrate prepaid insurance, let's assume that on November 20 a company pays an insurance premium of $2,400 for insurance protection during the six-month period of December 1 through May 31. On November 20, the payment is entered with a debit of $2,400 to Prepaid Insurance and a credit of $2,400 to Cash.
As of November 30 none of the $2,400 cost has expired and the entire $2,400 will be reported on the balance sheet as Prepaid Insurance or Prepaid Expenses. On December 31, an adjusting entry will debit Insurance Expense for $400 (the amount that expired: 1/6 of $2,400) and will credit Prepaid Insurance for $400. This means that the debit balance in Prepaid Insurance at December 31 will be $2,000 (5/6 of the $2,400 cost), since this is the amount that has not yet expired.
At the end of each month, an adjusting entry of $400 will be recorded to debit Insurance Expense and credit Prepaid Insurance.",what
What is the monthly close?,"Definition of Monthly Close
In accounting, monthly close is a series of steps and procedures that are followed so that a company's monthly financial statements are in compliance with the accrual method of accounting.
Since a company's business activities are ongoing, accountants might state ""we need to get a proper ""cut-off"" between the end-of-the-month transactions and those that belong in the following month.
If a company sells goods and has inventories, its monthly close will be more challenging. The company must be certain that the costs of the goods purchased are recorded in the same month as the goods are added to the inventories.
Reviewing the financial statements before they are distributed is also an important step in the monthly close. This could mean comparing the amounts and percentages on the current financial statements to those of earlier months. For example, if the current income statement shows the cost of goods sold as 86% instead of the normal 81%, the current month's amounts should be investigated before releasing the financial statements.",what
What is the difference between accounts payable and accrued expenses payable?,"Definition of Accounts Payable
Accounts Payable is a liability account in which suppliers' or vendors' approved invoices are recorded. As a result, the balance in Accounts Payable should be a precise amount.
Definition of Accrued Expenses Payable
Accrued Expenses Payable is a liability account that records amounts that are owed, but the vendors' invoices have not yet been received and/or have not yet been recorded in Accounts Payable as of the end of the accounting period. The amounts in this account are usually recorded with accrual adjusting entries made at the end of the accounting period.
Examples of Accrued Expenses Payable
In addition to the amounts associated with vendors' invoices, accrued expenses may also include wages, interest, utilities, and other expenses that were incurred and owed, but not yet recorded in the general ledger accounts. Some of the amounts recorded in Accrued Expenses Payable may be estimated amounts that should supported by reasonable and documented calculations.

How do I compute the units of production method of depreciation?,"Definition of Units of Production Depreciation
The units of production method of depreciation (which is also referred to as the units of activity method) assumes that an asset's useful life is more related to its usage rather than the mere passage of time. Under the units of production method, depreciation during a given year will be greater when there is a higher volume of activity. In times of low usage the asset's depreciation will be less.
Example of Calculating Units of Production Depreciation
To illustrate the units of production method, let's assume that a company has a machine with a cost of $500,000 and a useful life that is expected to end after producing 240,000 units of a component part. Further, the machine's salvage value at that point is assumed to be $20,000.
Given the above assumptions, the amount to be depreciated is $480,000 ($500,000 minus $20,000). Dividing the $480,000 by the machine's useful life of 240,000 units, the depreciation will be $2 per unit. If the machine produces 10,000 units in the first year, the depreciation for the year will be $20,000 ($2 x 10,000 units). If the machine produces 50,000 units in the next year, the depreciation will be $100,000 ($2 x 50,000 units). The depreciation will be calculated similarly each year until the asset's Accumulated Depreciation reaches $480,000.
The units of production method or units of activity method could be useful for depreciating airplanes and vehicles (based on miles used), printing machines (based on pages run), DVDs (based on number of times rented), etc.",what
What is the difference between cost and expense?,"Definition of Cost
A cost might be an expense or it might be an asset. 
Definition of Expense
An expense is a cost that has expired or was necessary in order to earn revenues. The matching principle guides accountants as to when a cost will be reported as an expense. 
Example of a Cost
A company's property insurance bill for the next six months of insurance shows a cost of $6,000. Initially the cost of $6,000 is reported as the current asset Prepaid Insurance (or Prepaid Expense) since the cost has not been used up (has not expired).
Example of an Expense
As a prepaid cost such as the $6,000 in the asset account Prepaid Insurance expires, the part that expires will be reported on the income statement as Insurance Expense. If the insurance cost is expiring at a rate of $1,000 per month, then each month the amount in the asset account Prepaid Insurance will decrease by $1,000 and Insurance Expense of $1,000 will be reported on the income statement.",what
What to do with the balance in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts?,"Definition of Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
The Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is a contra asset account that is used with the balance in Accounts Receivable to report the net realizable value of the receivables. 
Example of Adjusting the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
The balance in the account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts should be the estimated amount of the company's receivables that will not be turning to cash. For example, if the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts presently has a credit balance of $2,000 and you believe there is a total of $2,900 in Accounts Receivable that will not be collected, you need to enter an additional credit amount of $900 into the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. The other part of this adjusting entry will be a debit of $900 to Bad Debts Expense.
Note that some authors and companies may refer to the allowance account as Allowance for Uncollectible Expense, Allowance for Bad Debts or Provision for Bad Debts. The related income statement account could have the title of Uncollectible Accounts Expense, Doubtful Accounts Expense, etc.",what
What is a deferred expense?,"Definition of Deferred Expense
A deferred expense refers to a cost that has occurred but it will be reported as an expense in one or more future accounting periods. To accomplish this, the deferred expense is reported on the balance sheet as an asset or a contra liability until it is moved from the balance sheet to the income statement as an expense. This is done to achieve the accountants' matching principle. 
Examples of Deferred Expenses
Let's assume that a large corporation spends $500,000 in accounting, legal, and other fees in order to issue $40,000,000 of bonds payable. Instead of charging the $500,000 to expense in the year that the fees are paid, the corporation will defer the $500,000 to the contra liability account Bond Issue Costs. Then over the bonds' life of 25 years, the $500,000 will be amortized (systematically moved) to expense at the rate of $20,000 per year ($500,000 divided by 25 years).
Another example of a deferred expense is a $12,000 insurance premium paid by a company on December 27 for insurance protection during the upcoming January 1 through June 30. On December 27, the $12,000 is deferred to the balance sheet account Prepaid Insurance, which is a current asset account. Beginning in January it will be moved to Insurance Expense at the rate of $2,000 per month. The deferral was necessary to match the $12,000 to the proper year and months that the insurance is expiring and the company in receiving the insurance protection.",what
Where are accruals reflected on the balance sheet?,"Definition of Accruals
The accrual of expenses and liabilities refers to expenses and/or liabilities that a company has incurred, but the company has not yet paid or recorded the transaction. The accrual of an expense will usually involve an accrual adjusting entry that increases a company's expenses and increases its current liabilities.
The accrual of revenues and assets refers to revenues and/or assets that a company has earned, but the company has not yet received the money nor has it recorded the transaction. The accrual of revenues will usually involve an accrual adjusting entry that increases a company's revenues and increases its current assets.
Example of an Accrual as a Current Liability
Assume that a company has an emergency sewer repair on December 30. The plumbing contractor said the bill will be finalized and mailed to the company on January 10; however, the bill will be approximately $6,000. The company will need to accrue the expense incurred and the related current liability before the December 31 financial statements are prepared. The adjusting entry will debit Repairs Expense for $6,000, and credit Accrued Expenses Payable for $6,000.
Examples of other expenses that usually need an accrual adjusting entry resulting in a current liability include wages, utilities, bonuses, taxes, and interest.
Example of an Accrual as a Current Asset
Assume that during December a company has earned interest of $5,000 on its investment in U.S. Treasury bills. However, the interest will be received by the company on February 15. The company needs to accrue the revenue it earned and the related current asset before the December 31 financial statements are prepared. The adjusting entry will debit Interest Receivable for $5,000, and credit Investment Income for $5,000.

What are income statement accounts?,"Definition of Income Statement Accounts
Income statement accounts are one of two types of general ledger accounts. (The other accounts in the general ledger are the balance sheet accounts.)
Income statement accounts are used to sort and store transactions involving:

Operating revenues
Operating expenses
Non-operating revenues and gains
Non-operating expenses and losses

Large companies may have thousands of income statement accounts in order to budget and report revenues and expenses by divisions, product lines, departments, and so on. 
Income statement accounts are also referred to as temporary accounts or nominal accounts because at the end of each accounting year their balances will be closed. This means that the balances in the income statement accounts will be combined and the net amount transferred to a balance sheet equity account. In the case of a corporation, the equity account is Retained Earnings. In the case of a sole proprietorship, the equity account is the owner's capital account. As a result, the income statement accounts will begin the next accounting year with zero balances.
Examples of Income Statement Accounts
A few of the many income statement accounts used in a business include Sales, Sales Returns and Allowances, Service Revenues, Cost of Goods Sold, Salaries Expense, Wages Expense, Fringe Benefits Expense, Rent Expense, Utilities Expense, Advertising Expense, Automobile Expense, Depreciation Expense, Interest Expense, Gain on Disposal of Truck, and many more.",what
What is the proper accounting for supplies?,"Definition of Supplies
Office supplies are items used to carry out tasks in a company's departments outside of manufacturing or shipping. Office supplies are likely to include paper, printer cartridges, pens, etc. 
Shipping supplies are the cartons, tape, shrink wrap, etc. for preparing products that are being shipped to customers.
Manufacturing supplies are items used in the manufacturing facilities, but are not a direct material for the products manufactured. These will include a wide variety of items from cleaning supplies to machine lubricants.
Accounting for Office Supplies
The cost of office supplies on hand at the end of an accounting period should be the balance in a current asset account such as Supplies or Supplies on Hand. The cost of the office supplies used up during the accounting period should be recorded in the income statement account Supplies Expense. When supplies are purchased, the amount will be debited to Supplies. At the end of the accounting period, the balance in the account Supplies will be adjusted to be the amount on hand, and the amount of the adjustment will be recorded in Supplies Expense. (If the amount of supplies on hand is insignificant, a company may simply debit Supplies Expense when the supplies are purchased.) 
Accounting for Shipping Supplies
The cost of shipping supplies on hand will be reported as a current asset on the balance sheet and the shipping supplies used during the accounting period will be reported on the income statement as Shipping Supplies Expense.
Accounting for Manufacturing Supplies
The cost of manufacturing supplies on hand at the end of an accounting period will be reported in a balance sheet current asset account such as Inventory of Manufacturing Supplies. (There are likely to be several accounts or sub-accounts in order keep track of the manufacturing supplies by category.) When the manufacturing supplies are used they will become part of the manufacturing overhead, which is then allocated to the products manufactured.",what
What is interest expense?,"Definition of Interest Expense
Interest expense is the cost of borrowing money during a specified period of time. Interest expense is occurring daily, but the interest is likely to be paid monthly, quarterly, semiannually, or annually.
Example of Interest Expense
Let's assume that a company uses the accrual basis of accounting. If the company borrows $100,000 on December 15 and agrees to pay interest on the 15th day of each month at the rate of 1% per month, the interest expense for the month of December will be approximately $500 ($100,000 x 1% x 1/2 month). The interest expense for the month of January will be $1,000 ($100,000 x 1%).
In this example, as of December 31 no interest has been paid on the loan that began on December 15. However, the company did incur one-half month of interest expense. Therefore, the company needs to record an accrual adjusting entry that debits Interest Expense for $500, and credits Interest Payable for $500.",what
Is the provision for doubtful debts an operating expense?,"Definition of Provision for Doubtful Debts
Some companies use Provision for Doubtful Debts as the name of the contra-asset account which is reported on the company's balance sheet. Other companies use Provision for Doubtful Debts as the name for the current period's expense that is reported on the company's income statement.
If Provision for Doubtful Debts is the name of the account used for recording the current period's expense associated with the losses from normal credit sales, it will appear as an operating expense on the company's income statement. It may be included in the company's selling, general and administrative expenses.
[However, if the expense is associated with extending credit outside of a company's main selling activities, the credit loss will be reported as a nonoperating expense.]
Example of Provision for Doubtful Debts
Accounting textbooks avoid the use of the word ""provision"" and instead use the following terminology:

The contra-asset account associated with accounts receivable will have the account title Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.
The current period expense pertaining to accounts receivable (and its contra account) is recorded in the account Bad Debts Expense which is reported on the income statement as part of the operating expenses.",what
What is accrued interest?,"Definition of Accrued Interest
Accrued interest is the amount of loan interest that has already occurred, but has not yet been paid by the borrower and not yet received by the lender.
Under the accrual basis of accounting, the amount of accrued interest is to be recorded with accrual adjusting entries by the borrower and the lender before issuing their financial statements.
The borrower's adjusting entry will debit Interest Expense and credit Accrued Interest Payable (a current liability). The lender's adjusting entry will debit Accrued Interest Receivable (a current asset) and credit Interest Revenue (or Income).
Example of Accrued Interest
Let's assume that on December 16, a company borrows $20,000 from its bank at an annual interest rate of 6%. The first interest payment is due 30 days later on January 15. Both the company and the bank have accounting years which end on December 31.
The accrued interest as of December 31 is $50 ($20,000 X 6% = $1,200 per year = $100 per month = $50 for 1/2 month).
The company's adjusting entry will debit Interest Expense for $50, and will credit Accrued Interest Payable for $50.
The bank's adjusting entry will debit Accrued Interest Receivable for $50, and will credit Interest Revenue for $50.",what
Where should I enter unpaid wages?,"Definition of Unpaid Wages
Unpaid wages are usually the amounts that hourly-paid employees have earned, but have not yet been paid to the employees. 
Entering Unpaid Wages
Under the accrual basis of accounting, unpaid wages that have been earned by employees but have not yet been recorded in the accounting records should be entered or recorded through an accrual adjusting entry which will:

Debit Wages Expense
Credit Wages Payable or credit Accrued Wages Payable

Wages Expense is an income statement account. Wages Payable or Accrued Wages Payable is a current liability account that is reported on the balance sheet.",what
Would you please explain unearned income?,"Definition of Unearned Income
Unearned income or deferred income is a receipt of money before it has been earned. This is also referred to as deferred revenues or customer deposits. The unearned amount is initially recorded in a liability account such as Deferred Income, Deferred Revenues, or Customer Deposits. As the amount is earned, the liability account is reduced and the amount earned will be reported on the income statement as revenues.
Example #1 of Unearned Income
A lawn service company offers customers a special package of five applications of fertilizers and weed treatments for $300. However, the customer must prepay in December for the five treatments that will be done between April and September. When the company receives the $300 in December, it will debit the asset Cash for $300 and will credit the liability account Unearned Revenues. Since these are balance sheet accounts (and since no work has yet been performed), there are no revenues to be reported in December. In April when the first service is provided, the company will debit the liability account Unearned Revenues for $60 and will credit the income statement account Service Revenues for $60. At the end of April, the balance sheet will report the company's remaining liability of $240. The income statement for April will report the $60 that was earned. The $60 entry is referred to as an adjusting entry and the same entry will be recorded when each of the remaining four treatments are provided.
Example #2 of Unearned Income
A company informs a new customer that a $5,000 deposit is required before it will begin work on the customer's special order. The customer gives the company $5,000 on December 28 and the company will begin work on the special order on January 3. On December 28 the company will debit Cash for $5,000 and will credit a liability account, such as Customer Deposits (or Unearned Revenues or Deferred Revenues) for $5,000. No revenue is reported in December for this special order since the company did not perform any work in December. When the special order begins and is completed in January, the company will debit the liability account for $5,000 and will credit a revenue account.",what
What is inventory change and how is it measured?,"Definition of Inventory Change
Inventory change is the difference between the amount of last period's ending inventory and the amount of the current period's ending inventory.
Under the periodic inventory system, there may also be an income statement account with the title Inventory Change or with the title (Increase) Decrease in Inventory. This account is presented as an adjustment to purchases in determining the company's cost of goods sold. 
Example of Inventory Change
Let's assume that last year's ending inventory was $100,000 and the current year's ending inventory is $115,000. Under the periodic inventory system, this inventory increase of $15,000 could be recorded as a debit of $15,000 to Inventory (thereby increasing the account balance from $100,000 to $115,000, and as a credit of $15,000 to Inventory Change.
Next, assume that the company's net purchases for the year amounted to a net debit of $300,000. This $300,000 debit and the credit of $15,000 in Inventory Change results in the cost of goods sold of $285,000. The logic is that not all $300,000 of net purchases should be matched against sales since $15,000 of the purchases were added to inventory. (This is an alternative to the method used in introductory accounting textbooks, which is: beginning inventory of $100,000 + net purchases of $300,000 = $400,000 of cost of goods available – ending inventory of $115,000 = cost of goods sold of $285,000.)
Alternatively, if last year's ending inventory was $100,000 and the current year's ending inventory is $93,000, there will be a credit to Inventory for $7,000 and a debit to Inventory Change for $7,000. When the debit of $7,000 in the Inventory Change account is combined with the debit of $300,000 in net purchases, the cost of goods sold is $307,000. (The alternative is: beginning inventory of $100,000 + net purchases of $300,000 = cost of goods available of $400,000 – ending inventory of $93,000 = cost of goods sold of $307,000.)",what
Why are loan costs amortized?,"Definition of Loan Costs
Loan costs may include legal and accounting fees, registration fees, appraisal fees, processing fees, etc. that were necessary costs in order to obtain a loan.
If the loan costs are significant, they must be amortized to interest expense over the life of the loan because of the matching principle.
Example of Amortizing Loan Costs
Assume that a company incurs loan costs of $120,000 during February in order to obtain a $4 million loan at an annual interest rate of 9%. The loan will begin on March 1 and the entire $4 million of principal will be due five years later. In addition to the one-time loan costs of $120,000 the company will also have the cost of the borrowed money which is $360,000 ($4 million X 9%) of interest each year for five years.
It would be misleading to report the entire $120,000 of loan costs as an expense for the month of February. Hence, the matching principle requires that each month during the life of the loan the company should report $2,000 ($120,000 divided by 60 months) of loan costs as interest expense in addition to the interest expense of $30,000 per month ($4 million X 9% per year = $360,000 per year divided by 12 months per year). The combination of the monthly amortization of $2,000 and the monthly interest expense of $30,000 results in total monthly interest expense of $32,000 for each of the 60 months beginning on March 1.",what
What are the effects of depreciation?,"Definition of Depreciation
Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the cost of a company's assets used in its business from the balance sheet to the income statement (as an expense) over their estimated useful lives.
Depreciation occurs through an accounting adjusting entry in which the account Depreciation Expense is debited and the contra asset account Accumulated Depreciation is credited.
Effects of Depreciation
The following are some of the effects for a corporation that is depreciating assets:

The net income, retained earnings, and stockholders' equity are reduced with the debit to Depreciation Expense
The carrying value of the assets being depreciated and amount of total assets are reduced by the credit to Accumulated Depreciation
The depreciation expense reported on the U.S. income tax return (based on the tax regulations) reduces a corporation's taxable income (and its related income tax payments).",what
What is a noncash expense?,"Definition of a Noncash Expense
A noncash expense is an expense that is reported on the income statement of the current accounting period, but the related cash payment took place in another accounting period.
Example of a Noncash Expense
Perhaps the most common example of a noncash expense is depreciation. To illustrate, let's assume that a company purchased equipment two years ago for a cash payment of $200,000. The company determined that the equipment had a useful life of 10 years. As a result, the company's income statement will report depreciation expense of $20,000 a year for 10 years. The current year's income statement is reporting depreciation expense of $20,000 but there is no cash payment in the current year for this expense. This is why depreciation expense is referred to as a noncash expense.
This also explains why the operating activities section of the statement of cash flows usually begins with a company's net income and then immediately adds the period's depreciation expense. In effect the noncash depreciation expense is added back because the depreciation expense had reduced the company's net income reported on the income statement, but it did not use any cash during that period of time.",what
When should costs be expensed and when should costs be capitalized?,"Definition of Costs
In the context of the question, costs are the amounts paid in exchange for materials, products, or services. The costs could be:

Reported as an expense on the current period's income statement, or
Reported as an asset and expensed later. To defer the cost to the balance sheet is to capitalize the costs.

Examples of Costs Being Expensed
Costs are reported as expenses  in the accounting period when they are used up, have expired, or have no future economic value which can be measured. For example, the June salaries for the company's marketing team should be reported as an expense in June since the future economic value cannot be measured/determined.
Another example is the amount spent to repair equipment that broke in June and was repaired in June. The cost of the repair merely restored the equipment to its same condition. Since there was no additional future economic value added, the costs of repair is reported as an expense on the June income statement.
Example of Costs Being Capitalized
Costs are capitalized (recorded as assets) when the costs have not been used up and have future economic value. Assume that a company incurs a cost of $30,000 in June to add a hydraulic lift to its delivery truck that had no lift. The remaining useful life of the truck and the lift is 5 years. The cost of $30,000 should be capitalized since it added future economic value by making an improvement to the truck. The $30,000 cost increases the company's assets, but will be reduced by depreciating the cost to expense over the next 5 years.",what
Why is there a difference in the amounts for Bad Debts Expense and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts?,"Amount Reported as Bad Debts Expense
The amount reported in the income statement account Bad Debts Expense pertains to the estimated losses from extending credit during the period shown in the heading of the income statement. The estimated amount of Bad Debts Expense could be based on:

A percentage of the company's credit sales during the period, or
The change in the total amount needed in the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts based upon the amounts customers owe on the company's accounts receivable
Amount Reported as Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
The balance reported in the balance sheet account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is the estimated amount of Accounts Receivable that will not be collected. The balance in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts could be based upon:

An aging of the detailed amounts in Accounts Receivable
The result of recording the credit part of the entries to Bad Debts Expense that were based on a percentage of credit sales

Example of Bad Debts Expense and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
To illustrate, let's assume that on December 31 a company had $100,000 in Accounts Receivable and its balance in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts was a credit balance of $3,000. As a result, the December 31 balance sheet will be reporting that $97,000 will be turning to cash. During the first 30 days of January the company does not have any other information on bad accounts receivable. However, on January 31 the company learns that an additional $1,000 of its accounts receivable may not be collected. Therefore, on January 31 the company will make an adjusting entry to debit Bad Debts Expense for $1,000 and to credit Allowance for Doubtful Accounts for $1,000. After this entry is recorded, the company's income statement for the month of January will report Bad Debts Expense of $1,000 and its January 31 balance sheet will report a credit balance in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts in the amount of $4,000.",what
What is accrued income?,"Definition of Accrued Income
Accrued income is an amount that:

A company has earned
The company has a right to receive
The collection is probable
Has not yet been recorded in the general ledger accounts

Under the accrual basis of accounting, accrued income is recorded with an accrual adjusting entry prior to issuing the financial statements.
Example of Accrued Income
One example of accrued income is the interest a company earns on a bond investment. To illustrate, let's assume that a company invested $100,000 on December 1 in a 6% $100,000 bond that pays $3,000 of interest on each June 1 and December 1. On December 31, the company will have earned one month's interest amounting to $500 ($100,000 x 6% per year x 1/12 of a year, or 1/6 of the semiannual $3,000). No interest will be received in December since it will be included in the $3,000 interest that will be received on June 1. The $500 of interest that has been earned during December, but not yet received nor previously recorded as of December 31, is accrued interest income.
The accrued interest income will be recorded with an accrual adjusting entry dated December 31 that debits Interest Receivable (a balance sheet account) for $500, and credits Interest Income (an income statement account) for $500.",what
What is the aging method?,"Definition of Aging Method
The aging method usually refers to the technique for estimating the amount of a company's accounts receivable that will not be collected. The estimated amount that will not be collected should be the credit balance in the contra asset account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. The debit balance in Accounts Receivable minus the credit balance in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts will result in the estimated amount of the receivables that will be converted to cash.
The aging method sorts each customer's unpaid invoices by invoice date into perhaps four columns:

Column 1 lists the invoice amounts that are not yet due
Column 2 lists the invoice amounts that are 1-30 days past due
Column 3 lists the invoice amounts that are 31-60 days past due
Column 4 lists the invoice amounts that are more than 61 days past due

Accounting software will likely have a feature that generates the aging of accounts receivable.
Example of Aging Method
Let's assume that a company's Accounts Receivable has a debit balance of $89,400. The aging method indicates that most of the customers are current. However, there are a few customers' invoices that are more than 60 days past due. Those past due accounts are reviewed closely and based on each customer's information it is estimated that approximately $7,400 of the $89,400 will not be collected. Therefore the credit balance in the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts must be $7,400. This will result in the balance sheet reporting Accounts Receivable (Net) of $82,000.",what
What is the difference between a deferred expense and a prepaid expense?,"Definition of Deferred Expense and Prepaid Expense
Deferred expense and prepaid expense both refer to a payment that was made, but due to the matching principle, the amount will not become an expense until one or more future accounting periods. Most of these payments will be recorded as assets until the appropriate future period or periods. Sometimes these amounts are referred to as prepayments.
Before a balance sheet is prepared, the accountant must review the deferrals/prepaids and move the appropriate amounts to expense.
Difference between Deferred Expense and Prepaid Expense
It appears that most accountants refer to the deferrals that will become expenses within one year of the balance sheet as prepaid expenses. The amount that has not been expensed as of the balance sheet date will be reported as a current asset.
The deferred expenses that will not become expenses within one year of the date of the balance sheet will be reported in the long-term asset section of the balance sheet under the classification of other assets. (An exception is the costs of issuing long-term bonds. This amount is reported on the balance sheet as a contra liability account along with Bonds Payable in the long-term liability section.)",what
Is a prepaid expense recorded initially as an expense?,"Definition of Prepaid Expense
A prepaid expense refers to an amount that a company has paid and a portion or all of it will be an expense in a later accounting period.
Example of a Prepaid Expense
A company with an accounting year ending on December 31 has a prepaid expense if on December 1, it paid $6,000 for insurance coverage from December 1 through May 31.
Recording a Prepaid Expense
A prepaid expense can be recorded initially as an expense or as a current asset. Either way, adjusting entries will be needed during the six months to be certain that:

The current month's insurance expense of $1,000 ($6,000/6 months) is reported on each month's income statement.
The unexpired amount of the prepaid insurance is reported on the balance sheet as of the last day of each month. For example, on December 31 the balance sheet must report $5,000. On January 31 the balance sheet must report $4,000, and so on.",what
What is the effect on the income statement when the allowance for uncollectible accounts is not established?,"Definition of Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts
The Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts or Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is a contra asset account that reduces the amount of accounts receivable to the amount that is more likely be collected.
The income statement account Bad Debts Expense is part of the adjusting entry that increases the balance in the Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts.
Effect of No Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts
If a company's balance sheet does not reduce its accounts receivable debit balance with a credit balance in Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts, the company is communicating that it is not anticipating any bad debts expense relating to its existing accounts receivable. Hence, the income statement is delaying the reporting of bad debts expense on its income statement until an account receivable is actually written off as uncollectible.",what
Are utility bills an expense or a liability?,"Definition of Utility Bills
Utility bills are invoices received by a company for the natural gas, electricity, water, and sewer charges that the company used during a previous month or other period of time. The usage and the amount of each bill is generally based on the meters located on the company's property. In other words, the utilities provide the gas, electricity, etc. in advance of being paid. Therefore, the company is receiving the gas, electricity, etc. before it pays for them and has a liability until the bills are paid. 
Example of Utility Bills
Let's assume that a retailer begins operations on December 1 and it uses natural gas for heating and it uses electricity for lighting and to operate its computers and equipment. Let's assume that the utility reads the meters on the last day of every month and prepares the utility bills based on the meters' readings. The retailer receives its first utility bills on January 8th and must remit the amount by February 2.
Under the accrual basis of accounting, the retailer's income statement for the month of December must report the cost of the gas and electricity that it used during December. On its December 31 balance sheet, the retailer must report the amounts it owes to the utilities as of December 31.
If the utility bills for December's usage are not available at the time that the retailer's financial statements are prepared, the retailer will record an accrual adjusting entry that debits Utilities Expense and credits Accrued Utilities Payable for December's estimated amount.
In our example, the utility bills for gas and electricity used in December are both an expense and a liability as of December 31. When the utility bills are paid, the liability is eliminated.",what
Is a loan payment an expense?,"Definition of Loan Payment
Generally a loan payment consists of:

An interest payment, which is an expense
A principal payment, which reduces the loan's principal balance

If the interest and principal portions of the loan payment are not listed, a loan amortization schedule will indicate the amounts.
If the loan payments are made on the last day of every month, the interest payment (or interest portion of the loan payment) will likely be the expense for the month. However, if the loan payment is made on a different day of the month, an accrual adjusting entry will be required to report the precise amount of interest for the month and the accrued interest liability at the end of the month.
The loan's principal balance is a liability such as Loans Payable or Notes Payable. The principal payments that are required in the next 12 months should be classified as a current liability. The remaining amount of principal owed should be classified as a long-term (or noncurrent) liability.
Example of Loan Payment
A company makes monthly payments of $500.00 on the last day of every month. Each month the interest portion decreases and the principal portion increases (as the result of a decreasing principal balance). A loan amortization schedule indicates that the interest portion of this month's payment is $112.49 and the principal portion is $387.51. Therefore, the loan payment will be recorded as follows:

Debit Interest Expense for $112.49
Debit Loan Payable for $387.51
Credit Cash for $500.00",what
What does overstated mean?,"Definition of Overstated
When an accountant uses the term overstated, it means two things:

The reported amount is incorrect, and
The reported amount is more than the true or correct amount.

As a result of double-entry accounting or bookkeeping, another item is likely to have a reporting error.
Example of Overstated
If a company reports that its prepaid insurance is $8,000, but the true or correct amount of prepaid insurance is only $7,000, the accountant will say that the reported amount of prepaid insurance is overstated by $1,000.
Because of double-entry accounting, if the balance in the account Prepaid Insurance is overstated (too much is being reported) it is likely that the account Insurance Expense will be understated (too little is being reported).",what
What is accrued payroll?,"Definition of Accrued Payroll
Accrued payroll includes wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses, and other payroll related expenses that have been earned by a company's employees, but have not yet been paid or recorded in the company's general ledger accounts.
Example of Accrued Payroll
Let's assume that a retailer's hourly-paid employees are paid each Friday for the hours they worked during the previous week. Let's also assume that as of December 31, the hours worked from December 27 through December 31 will be part of the payroll that will be processed in early January and paid to the employees on Friday, January 8. The amount of the wages for the five days of December 27 through December 31 are calculated to be $5,000. In addition, the retailer incurred payroll taxes and fringe benefits amounting to $1,000. Therefore, the total amount of accrued payroll is $6,000.
Under the accrual basis of accounting, the retailer must report the $6,500 of accrued payroll as:

An expense on its income statement for the period ended December 31
Current liability on its balance sheet as of December 31

The retailer will accomplish this by preparing an accrual adjusting entry dated as of December 31.",what
How does an expense affect the balance sheet?,"Definition of Expense
An expense is a cost that has been used up, expired, or is directly related to the earning of revenues.
Most of a company's expenses fall into the following categories:

cost of goods sold
sales, general and administrative expenses
interest expense

How an Expense Affects the Balance Sheet
An expense will decrease a corporation's retained earnings (which is part of stockholders' equity) or will decrease a sole proprietor's capital account (which is part of owner's equity).
In addition to affecting retained earnings or the owner's capital account, an expense will also cause one or more of the following changes to the balance sheet:

A decrease in Cash, Prepaid Expenses, Supplies on Hand, Inventory
An increase in the credit balance in the contra-asset account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts or Accumulated Depreciation
An increase in the balance in the liability account Accounts Payable, or an increase in Accrued Expenses Payable (including Wages Payable, Interest Payable, etc.)",what
How do you record the interest that is unpaid on a note payable?,"Definition of Interest Unpaid on Note Payable
Interest that has occurred, but has not been paid as of a balance sheet date, is referred to as accrued interest.
Under the accrual basis of accounting, the amount that has occurred but is unpaid should be recorded with a debit to Interest Expense and a credit to the current liability Interest Payable.
Example of Recording Unpaid Interest
Let's assume that on December 10, a company made its monthly payment on a loan and the payment included interest through December 10. On the company's financial statements dated December 31, the company will need to report the interest expense and liability for December 11 through 31. This is done with an accrual adjusting entry dated December 31. If the interest for December 11 through December 31 was $100, the adjusting entry dated December 31 will debit Interest Expense for $100, and will credit Interest Payable for $100.",what
Where is accrued income reported in the balance sheet?,"Definition of Accrued Income
Accrued income refers to amounts that have been earned, but the amounts have not yet been received. For example, a corporation may have its excess cash invested in an investment security that pays interest every six months. Between the interest payment dates, the company will have:

Accrued interest income that is to be reported on the income statement
Accrued interest receivable that is to be reported on the balance sheet

Accrued Income Reported on the Balance Sheet
The amount of accrued income that a corporation has a right to receive as of the date of the balance sheet will be reported in the current asset section of the balance sheet. It could be described as accrued receivables or accrued income.
The amount of the accrued income reported on the income statement also causes an increase in a corporation's retained earnings, which is part of the stockholders' equity section of the balance sheet.
Balance Sheet: Retail/Wholesale - Corporation",what
What is a contingent asset?,"Definition of Contingent Asset
A contingent asset is a potential asset that is associated with a potential gain. The asset and gain are contingent because they are dependent upon some future event occurring or not occurring.
Because of the concept of conservatism, a contingent asset and gain will not be recorded in a general ledger account or reported on the financial statements until they are certain. [This is different from contingent liabilities and contingent losses, which are recorded in accounts and reported on the financial statements when they are probable and the amount can be estimated.
Example of Contingent Asset
An example of a contingent asset (and its related contingent gain) is a lawsuit filed by Company A against a competitor for infringing on Company A's patent. Even if it is probable (but not certain) that Company A will win the lawsuit, it is a contingent asset and a contingent gain. As such, it will not be recorded in Company A's general ledger accounts until the lawsuit is settled. (At most, Company A could prepare a carefully worded disclosure stating that it has filed the lawsuit but the outcome is uncertain.)",what
What is insurance expense?,"Definition of Insurance Expense
Under the accrual basis of accounting, insurance expense is the cost of insurance that has been incurred, has expired, or has been used up during the current accounting period for the nonmanufacturing functions of a business.
A manufacturer will report on its income statement the insurance expense incurred for its selling, general and administrative functions. However, the insurance costs associated with the manufacturing function are included in the cost of the current period's output. Any prepaid insurance costs are to be reported as a current asset.
Example of Insurance Expense
Let's assume that a retailer has insurance policies for its property, general liability, vehicles, and employees' worker compensation, medical, dental, life, and disability. The company pays the premiums on the various insurance policies in advance. Any insurance premium costs that have not expired as of the balance sheet date should be reported as a current asset such as Prepaid Insurance. The costs that have expired should be reported in income statement accounts such as Insurance Expense, Fringe Benefits Expense, etc. Here's a recap for the cost of insurance at the retailer:

Expired insurance premiums are reported as Insurance Expense.
Unexpired insurance premiums are reported as Prepaid Insurance (an asset account).

If the retailer has incurred some insurance expense but has not yet paid the premiums, the retailer should debit Insurance Expense and credit Insurance Premiums Payable.",what
Are the goods purchased by a retailer an expense or an asset?,"Definition of Goods Purchased by a Retailer
The goods purchased by a retailer are the products or merchandise that it buys and plans to resell.
The goods that are sold during the accounting period must be reported on the retailer's income statement as the cost of goods sold. 
The goods that are unsold at the end of the accounting period must be reported on the retailer's balance sheet as inventory.
Accounting for the Goods Purchased
There are two ways to record the goods at the time the goods are purchased:

Their cost could be recorded in an expense account (such as Cost of Goods Sold)
Their cost could be recorded in an asset account (such as Inventory)

Either way, the Inventory account must be adjusted to the actual amount. The other part of the adjusting entry is recorded in the income statement account.
Examples of Accounting for Goods Purchased
Assume that a retailer begins the year with inventory having a cost of $800. It ends the year with inventory having a cost of $900. During the year the retailer purchased goods at a cost of $7,000. Let's also assume that the cost per unit did not change during the year.
If the retailer records the $7,000 of purchases as an expense (cost of goods sold), then at the end of the year the retailer's adjusting entry must debit Inventory for $100 (since the inventory has increased from $800 to $900). The other account in this adjusting entry is the expense Cost of Goods Sold which is credited for $100. As a result, the income statement will report the cost of goods sold at $6,900 ($7,000 minus the $100 credit). The balance sheet will report inventory of $900 ($800 plus the debit of $100).
If the retailer records the $7,000 of purchases as an asset, the Inventory account balance increases from $800 to $7,800. Since the actual inventory at the end of the year is $900, the adjusting entry must credit Inventory for $6,900 ($7,800 minus $900) and debit Cost of Goods Sold for $6,900.
Regardless of whether the goods purchased were initially recorded as an expense or as an asset, the amounts must be adjusted so that the financial statements report the expense (reported as the cost of goods sold on the income statement for the year) at $6,900 and the asset inventory (reported on the balance sheet as of the end of the year) at $900.",what
What is the difference between an unadjusted trial balance and an adjusted trial balance?,"Difference between Unadjusted Trial Balance and Adjusted Trial Balance
The differences between an unadjusted trial balance and an adjusted trial balance are the amounts in the adjusting entries.
Examples of Adjusting Entries
Adjusting entries that will result in a difference between the unadjusted trial balance and the adjusted trial balance include the following:

The accrual of expenses that were incurred but were not yet recorded
The accrual of revenues that were earned but were not yet recorded
The deferral of a payment to the balance sheet until it becomes an expense in a future accounting period
The deferral of a receipt to the balance sheet until it is earned in a future accounting period
Adjustments to previous recorded deferrals that now belong on the income statement",what
How do you record an asset that was partially financed?,"Example of Recording an Asset that was Partially Financed
Assume that your company purchased a car for $10,000 by paying cash of $4,000 and signing a promissory note for $6,000.
The accounting entry is:

Debit the asset account Automobiles for the cost of $10,000
Credit the asset account Cash for the $4,000 that was paid
Credit the liability account Notes Payable for $6,000

The liability account Notes Payable reports the principal amount owed at the time. Interest that will occur in the future is not recorded at the time of the purchase. The reason is that the interest is not owed as of that date.
Each month, one month's interest on the note or loan should be recorded with a debit to Interest Expense and a credit to Cash or Interest Payable (if the interest was not paid). Any cash payments that exceed the amount of interest owed at the time of the payment should be debited to Notes Payable. The balance in the liability account Notes Payable should agree with the principal balance owed to the lender. The balance in the liability account Interest Payable should agree with the interest due as of that date.
You can call the lender to verify the amount of principal and interest owed at a specific date and then compare the amounts to the balances in your general ledger accounts.",what
What is an accounting period?,"Definition of Accounting Period
An accounting period is the period of time covered by a company's financial statements. Common accounting periods for external financial statements include the calendar year (January 1 through December 31) and the calendar quarter (January 1 through March 31, April 1 through June 30, July 1 through September 30, October 1 through December 31). It is common for these companies to also have monthly accounting periods. However, the financial statements for the monthly accounting periods are likely to be used only by the companies' managements.
In the U.S., some companies have annual accounting periods that end on dates other than December 31. For example, a company could have a fiscal year of July 1 through the following June 30. Its quarterly accounting periods would be July 1 through September 30, etc.
It is also common for U.S. retailers to have accounting periods that end on a Saturday. The annual accounting period for these businesses may be the 52- or 53-week fiscal years ending on the Saturday closest to February 1 or any other date. The retailers' quarterly accounting periods will be the 13-week periods, and the monthly accounting periods will be a 4- or 5-week time period. 
Examples of Accounting Periods
The following are some examples of accounting periods used by U.S. companies:

Annual calendar year of January 1 through December 31
Annual fiscal year such as July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020; April 1, 2019 through March 31, 2020; etc.
52- or 53-week fiscal year such as the 52 or 53 weeks ending on the last Saturday of January, etc.
Calendar quarters such as January 1 through March 31, April 1 through June 30, etc.

Fiscal quarters such as May 1 through July 31, August 1 through October 31, etc.
13-week fiscal quarters such as the 13 weeks ending on the last Saturday in April, etc.
Calendar months such as March 1 through March 31, November 1 through November 30, etc.
4- or 5-week fiscal months such as the 4 weeks ending the last Saturday of February, etc.",what
What is the difference between adjusting entries and closing entries?,"Definition of Adjusting Entries
Adjusting entries are made at the end of the accounting period (but prior to preparing the financial statements) in order for a company's financial statements to be up-to-date on the accrual basis of accounting.
Examples of Adjusting Entries
The following are hypothetical examples of adjusting entries:

Each day the company incurs wages expense for its hourly-paid employees. However, the payroll that includes the workers' wages for the last few days of the month won't be recorded until after the accounting period ends. Therefore, the company must prepare an adjusting entry dated for the last day of the month that debits Wages Expense and credits Wages Payable for the labor used and the amount owed.
Similarly, the company uses electricity each day but receives only one bill per month, perhaps on the 20th day of the month (for electricity used through the 15th day of the month). The cost of the electricity used during the last half of the month must get into the accounting records through an adjusting entry for the financial statements to show all of the expenses for the month and all of the liabilities as of the end of the month.
Another adjusting entry records the depreciation of assets used in the business. Every month the company must prepare an adjusting entry that debits Depreciation Expense and credits Accumulated Depreciation to report the month's depreciation.

Definition of Closing Entries
Closing entries are dated as of the last day of the accounting period, but are entered into the accounts after the financial statements are prepared. Closing entries involve the temporary accounts (the majority of which are the income statement accounts).
Example of Closing Entries
The closing entries will transfer all of the year-end balances from the revenue accounts and the expense accounts to a corporation's retained earnings account or a sole proprietorship's owner's equity account. With today's accounting software, the closing entries are effortless.",what
What is cost incurred?,"Definition of Cost Incurred
A cost incurred is a cost that a company (or other organization) becomes liable for.
Example of Cost Incurred
Assume that a retailer begins operations on December 1 and its electric meter is read by the utility on the last day of every month. During December the retailer will have incurred the cost of the electricity it used during December.
Under the accrual basis of accounting the retailer must report a current liability on December 31 for the amount owed to the utility for the electricity it used to that point. On its income statement for December, the retailer must also report electricity expense for the cost of the electricity that it used during December. This may require the retailer to record an accrual adjusting entries with an estimated amount (if the electricity bill is not received in time).",what
What are accrued revenues and when are they recorded?,"Accrued revenues are fees and interest that have been earned and sales that occurred, but they have not yet been recorded through the normal invoicing paperwork. Since these are not yet in the accountant's general ledger, they will not appear on the financial statements unless an adjusting entry is entered prior to preparing the financial statements.
Here's an example. Your company lent a supplier $100,000 on December 1. The agreement is for the $100,000 to be repaid on February 28 along with $3,000 of interest for the three months of December through February. As of December 31 your company will not have a transaction/invoice/receipt for the interest it is earning since all of the interest is due on February 28. Without an adjusting entry to accrue the revenue it earned in December, your company's financial statements as of December 31 will not be reporting the $1,000 (one-third of the $3,000 of interest) that it has earned in December. In order for the financial statements to be correct on the accrual basis of accounting, the accountant needs to record an adjusting entry dated as of December 31. The adjusting entry will consist of a debit of $1,000 to Interest Receivable (a balance sheet account) and a credit of $1,000 to Interest Income or Interest Revenue (income statement accounts).",what
Why are accruals needed every month?,"Reasons for Monthly Accruals
Accrual adjusting entries are needed monthly only if a company issues monthly financial statements.
Two reasons for the monthly accrual adjusting entries are:

To report the revenues and the related receivables which were earned during the month, but the transactions had not been recorded in the accounts as of the end of the month
To record the expenses, losses, and their related liabilities which were incurred during the month, but the transactions had not been recorded in the accounts as of the end of the month

Monthly accruals and deferrals and other adjusting entries must be recorded prior to issuing monthly financial statements in order to comply with the accrual basis of accounting.",what
What are the two methods for recording prepaid expenses?,"Definition of Prepaid Expenses
Prepaid expenses refers to payments made in advance and part of the amount will become an expense in a future accounting period. A common example is paying a 6-month insurance premium in December that provides coverage from December 1 through May 31. 
Examples of Two Methods for Recording Prepaid Expenses
One method for recording a prepaid expense is to record the entire payment in an asset account. For example, assume that on December 1 a company pays an insurance premium of $2,400 for 6 months of liability insurance coverage:

On December 1 the company debits Prepaid Insurance for $2,400 and credits Cash for $2,400
On the last day of December and on the last day of the following 5 months the company needs to record an adjusting entry that debits Insurance Expense for $400 ($2,400 divided by 6 months) and credits Prepaid Insurance for $400

A second method of recording a prepaid expense is to record the entire payment in the expense account. Using the information above, the following entries will occur:

On December 1 the company debits Insurance Expense for $2,400 and credits Cash for $2,400
On the last day of December the company records an adjusting entry that debits the asset account Prepaid Insurance for $2,000 ($2,400 divided by 6 months times the 5 months that will be prepaid as of December 31) and credits Insurance Expense for $2,000
At the end of each of the following 5 months the adjusting entry will debit Insurance Expense for $400 and will credit Prepaid Insurance for $400

Either method for recording prepaid expenses could be used as long as the asset account balance is equal to the unexpired or unused cost as of each balance sheet date.",what
Does sales commission get reported in the income statement?,"Sales commissions earned by a company would be reported as revenue in the company's income statement. Sales commissions that a company must pay to others are reported as an expense.
Under the accrual basis of accounting (as opposed to the cash basis) commission revenues should be reported when the company earns the commissions. The commission expense should be reported when the company has incurred the expense and liability. (This would also be the time when the other party has earned the commissions and the right to receive them.)
The commission revenues would be reported as operating revenue (in the section where sales are reported), if the commissions are earned as a main activity of the company. If the commissions are incidental or involve a peripheral activity, these commission revenues would be reported as other income.
Commission expense would be reported as a selling expense along with other operating expenses when they are related to the company's main activities. If a commission expense pertains to a peripheral activity, it would be reported as other expense.",what
What is a deferral?,"Definition of Deferral
A deferral often refers to an amount that was paid or received, but the amount cannot be reported on the current income statement since it will be an expense or revenue of a future accounting period. In other words, the future amount is deferred to a balance sheet account until a later accounting period when it will be moved to the income statement.
Deferral is also used to describe the  type of adjusting entries used to defer amounts at the end of an accounting period.
Examples of a Deferral
Assume that a company with an accounting year ending on December 31 pays a six-month insurance premium of $12,000 on December 1 with insurance coverage beginning on December 1. One-sixth of the $12,000, or $2,000, should be reported as insurance expense on the December income statement. The remaining $10,000 is deferred by reporting it as a current asset such as prepaid insurance, on its December 31 balance sheet.
A deferral also occurs with revenues. The insurance company receiving the $12,000 for the six-month insurance premium beginning December 1 should report $2,000 as insurance premium revenues on its December income statement. The remaining $10,000 should be deferred to a balance sheet liability account, such as Unearned Premium Revenues. In each subsequent month the insurance company will record an adjusting entry to reduce the liability account Unearned Premium Revenues by $2,000 and report $2,000 as Premium Revenues on its income statement.",what
"If inventory is understated at the end of the year, what is the effect on net income?","If inventory is understated at the end of the year, the net income for the year is also understated.
Here's a brief explanation. If a company has a cost of goods available of $100,000 and it assigns too little of that cost to inventory, then too much of that cost will appear on the income statement as the cost of goods sold. Too much cost on the income statement will mean too little net income.
Another way to view this is through the accounting equation, Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity. If you assign too little of the cost of goods available to Assets, then the amount of Owner's Equity will be too little—caused by net income being too little.",what
What is accrued rent?,"Definition of Accrued Rent
Accrued rent is the amount of rent that has not yet been paid by the tenant or received by the landlord for a past period of time. [If the tenant always pays the monthly rent on the first day of every, there will never be any accrued rent.] 
Under the accrual method of accounting the tenant should report:

Rent Expense during the period of time that the space was occupied but was not paid, and
A current liability Rent Payable for the amount owed to the landlord at each balance sheet date

Under the accrual method of accounting and assuming that the amount will be collected, the landlord should report:

Rent Revenue (or Rental Income) during the period of time that the space was occupied but the rent was not received from the tenant, and
A current asset Rent Receivable for the amount owed by the tenant at each balance sheet date

Example of Accrued Rent
A landlord and tenant agree to a monthly rent of $1,000 for office space beginning on October 1. Each month's rent is to be paid on the first day of the month. The tenant paid the monthly rent on October 1 and November 1, but asked the landlord if the December rent could be paid on February 1 (when the tenant will be receiving a large payment from a client). The landlord is assured that all rent due will be paid by February 1. Assuming that the tenant and the landlord use the accrual method of accounting, the following accrual adjusting entries are needed prior to issuing the December 31 financial statements:

The tenant will debit Rent Expense for $1,000 and will credit Rent Payable for $1,000
The landlord will debit Rent Receivable for $1,000 and will credit Rent Revenues for $1,000",what
What is the difference between adjusting entries and correcting entries?,"Definition of Adjusting Entries
Generally, adjusting entries are required at the end of every accounting period so that a company's financial statements reflect the accrual method of accounting.
Adjusting entries involve at least one income statement account and at least one balance sheet account.
Examples of Adjusting Entries
The following are some examples of the need for adjusting entries:

To report expenses and losses along with the related liabilities for transactions that have occurred but are not yet recorded in the general ledger accounts
To report revenues and gains along with the related assets for transactions that have occurred but are not yet recorded in the general ledger accounts
To defer future expenses and the related assets that were included in a previously recorded transaction
To defer future revenues and the related liabilities that were included in a previously recorded transaction
To record depreciation expense and/or bad debts expense and the change in the related contra asset account

Definition of Correcting Entries
Correcting entries are journal entries made to correct an error in a previously recorded transaction. Correcting entries can involve any combination of income statement accounts and balance sheet accounts.
Examples of Correcting Entries
The following are two examples of the need for correcting entries:

To correct an erroneous amount used when recording a previous transaction
To move an amount from an incorrect account (that was used when recording a previous transaction) to the correct account",what
How should an interest only loan be recorded?,"Defintion of an Interest Only Loan
An interest only loan specifies that only interest payments are required during the life of the loan. No principal payment is required until the loan comes due.
Example of an Interest Only Loan
Assume that on July 1, a company borrows $100,000 with an annual interest rate of 12%. The interest for each month is to be paid on the last day of the month. No principal payment is required until the loan comes due in two years.
On July 1 the company records the loan as follows:

Debit Cash for $100,000 (the proceeds from the loan)
Credit Notes Payable for $100,000 (the principal amount that is due in two years)

Since the principal balance of $100,000 will not be reduced until two years later, the note payable is reported on the balance sheet as a noncurrent or long-term liability for the first year. During the second year the principal balance is reported as a current liability.
If the current month's interest is paid on the last day of each month, there will be no interest liability reported on the end-of-the-month balance sheets. Each month's payment of interest requires a credit to Cash and a debit to Interest Expense, which is reported on the monthly income statement.",what
What is the accrual method?,"The accrual method of accounting reports revenues on the income statement when they are earned even if the customer will pay 30 days later. At the time that the revenues are earned the company will credit a revenue account and will debit the asset account Accounts Receivable. (When the customer pays 30 days after the revenues were earned, the company will debit Cash and will credit Accounts Receivable.)
The accrual method of accounting also requires that expenses and losses be reported on the income statement when they occur even if payment will take place 30 days later. For example, if a company has a $15,000 repair done on December 15 and the vendor allows for payment on January 15, the company will report a repair expense and a liability of $15,000 as of December 15. (On January 15 the company will credit Cash and will debit the liability account.)
The accrual method of accounting, which is also known as the accrual basis of accounting, is required for large companies. (The cash method of accounting may be used by individuals and some small companies.) The accrual method and the associated adjusting entries will result in a more complete and accurate reporting of a company's assets, liabilities, equity, and earnings during each accounting period.",what
What is the difference between a contingent liability and an estimated liability?,"Definition of a Contingent Liability
A contingent liability is a potential liability (and a potential loss or potential expense). For a contingent liability to become an actual liability a future event must occur.
Examples of Contingent Liabilities
Assume someone files a lawsuit against Jay Corp. Jay Corp now has a contingent liability. The lawsuit will become an actual liability only if Jay Corp is unsuccessful in defending itself. (Many lawsuits are nuisance suits that will not be victorious in court.)
Another contingent liability is the warranty that automakers provide on new cars. Since it is probable (not merely possible) that some vehicles will require work during the warranty period and the automakers can estimate that amount, the estimated amount of the warranty cost will be reported as a liability on the automakers' balance sheets at the time that the cars are sold. The other part of the journal entry is to debit Warranty Expense and report it on the income statement.
Definition of an Estimated Liability
An estimated liability is a liability that is absolutely owed because the services or goods have been received. However, the vendors' invoices have not yet been received and the exact amount is not yet known. The company is required to estimate the amount since the estimated amount is far better than implying that no liability is owed and that no expense was incurred. Many of the accrual adjusting entries require estimated amounts.
Examples of Estimated Liabilities
Liabilities that are not contingent liabilities but are estimated liabilities include the following:

The electricity and natural gas consumed but the bill has not been received
An emergency repair that occurred but the bill has not been received
Real estate taxes that have occurred but the tax bill has not been received
Worker compensation insurance premiums which have occurred but the bill has not been received

These liabilities must be recorded by using estimated amounts.",what
What is the journal entry to record a one-year subscription for a magazine?,"Ways to Record One-Year Subscriptions
Let's assume that the cost of the one-year subscription for a monthly trade publication is $120. Let's also assume the payment is made at the start of the subscription period, and that your company prepares monthly financial statements.
One way to enter the transaction is to debit the current asset Prepaid Subscriptions for $120 and to credit Cash for $120. At the end of each month an adjusting entry would be prepared to debit Subscriptions Expense for $10 and to credit Prepaid Subscriptions for $10. This approach would obviously match the annual cost to each of the 12 monthly periods benefiting from the subscription. However, this is not practical given the small amount involved.
Thanks to the accounting concept of materiality, accountants can ignore the matching principle when the amount is insignificant in relationship to the company's size. Since no investor or lender would be misled if the entire $120 appeared as an expense in one month and $0 appeared in the other 11 months, the following entry would be more practical: debit Subscriptions Expense for $120 and credit Cash for $120 at the time of entering the invoice into the accounting records.
If an annual trade group membership fee is $6,000 and the amount is significant for the company, the company should record the payment as a prepaid asset and then write a monthly adjusting entry for $500.",what
What is the difference between a land improvement and a leasehold improvement?,"Examples of land improvements include paved parking areas, driveways, fences, outdoor lighting, and so on. Land improvements are recorded separately from land, because land improvements have a limited life and are depreciated. Land is assumed to last indefinitely and will not be depreciated.
Land improvements are recorded in a general ledger asset account entitled Land Improvements. The depreciation of land improvements will result in depreciation expense on the company's income tax return. This will reduce its taxable income and will reduce a profitable company's income tax payments.
An example of a leasehold improvement is the permanent improvement to a building that is being rented under a 10 year lease. For instance, the tenant might construct permanent walls and offices inside of the warehouse that it leases from the owner. The lease will likely state that all improvements to the building will belong to the owner of the building. The amount spent by the tenant to improve the building will be recorded by the tenant in its asset account Leasehold Improvements. Generally, the amount of these leasehold improvements will be depreciated by the tenant over the useful life of the improvements or over the life of the lease, whichever is shorter. The depreciation expense associated with the leasehold improvements will reduce the tenant's taxable income and its income tax payments if the company is profitable.",what
How many years is the appropriate time for depreciating leasehold improvements?,"Leasehold improvements should be depreciated or amortized according to the lessee's normal depreciation policy except that the time period shall be the shorter of: 1) the useful life of the leasehold improvements, or 2) the remaining years of the lease. The remaining years of the lease include the years in the lease renewals that are reasonably assured.

What is the entry when a contract is signed?,"Accounting Entry When Signing a Contract
Merely signing a contract does not by itself require a journal entry. In other words, signing a contract for a future transaction does not mean the company is increasing or decreasing an asset or a liability at the time of the signing. Of course, if cash or some other asset is exchanged at the time of the signing, it will have to be recorded.
While a journal entry is not required at the time the contract is signed, significant commitments that are contained in the contract must be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements of the parties to a noncancelable contract.
Examples of No Entry When Signing a Contract
Assume that an electric utility signs a noncancelable contract with a coal company to purchase 100 million tons of coal to be delivered over a one-year period that will begin in three months. On the day the contract is signed, the electric utility does not own any of the coal specified in the contract, nor does it owe for any of the coal, since the coal will not be delivered for at least three months. When the first trainload of coal arrives at the electric utility at least three months later, the utility will record the purchase of only the coal that has arrived and the related account payable.
Likewise, on the day the contract is signed, the coal company does not have a sale of the coal specified in the contract, and it does not have a receivable from the electric utility. Three months later, when the first shipment of coal is delivered to the utility, the coal company will record a sale of the coal and a related account receivable.
If the commitments made by the utility and the coal company are significant, those commitments must be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements of both the utility and the coal company.",what
What is a promissory note?,"Definition of Promissory Note
A promissory note is a written promise to pay an amount of money by a specified date (or perhaps on demand). The maker of the promissory note agrees to pay the principal amount and interest.
The maker of the promissory note is known as the borrower or debtor and records the amount owed in a liability account such as Notes Payable. The person or organization that has the right to receive the money when the promissory note comes due is known as the lender or creditor and records that amount in an asset account such as Notes Receivable.
Under the accrual method of accounting, both the borrower and the lender must report any accrued interest  as of each balance sheet date. The maker/borrower of the note will report interest expense and interest payable. The creditor/lender will report the accrued interest as interest income and interest receivable.
Example of a Promissory Note
A promissory note is created when a company borrows money from its bank. However, a promissory note could also be used when a company is unable to pay one of its suppliers as agreed. In that situation, the supplier may demand that the company issue a promissory note. This results in the company replacing its account payable with a note payable, and the supplier replacing its account receivable with a note receivable.",what
What is the difference between Rent Receivable and Rent Payable?,"The asset account Rent Receivable is used by the landlord to report the amount of rent that has been earned by the landlord but has not been received from the tenant as of the balance sheet date. The liability account Rent Payable is used by the tenant to report the amount of rent that the tenant owes for rent but has not been paid as of the balance sheet date.
If the rent is to be paid on the first day of each month, and if the rent is paid on time, the landlord will have a zero balance in Rent Receivable. Similarly, the tenant will have a zero balance in Rent Payable. It is only if the tenant falls behind in making the rent payments that amounts will be entered into the Rent Receivable and Rent Payable accounts.",what
What is a deferred cost?,"A deferred cost is a cost that occurred in a transaction, but will not be expensed until a future accounting period.
An example of a deferred cost is the fees necessary to register a new bond issue. A company will likely have to pay attorneys and accountants to prepare and audit the many statements required by government agencies. When these fees are significant, they are recorded as deferred costs in the long-term liability account, Bond Issue Costs or Unamortized Bond Issue Costs. The amount of the deferred costs will then be amortized (systematically charged) to Interest Expense over the life of the bonds.
A second example is the amount paid in advance for the next six months of insurance. This prepayment is a deferred cost that is recorded in the current asset Prepaid Insurance. In each of the future months, one-sixth of the deferred amount of the insurance premium should be charged to Insurance Expense.
The capitalization of interest involved when a company constructs its own building is also a deferred cost. The reason is that the interest will be added to the cost of the building and depreciated over the life of the building—instead of being expensed immediately as interest expense.",what
What is the entry when merchandise has been received but not the vendor's invoice?,"If you received merchandise, but have not received the vendor's invoice by the end of the accounting period, you need to 1) debit Purchases (periodic method) or debit Inventory (perpetual method) for the cost of the goods or merchandise received, and 2) credit Accounts Payable. You also need to include the merchandise in your physical inventory.
When the vendor's invoice is received and processed, be sure to reverse (remove) the above entry.",what
What is the difference between unearned revenue and unrecorded revenue?,"In financial accounting, unearned revenue refers to amounts received prior to being earned. For example, if ABC Service Co. receives $24,000 on December 31, 2012 for a one-year service agreement covering January 1 through December 31, 2013, the entire $24,000 is unearned as of December 31, 2012. On the December 31, 2012 balance sheet ABC should report a liability such as Unearned Revenues for $24,000. During 2013 ABC should move $2,000 per month from the liability account on its balance sheet to a revenue account on its income statement.
I associate unrecorded revenue with revenues that were earned, but not yet recorded in a company's accounting records. For example, an electric utility will provide electricity to customers for up to one month before it reads the customers' meters, calculates the bills and records the billings as revenues and accounts receivable. As a result, the electric utility will have up to one month of unrecorded revenue. At each balance sheet date, the utility should accrue for the revenues it earned but had not yet recorded. This is done through an adjusting entry that debits a balance sheet receivable account and credits an income statement revenue account.",what
How do you calculate the payroll accrual?,"The payroll accrual is the amount that needs to be entered into a liability account in order for the credit balance in the liability account to be the amount owed to employees. The amount owed is the amount the employees have earned from working, but as of the date of the balance sheet this amount has not been paid to the employees.
To illustrate the payroll accrual, assume that a company's employees were paid on September 30 for their work through September 25. The credit balance needed in the liability account as of September 30 is the amount that the employees earned for the days of September 26 through September 30.",what
What is straight line depreciation?,"Straight line depreciation is likely to be the most common method of matching a plant asset's cost to the accounting periods in which it is in service. Under the straight line method of depreciation, each full accounting year will be allocated the same amount or percentage of an asset's cost. (The total amount of depreciation over the years of the asset's useful life will be the asset's cost minus any expected or assumed salvage value.)
To illustrate straight line depreciation let's assume that a company purchases equipment at a cost of $430,000 and it is expected to be used in the business for 10 years. At the end of the 10 years, the company expects to receive a salvage value of $30,000. Under the straight line method each full accounting year will be allocated $40,000 of depreciation, which is one-tenth (1/10) or 10% of the $400,000 that needs to be depreciated over the useful life of the equipment. If the asset is purchased in the middle of the accounting year there will be $20,000 of depreciation in the first and the eleventh accounting year and $40,000 in each of the years 2 through 10.
In the U.S. a company may use the straight line method for its financial statements while at the same time be using the Internal Revenue Service's faster depreciation on its federal income tax return.",what
Why would Prepaid Insurance have a credit balance?,"Several situations could cause a credit balance in the asset account Prepaid Insurance. For example, let's assume a company's insurance has a cost of $600 every six months. As a result, the company decides to debit Prepaid Insurance when the amount is paid semiannually. It also prepares an automatic monthly adjusting entry to debit Insurance Expense $100 and to credit Prepaid Insurance for $100. If one of the $600 payments is debited to Insurance Expense (or another account) instead of Prepaid Insurance, the monthly adjusting entries will cause the balance in the Prepaid Insurance account to become a credit balance.
Another possibility is that the company simply failed to pay the insurance company and the monthly adjusting entries caused the balance in Prepaid Insurance to become a credit balance. Whatever the cause of the credit balance in Prepaid Insurance, the account balance needs to be adjusted before issuing a balance sheet. The Prepaid Insurance account must report the true amount that is prepaid (paid but not yet expired) as of the date of the balance sheet. If nothing is prepaid then the Prepaid Insurance account must show a zero balance. If an amount is owed to the insurance company, there should be a liability account with a credit balance for the amount owed as of the balance sheet date.
Because adjusting entries involve a balance sheet account and an income statement account, it is wise to also look at the amount being reported in the income statement account Insurance Expense. You should monitor both the Insurance Expense account balance and the Prepaid Insurance account balance throughout the year. The amount paid to the insurance company that has expired needs to be reported as an expense and the amount that has not yet expired needs to be reported as the asset Prepaid Insurance.",what
Where does accrued interest on notes receivable get reported on the balance sheet?,"Accrued interest on notes receivable is likely to be reported as a current asset such as Accrued Interest Receivable or Interest Receivable. The accrued interest receivable is a current asset if the interest amount is expected to be collected within one year of the balance sheet date.
I would expect that even a long-term note receivable that is due in five years will require that the interest on the note be paid quarterly, semiannually or annually. Hence the accrued interest will be a current asset.
If the interest on the note is not expected to be received within one year of the balance sheet date, then the accrued interest receivable should be reported as a long-term asset.",what
Why do we charge depreciation?,"We charge depreciation because most of the long-lived assets used in a business have 1) a significant cost, and 2) they will be useful only for a limited number of years. The matching principle (a basic underlying accounting principle) requires that the actual cost of these assets be allocated to the accounting periods in which the company will benefit from their use.
The depreciation reported on a U.S. corporation's external financial statements is computed by spreading an asset's cost (less any salvage value) over the asset's service life or useful life. For example, equipment with a cost of $500,000 and no salvage value at the end of an assumed useful life of 10 years will likely result in matching $50,000 to each full accounting year. (The U.S. income tax rules allow accelerating the depreciation amounts, but the total cannot exceed the asset's cost.)
Examples of the assets that must be depreciated include machinery, equipment, fixtures, furnishings, buildings, vehicles, etc. These assets are often referred to as fixed assets or plant assets, and the amounts spent are part of a corporation's capital expenditures. (Note that land is not depreciated because it is assumed to last indefinitely.)",what
Why do purchases appear as expenses on an income statement?,"Generally, the purchases of merchandise are sold in the year they are acquired. Hence, it is logical to match the current period's purchases as expenses on the same income statement that reports the current period's sales revenues.
If some of the purchases are not sold in the same period, there will be a change in inventory. An increase in the amount of inventory will appear on the income statement as a deduction to the current period's purchases. It is a deduction because some of the costs of the current period's purchases are not associated with the sales shown on the income statement. The deduction is reporting that some of the costs of purchases are being deferred to a later period when they will be sold. The deduction is necessary in order to achieve the matching principle: matching the proper amount of the costs of the goods sold with the sales revenues of the accounting period.
A decrease in the amount of inventory will appear on the income statement as an addition to the cost of the purchases. This recognizes that some of the sales included some costs of purchases that were made in an earlier accounting period.",what
What is the difference between reserve and provision?,"In the U.S. the use of the word reserve has been discouraged for several decades. In its place, the accounting profession has recommended the use of words such as allowance, accumulated, or provision. For instance, many years ago the contra account to a plant asset may have been titled Depreciation Reserve. To some readers, that name implied that cash had been set aside to replace the asset. To better communicate reality, the accounting profession recommended a more descriptive title such as Accumulated Depreciation. Similarly, the contra account to Accounts Receivable may have been titled Reserve for Bad Debts. Again, that title could imply that money was set aside. To avoid misinterpretation, the accounting profession suggested Allowance for Bad Debts or Provision for Bad Debts.
The word provision might appear in the title of a contra account as we just noted. In addition, provision will occasionally appear in the title of an expense account, such as Provision for Income Taxes.",what
What is separation of duties?,"The separation of duties is one of several steps to improve the internal control of an organization's assets. For example, the internal control of cash is improved if the money handling duties are separated from the record keeping duties. By separating these duties the likelihood of theft is reduced because it will now require two dishonest people working together to admit to each other that they are dishonest, plan the theft, and to then carry out the theft. One person will have to remove the cash and the other person will have to falsify the records.
Without the separation of duties, the theft of cash is easier. One dishonest person can steal the money and enter a fictitious amount into the records—thereby concealing the theft.
Another step in improving internal control over cash is to use a cash register, issue receipts, and have two people present when cash is handled.",what
What is accounts payable?,"Accounts payable may refer to:

A section of the accounting department that is responsible for processing vendor invoices and other bills for goods and services that a company received on credit.
The title of the current liability account containing the amounts owed for vendor invoices and other bills that have been approved but not yet paid. The balance in Accounts Payable is expected to be a credit balance.
Amounts owed which did not involve a promissory note. If a promissory note is involved, the account Notes Payable will be used instead of Accounts Payable.

If the company owes for goods and services and the amounts are not yet recorded in Accounts Payable, they must be entered with an adjusting entry at the end of the accounting period. The credit portion of the adjusting entry is likely to be recorded in a separate current liability account such as Accrued Expenses and Liabilities.
Accounts payable may also be referred to as trade payables.
To learn more about the various aspects of accounts payable, see our Explanation, Quiz, Q&A, and more.",what
When are expenses credited?,"While general ledger expense accounts are typically debited and have debit balances, there are times when the expense accounts are credited.
Some instances when general ledger expense accounts are credited include:

the end-of-year closing entries
the reversing entry for a previous accrual adjusting entry involving an expense
an adjusting entry to defer part of a prepayment that was debited to an expense account
a correcting entry to reclassify an amount from the incorrect expense account to the correct account",what
What is the difference between notes payable and notes receivable?,"A written promissory note is a note payable for the borrower and it is a note receivable for the lender. Hence, the promissory note is a liability for the borrower and it is an asset for the lender.
To illustrate, let's assume that Local Retailer borrows $20,000 from its bank and signs a promissory note. Local Retailer records $20,000 in its liability account Notes Payable and also records the $20,000 in its Cash account. The bank records the $20,000 promissory note in its asset account Notes Receivable and it records the $20,000 increase in its customer's checking account (which is a liability account on the bank's balance sheet).
Since the promissory note is a contract to pay interest at a specified date, it requires Local Retailer to report interest expense in each accounting period and to report interest payable for any interest owed at the end of an accounting period. The bank is required to report interest revenue in each accounting period and to report interest receivable for any interest it has earned but has not received as of the end of each accounting period.",what
Why is prepaid insurance a short term asset?,"Prepaid insurance is usually a short term or current asset because the prepaid amount will be used up or will expire within one year of the balance sheet date.
The definition of a short term or current asset is cash and other assets that will turn to cash or will be used up or consumed within one year of the balance sheet date. If a company's operating cycle is longer than one year, the definition allows for assets turning to cash, used up, or consumed during the operating cycle to be reported as a current asset.
Often companies are billed in advance for insurance premiums covering a one year period or less. Hence the prepaid amount is usually a current asset.
If a company would have to pay an insurance premium in advance for a period longer than one year, the portion of the prepayments that will not turn to cash within one year (or the operating cycle if it is longer than one year) would be reported as a long term asset.",what
What is the entry for the down payment from a signed contract?,"A down payment received before it is earned is recorded with a debit to the current asset account Cash and a credit to the current liability account Customer Deposits.
When the contract is completed, the account Customer Deposits will be debited for the amount of the down payment, the sale will be recorded with a credit, and Cash or Accounts Receivable will be debited.",what
How much do you depreciate an asset and when?,"Depreciation begins when you place an asset in service and it ends when you take an asset out of service or when you have expensed its cost, whichever comes first.
For financial statements, you are guided by the matching principle. The objective is to match the cost of the asset to the accounting periods in which revenues were earned by using the asset. There are two estimates needed: 1) the number of years that the asset will be used, and 2) the salvage value at the end of the asset's use. If an asset has a cost of $100,000 and is expected to be used for 10 years and then have no salvage value, most companies will depreciate the asset at the rate of $10,000 per year. This is known as the straight line method of depreciation.
For income tax purposes in the U.S., the Internal Revenue Service has determined the number of years that various assets will be useful and it assumes there will be no salvage value. The IRS also allows companies to take larger depreciation deductions in the earlier years and smaller deductions in the later years of the assets' lives. This is known as accelerated depreciation.
As you probably noted from the above information, in any one year the depreciation expense on the financial statements will be different from the depreciation expense on the income tax return. However, over the life of an asset, the total depreciation expense will be the same. Accountants refer to this as a timing difference.",what
What is the allowance method?,"Definition of Allowance Method
The allowance method usually refers to one of the two ways for reporting bad debts expense that results from a company selling goods or services on credit. (The other way is the direct write-off method.)
Under the allowance method, a company records an adjusting entry at the end of each accounting period for the amount of the losses it anticipates as the result of extending credit to its customers. The entry will involve the operating expense account Bad Debts Expense and the contra-asset account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. Later, when a specific account receivable is actually written off as uncollectible, the company debits Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and credits Accounts Receivable.
The allowance method is preferred over the direct write-off method because:

The income statement will report the bad debts expense closer to the time of the sale or service, and
The balance sheet will report a more realistic net amount of accounts receivable that will actually be turning to cash

The allowance method can be applied in one or both of the following ways:

Focusing on the bad debts expense that is needed on the income statement
Focusing on the balance needed in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts (which will be reported on the balance sheet)

Examples of Allowance Method
Let's assume that a corporation begins operations on November 1 in an industry where it is common to give credit terms of net 30 days. In this industry approximately 0.3% of credit sales will not be collected.
Next, let's assume that the corporation focuses on the bad debts expense. If the corporation's actual credit sales for November are $800,000 it will record an adjusting entry dated November 30 to debit Bad Debts Expense for $2,400 ($800,000 X 0.003) and credit Allowance for Doubtful Accounts for $2,400. As a result, its November income statement will be matching $2,400 of bad debts expense with the credit sales of $800,000. If the balance in Accounts Receivable is $800,000 as of November 30, the corporation will report Accounts Receivable (net) of $797,600.
Focusing on the balance in the account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, the corporation will adjust the balance in the account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts so that the combination of that credit balance and the debit balance in Accounts Receivable will be equal to the amount that is expected to turn to cash. The expected amount will likely be determined by aging the accounts receivable.
If the corporation prepares weekly financial statements, it might focus on the bad debts expense for its weekly financial statements, but at the end of each quarter focus on the allowance account.",what
What is contained on a 10-column worksheet?,"The 10-column worksheet that I am familiar with will have the general ledger account titles in the first column followed by ten columns of amounts. There will be one debit and one credit column for each of the following five headings:

Trial Balance containing each account's unadjusted balance,
Adjustments containing any adjusting entries,
Adjusted Trial Balance containing the combination of the unadjusted balance and any adjustments,
Income Statement containing the adjusted balances for the revenue, expense, gain and loss accounts, and
Balance Sheet containing the adjusted balances for the asset, liability and owner's equity accounts.

Under the Income Statement columns, the difference between the total of the debit column and the credit column is the amount of net income or net loss. If the total of the credit column is larger than the total of the debit column, it indicates a positive net income (revenues are greater than expenses). If the total of the debit column is larger than the total of the credit column it indicates a net loss (expenses are greater than revenues).",what
What are accrued liabilities?,"Definition of Accrued Liabilities
Accrued liabilities are usually expenses that have been incurred by a company as of the end of an accounting period, but the amounts have not yet been paid or recorded in the general ledger.
Accrued liabilities are recorded at the end of the accounting period by means of  adjusting entries. The amounts for some accrued liabilities and their related expenses (or losses) may have to be estimated.
Examples of Accrued Liabilities
Some examples of accrued liabilities include the following:

Services and purchases that have been received, but the vendors' invoices have not yet been recorded in Accounts Payable
Accrued employee wages and fringe benefits
Accrued management bonuses
Accrued interest on loans payable
Accrued advertising and promotion
Accrued product warranty costs",what
What is a deferred credit?,"A deferred credit could mean money received in advance of it being earned, such as deferred revenue, unearned revenue, or customer advances. A deferred credit could also result from complicated transactions where a credit amount arises, but the amount is not revenue.
A deferred credit is reported as a liability on the balance sheet. Depending on the specifics, the deferred credit might be a current liability or a noncurrent liability. In the past, it was common to see a noncurrent liability section with the heading Deferred Credits.",what
"Under accrual accounting, how are worker comp premiums handled?","Worker comp insurance premiums should be charged to the areas where the related wages and salaries are charged.
Let's assume that the net cost of worker comp insurance after discounts and dividends is 5% of the wages and salaries of direct and indirect manufacturing employees. If for the month of January the direct labor is $40,000, then $2,000 of the worker comp cost should be included as direct labor. If indirect labor for January is $60,000 then $3,000 of worker comp cost should be included as the cost of the indirect labor.
If the general office worker comp rates are 0.2% of the general office wages and salaries, then 0.2% of January's general office wages and salaries will be expensed as worker comp insurance expense.
If the employer remits each month's worker comp cost to its insurance company each accounting period, there will be no prepaid insurance nor will there be a liability for accrued worker comp expense.
If the employer remits worker comp premiums to the insurance company in advance of the cost associated with wages and salaries, the amount that is prepaid as of the balance sheet date should be reported as Prepaid Insurance, a current asset. If the employer has remitted less than the worker comp cost associated with the wages and salaries, the amount owed to the insurance company as of the balance sheet date is reported as a current liability such as Accrued Worker Comp Payable.",what
When do you adjust the amount of prepaid expenses?,"The balance in the current asset account Prepaid Expenses should be adjusted prior to issuing a company's financial statements. If the company issues financial statements for each calendar month, you will need to adjust the balance in Prepaid Expenses as of the end of each month. If your company issues only quarterly financial statements, you will need to adjust the balance at the end of each quarter.
The goal is to have the balance in Prepaid Expenses be equal to the amount of the unexpired costs as of the end of the accounting period (which is also the date appearing in the heading of the balance sheet).
Usually the adjusting entry for prepaid expenses will be a credit to Prepaid Expenses and a debit to the appropriate expense account(s). For instance, if Prepaid Expenses involve the prepayment of insurance premiums the adjusting entry will include a debit to Insurance Expense.",what
Is the reversal of a previous year's accrued expense permanent?,"Yes, a reversing entry is permanent.
To illustrate, let's assume that a company had accrued interest expense of $10,000 as of December 31, the end of its accounting year. The accrual adjusting entry will record an additional $10,000 of expense to be reported on the December income statement and an additional $10,000 liability on the December 31 balance sheet.
On January 1 the account Interest Expense will begin with a zero balance, since expenses are temporary accounts that are closed at the end of each accounting year. On January 2, a reversing entry is recoded which removes the $10,000 liability and causes a $10,000 credit balance in Interest Expense. The negative amount in Interest Expense will disappear as soon as the interest portion of the January loan payment is recorded.
The accrual entry on December 31 was needed only for the December financial statements. Early in January the December 31 accrued interest must be permanently removed or reversed because the actual interest will soon be recorded. The reversing entry will assure that the interest expense amount is reported only once.",what
Is it acceptable for companies to use two methods of depreciation?,"Yes, many companies use two or more methods of depreciation.
It is acceptable and common for companies to depreciate its plant assets by using the straight line method on its financial statements, while using an accelerated method on its income tax return.
A company could also be depreciating its equipment over ten years for its financial statements, while using seven years for its income tax return.
Even the depreciation for financial statements could consist of some assets being depreciated using the units of production or units of activity method, while other assets are depreciated using the straight line method.",what
What are wages payable?,"Definition of Wages Payable
Wages payable refers to the wages that a company's employees have earned, but have not yet been paid. Under the accrual method of accounting, this amount is likely recorded with an adjusting entry at the end of the accounting period so that the company's balance sheet will include the amount as a current liability. (The adjusting entry typically debits Wages Expense and credits Wages Payable.)
Example of Wages Payable
To illustrate wages payable we will use the following hypothetical dates and other information. Jane is an hourly-paid sales clerk at a company that ends its accounting year on December 31. During the work week of Sunday December 22 through Saturday December 28 Jane earned $400 of wages that the company will pay to her on January 2. For the last three days of the year (December 29-31) Jane earned $160. This amount (plus any wages she earns from January 1-4) will be included in her January 9 paycheck.
Given this information, the company has wages payable of $560 ($400 + $160) as of December 31.
Reporting Wages Payable on the Balance Sheet
The company's current liabilities on its December 31 balance sheet must include the $560 of wages payable that Jane had earned and the company owes as of December 31. (The company's income statement for the year that ends on December 31 must also report the $560 as part of its wages expense.)
The amount in the account Wages Payable (or Accrued Wages Payable) will often be reported on the balance sheet as part of a current liability description such as accrued compensation, accrued payroll liabilities, accrued expenses, accrued liabilities, etc.",what
What are accrual adjusting entries?,"Definition of Accrual Adjusting Entries
Accrual adjusting entries or simply accruals are one of three types of adjusting entries which are prepared at the end of an accounting period so that a company's financial statements will comply with the accrual method of accounting. Expressed another way, accrual adjusting entries are the means for including transactions that occurred during the current accounting period but have not yet been recorded in a company's general ledger accounts. Without accrual adjusting entries those transactions will likely be reported in a later accounting period. This means that the financial statements for two accounting periods will be reporting incorrect amounts.
Example of an Accrual Adjusting Entry for Expenses
To illustrate, let's assume that New Corp begins its business on December 1 and uses Sales Rep Company for calling on customers. For this service, New Corp agrees to pay commissions of 5% of sales with payment made 10 days after the month ends. Assuming that December's sales are $100,000 New Corp will be incurring commissions expense of $5,000 and a liability of $5,000. However, the payment will actually occur on January 10. Without an accrual adjusting entry as of December 31 New Corp's financial statements will have the following problems:

Its December income statement will report $0 commissions expense in getting December's sales of $100,000
Its January income statement will report $5,000 in commissions expense that were actually incurred in order to get December's sales
Its December 31 balance sheet will not be reporting its $5,000 liability to Sales Rep Company

In order for New Corp's December's income statement to match the $5,000 of commissions expense with December's sales of $100,000, and for New Corp's December 31 balance sheet to report the liability of $5,000, the following accrual adjusting entry is needed as of December 31: debit Commissions Expense for $5,000; credit Commissions Payable for $5,000.
Example of an Accrual Adjusting Entry for Revenues
Over at Sales Rep Company, for its financial statements to comply with the accrual method of accounting it needs to record the following accrual adjusting entry as of December 31 (assuming its billing will take place in early January): debit the asset account Commissions Receivable for $5,000; credit Commissions Revenues for $5,000. Without this accrual entry as of December 31, Sales Rep Company's December financial statements will have the following problems:

Its December income statement will report $0 in revenues that were earned from representing New Corp during December
Its January income statement will report $5,000 in revenues that were actually earned in December when Sales Rep Company was incurring expenses in order to make the sales calls
Its December 31 balance sheet will not be reporting the receivable of $5,000 that it has a right to receive for its December's efforts

Since accrual adjusting entries will be followed by the actual transactions (checks written, billing invoices issued, etc.), a helpful accounting procedure is to record reversing entries on the first day of the next accounting period.",what
Where is a contract with a customer reported on the balance sheet?,"A contract to perform future services for a customer is not reported on the balance sheet of the company that will be providing the services.  For example, if Company Jay and one of its customers sign a contract in December agreeing that Company Jay will deliver $20,000 of services beginning in January, the contract is not reported on Company Jay's December 31 balance sheet. (If the customer makes a deposit of $3,000 at the time of signing the contract, the $3,000 will be recorded by Company Jay in December with a $3,000 debit to Cash and a $3,000 credit to the liability account Customer Deposits or Unearned Revenues. With no downpayment or advance payment in December, there is no entry recorded.)
The $20,000 contract is not reported as an asset on Company Jay's December 31 balance sheet. The reason is that Company Jay has not earned any of the contract amount and therefore does not have a right or a receivable to the $20,000 as of December 31. Similarly, Company Jay's income statement for December and its December 31 owner's equity cannot include any earnings associated with the contract.",what
How should the cost of a yearly subscription for a newspaper be recorded?,"In theory, the payment in advance for a one-year subscription should initially be recorded as a debit to Prepaid Expenses and a credit to Cash. During the subscription period, you would debit Subscription Expense and would credit Prepaid Expenses. 
For example, if the annual subscription cost is $240 and it is paid in advance, you would initially debit Prepaid Expenses for $240 and credit Cash for $240. If your company issues monthly financial statements, then each month during the subscription period you would debit Subscription Expense for $20 and credit Prepaid Expenses for $20. This results in 1) the matching of $20 to expense on each of the monthly income statements, and 2) the balance sheet reporting the amount that is prepaid or not yet expired.
At a large company, the annual cost of $240 will usually be an immaterial amount. The materiality concept will allow you to violate the matching principle, and to avoid the monthly adjusting entry, by simply debiting Subscription Expense for the entire $240 at the beginning of the one-year subscription period.",what
What if a company's Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is understated?,"When a company's Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is understated, the credit balance in this account is too small. This indicates that the company has reported too little of Bad Debts Expense and therefore too much net income.
Having a credit balance in the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts that is too small also means that the company is reporting too much for the following balance sheet items: net receivables, total current assets, working capital, total assets, and owner's equity.",what
Why are some expenses deferred?,"Generally, expenses are deferred in order to comply with the accounting guideline known as the matching principle.
To illustrate the concept, let's assume that a company pays $3,000 on December 30 to rent a warehouse for the upcoming three-month period of January 1 through March 31. Since none of the $3,000 expires or is used up in December, none of the amount should be reported as rent expense on the income statement for the month of December. Hence the $3,000 is deferred to a balance sheet account such as Prepaid Rent (or Prepaid Expenses), which is a current asset account.
During the three months of January 1 through March 31 (when the prepaid rent is expiring) the $3,000 prepayment must be moved from the balance sheet asset account to an income statement expense account. The usual allocation will involve an adjusting entry to debit Rent Expense for $1,000 and credit Prepaid Rent for $1,000 on January 31, February 28 and March 31.",what
What are the various types of adjusting entries?,"Types of Adjusting Entries
Adjusting entries, which are required in order to have a company's financial statements comply with the accrual method of accounting, are often categorized into three types:

Accruals
Deferrals
Other

Accruals
Accruals or accrual adjusting entries are prepared at the end of an accounting period to report amounts that have occurred in the current accounting period but were not yet entered into the general ledger accounts. An example is a retail store's emergency plumbing repair on December 31, the last day of its accounting period. The repair occurred in the December accounting period but the bill will not be received until the January accounting period. As of December 31, the retailer needs an accrual adjusting entry so that its December financial statements will report the expense and the liability. Also on December 31, the plumbing company will need an accrual adjusting entry so that its financial statements will report the revenues and the receivables that were earned in December.
Deferrals
Deferrals or deferral adjusting entries are prepared at the end of an accounting period to defer expenses and/or revenues that have already been recorded in the general ledger accounts. The reason is that some of the recorded amounts will actually be used up and/or earned in a future accounting period. An example is a retailer's payment of $1,200 for six months of property insurance that was paid in advance. For instance, if the payment was made on December 1 for protection during the upcoming period of December 1 through May 31, the retailer's December's income statement should report Insurance Expense of $200 (the expired 1/6 of the $1,200) and the December 31 balance sheet should report Prepaid Insurance of $1,000 (a current asset that represents the unexpired 5/6 of $1,200). The amount used in the deferral adjusting entry should be whatever is necessary to get the proper amounts to appear on the financial statements. The insurance company must also make a deferral adjusting entry so that its December revenues will include only the $200 that was earned. Its December 31 balance sheet should show the unearned $1,000 as the current liability Deferred Premiums.
Other
Other adjusting entries will likely include:

Depreciation of assets used in a business. This is done with a debit to Depreciation Expense and a credit to Accumulated Depreciation.
Reporting bad debts expense pertaining to accounts receivable. This is done by either debiting Bad Debts Expense and crediting Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, or by writing off an account with a debit to Bad Debts Expense and crediting Accounts Receivable.",what
Is a manufacturer's product warranty part of its manufacturing overhead or is it part of its SG&A expense?,"The costs associated with a manufacturer's product warranty are part of its selling expenses and therefore part of its SG&A expenses.
If the future costs of the warranty coverage are probable and can be estimated, they are recorded at the time of the sale. The accounting entry will debit Warranty Expense and will credit Warranty Liability. If the estimated warranty costs are recorded at  the time of the sale, the actual costs of the repair work or the replacement of the product during the warranty period will be debited to the Warranty Liability account—thereby reducing the liability balance.",what
What is a deferred asset?,"A deferred asset represents costs that have occurred, but because of certain circumstances the costs can be reported as expenses at a later time. One of these circumstances is the assurance from an electric utility's regulators that the costs being deferred will be recoverable through increases in future utility rates.
To illustrate, let's assume that an electric utility spent $300,000 for a project before it had to be abandoned. The state regulators ruled that the utility may recover the $300,000 from its customers in the form of higher rates over a 5-year period starting next year. Because of this assurance, the utility can record the $300,000 as a deferred asset. In each of the five subsequent years, the utility will credit the deferred asset account for $60,000 and will debit an expense for $60,000. Hence, the $60,000 of increased expenses will be matched with the $60,000 of increased revenues on five annual income statements.
Deferred assets are also referred to as deferred charges, deferred costs, or deferred debits. For the example we used above, utilities will use the term regulatory assets.
The balance in a deferred asset account will be reported on the balance sheet as a current asset and/or as a noncurrent asset depending on the facts involved.",what
"If a mortgage payment is due by December 31, but the payment is not made until the following month, should the loan payment be accrued at December 31?","The interest portion of the mortgage payment should be accrued as of December 31 under the accrual method of accounting. In other words, there needs to be an adjusting entry dated December 31 to debit Interest Expense and to credit Interest payable for the amount of interest owed as of December 31.
The principal balance on the mortgage loan already appears in the general ledger and on the balance sheet as the liability Mortgage Loan Payable. Therefore, there is no accrual needed for the principal portion of the loan payment due at December 31.",what

How does the aging of accounts receivable determine bad debts expense?,"The aging of accounts receivable allows you to quickly identify the credit customers that are past due and the length of time that the amounts have been past due. Focusing on the past due accounts receivable will assist you in estimating how much of the accounts receivable will never be collected.
The estimated amount of accounts receivable that will never be collected should be the credit balance in the general ledger account  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. This credit balance when combined with the debit balance in Accounts Receivable will mean that the amount that is likely to be collected will be reported on the balance sheet.
When the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is credited to increase its balance, the entry will debit the general ledger account Bad Debts Expense.",what
What if an employee's actual vacation payment is greater than the amount that has been accrued?,"Let's assume that a company's accounting year ends on December 31 and the company has only one employee who worked the full year. The company's handbook specifies that the employee earns 10 hours of vacation for each month worked. However, the vacation hours for the year accumulate. The total vacation hours earned as of December 31 will be paid to the employee on June 1 of the following year by using the employee's June 1 pay rate.
Next, let's assume that each month the company records an accrual adjusting entry that debits Vacation Expense for $200 (10 hours X $20 per hour) and credits Vacation Liability for $200. As a result, the balance in the balance sheet account Vacation Liability at December 31 is $2,400 (12 months X $200, or 120 hours X $20).
On the following June 1, the employee's pay rate is $20.50 which means the employee's gross vacation pay will be $2,460 (120 hours X $20.50). The June 1 journal entry to record the vacation payment is:

Debit Vacation Payable $2,400 (to eliminate the December 31 liability)
Debit Vacation Expense $60
Credit Cash, Payroll Withholdings, etc. for a total of $2,460

Note that the $60 difference was recorded as Vacation Expense in the year of the payment. The financial statements of the prior year were not restated for the $5 monthly differences. The reason is the prior year's monthly amounts were estimates (not mistakes) and the difference is immaterial.",what
"If a mortgage payment is due on January 1, should the payment be accrued at December 31?","The following answer assumes that the accrual basis of accounting (also known as the accrual method of accounting) is being used...
If the interest portion of the January 1 loan payment is for the month of December, then the interest portion should be accrued as of December 31.
To illustrate, let's assume that the amount of the mortgage loan payment due on January 1 is $1,000 and it consists of $300 of interest from December 1 through 31, and a principal payment of $700.
Since the $300 of interest has occurred during December and since the company has an obligation as of December 31 to the lender for that interest, the company must accrue the interest. This is accomplished with an adjusting entry dated December 31 in which Interest Expense is debited for $300 and Interest Payable is credited for $300.
There is no accrual for the principal portion of the loan payment. The principal balance of the loan is not reduced until the actual principal payment occurs.",what
"Why can a retailer record its purchase of merchandise as a debit to purchases within the cost of goods sold, instead of the asset inventory?","Before we explain why companies will record the purchases of merchandise in the Purchases account instead of the Inventory account, let's agree that the objective of the accounting process is to have accurate financial statements. In this case we want an income statement which reports an accurate amount of cost of goods sold, and the resulting gross profit and net income. We need the balance sheet to report an accurate cost of inventory, and the resulting amount of current assets, working capital, total assets, and stockholders' equity. I believe this objective will require some type of an adjustment to the the Inventory account balance and to the cost of goods sold regardless of how the purchases of merchandise were initially recorded.
Now for the reason companies often record purchases in a purchases account. Generally, companies will have a relatively stable amount of inventory and the cost of its annual purchases will be many times the cost of its inventory. This means that most of the cost of its purchases will appear as the cost of goods sold on its income statement. For the minor change in the cost of inventory from the beginning to the end of the accounting period, an adjustment can be made. For example, let's assume that the cost of purchases during the year amounted to $560,000. Let's also assume that the inventory at the end of the year has a cost of $70,000 compared to the inventory cost of $67,000 at the end of the previous accounting year. An adjustment will be entered to debit the Inventory account for $3,000 which will increase the Inventory account balance from $67,000 to $70,000. The credit portion of the entry of $3,000 will cause the cost of goods sold to be reported as $557,000 ($560,000 of debits in the Purchases account during the year minus the amount that increased the cost of inventory: $3,000). After this adjustment, the balance sheet will report the true cost of the ending inventory of $70,000 and the income statement will report the true cost of goods sold of $557,000.",what
Will the adjusting entry amounts appear in the balance sheet and income statement?,"Absolutely. The adjusting entry amounts must be included on the income statement in order to report all revenues earned and all expenses incurred during the accounting period indicated on the income statement. The adjusting entry amounts must also be included in the amounts reported on the balance sheet as of the end of the accounting period.
In the following accounting period, the accrual-type adjusting entries will usually be reversed. They are reversed or removed because the actual invoices or other documents containing the accrued revenues or expenses will be arriving and will be entered into the accounting records by the bookkeeper or the accounts payable clerk.",what
Our income statement shows wide fluctuations in utilities expense from month to month. I suspect our accounting is not proper. Any suggestions?,"Under accrual accounting, your income statement should report the amount for the utilities used during the period of the income statement. The utility bills tell you the cost of the gas and electricity used between the meter reading dates appearing on the utility bill. For example, if the meters are read on the last day of the month then the utility bills received in early July will tell you the cost of the utilities used during the month of June. It is this cost that your company should report as expense on its June income statement. The amount of the utility bills with meter reading dates of June 30 should be reported as a current liability (accounts payable) as of June 30.
When the utility bills are based on monthly meter readings other than on the last day of the month, it gets a bit more complicated. For example, if the meters are read on the 20th day of each month, then the utility bill received at the end of June will show the cost of the utilities used between May 21 and June 20. The amount of this bill is also the liability amount as of June 20th. Since the balance sheet is dated June 30th (and the income statement is for the entire month of June), an adjusting entry should be made to record the additional liability for the utilities used from June 20 through June 30.
To have the correct amount on the income statement, you need to report the expense for the 30 or 31 days during the calendar month that the utilities were used. To have the correct liability amount reported on the balance sheet, you need to report the cost of the utilities used through the last day of the month that have not yet been paid. The reason for this complexity is that the utility provides the electricity and gas each day, but it reads the meters only on one day per month. As a result you will always owe the utility some amount, even if you have paid the most recent utility bill. In short you will need to make an adjusting entry to get the financial statements accurate under accrual accounting.
You raised an important point. You should discuss this further with your accountant.",what
What does it mean to recognize an expense?,"Definition of Recognize an Expense
To recognize an expense means to report the proper amount of an expense on the income statement for the appropriate accounting period.
When and How to Recognize an Expense

When there is a cause-and-effect relationship between a company's revenues and some of its expenses, these expenses should appear on the same income statement as the associated revenues. Accountants describe this as matching expenses with revenues. For instance, a company's sales of products which are properly reported on its July income statement will cause the related expense known as the cost of goods sold to be reported/recognized on the July income statement. If the company's sales reps have earned commissions on the July sales, these commissions should also be recognized/reported as Commissions Expense on the company's July income statement (regardless of when the company pays the commissions).
If a cause-and-effect relationship does not exist between a company's revenues and its costs, and there is no future economic benefit which can be measured, the costs should be recognized/reported immediately as expenses on the current income statement. A few examples include advertising, office salaries, interest on most loans, and research and development costs.
When a cost has a future economic benefit which can be measured, the accountant should report the cost as an asset. Then as the future benefit expires (is used up) the cost should be systematically recognized/reported as an expense on the appropriate income statements. Some examples include the expensing of prepaid insurance premiums and the depreciation of assets used in the company's business.

Use of Adjusting Entries
Companies use adjusting entries in order for their income statements and balance sheets to be reporting the proper amounts in the appropriate accounting periods under the accrual method of accounting.",what
What are generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)?,"Definition of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
Generally accepted accounting principles (commonly referred to as GAAP or US GAAP) are the common accounting rules that must be followed when a U.S. company prepares financial statements that will be distributed to people outside of the company. 
These common rules range from basic underlying principles and assumptions to the detailed rules established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) for complex financial transactions. The FASB has organized the generally accepted accounting principles in its Accounting Standards Codification (ASC).
Why Generally Accepted Accounting Principles are Required?
Generally accepted accounting principles are required so a knowledgeable reader of financial statements is able to do the following:

Compare a company's current financial statements to the earlier financial statements of the same company
Compare a company's financial statements to those of other companies (especially within the same industry)
Understand how a company recognizes/reports revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, etc.

Examples of the Basic Underlying Accounting Principles
The basic underlying accounting principles consist of the following:

Economic entity assumption
Going concern assumption
Time period assumption
Monetary unit assumption
Cost principle or measurement principle
Matching principle or expense recognition principle
Revenue recognition principle
Full disclosure principle
Industry practices

Related to these underlying accounting principles are the following: objectivity, conservatism, materiality, cost/benefit, comparability, consistency, relevance, and timeliness.",what
Are estimates allowed in bookkeeping?,"While bookkeeping involves mostly precise amounts from sales and purchase invoices, cash receipts and checks written, etc. there are situations when estimates need to be entered. This is especially true when monthly financial statements are prepared under the accrual method of accounting. For instance, the monthly bookkeeping entries for depreciation, property taxes, utilities, fringe benefits and more will need to be estimates.
Even the end-of-year financial statements will require some estimated amounts. For example, a company's liability for warranties on its products and its allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable will need to be estimates. Providing an estimated amount is better than ignoring reality and reporting a zero amount.
I recommend that the company's accountant review the estimated amounts that will be entered in the bookkeeping or accounting system.",what
"If an accrual adjusting entry increases an expense and a liability, how does the balance sheet remain in balance?",An expense is a temporary account which reduces owner's equity or stockholders' equity. The decrease in owner's equity will offset the increase in the liability account.,what
Reducing the Need for Accruing Expenses,"One day I was explaining to the owner of a small business that I would have to accrue for the shipping expenses associated with his company's sales. Since the shipping company billed him on the 15th of each month for his shipments from the 16th of the previous month until the 15th of the current month, we needed to estimate the expense for the second half of the month. For example, when I was preparing his company's November 30th balance sheet and its November income statement, we didn't have the shipping expense for November 16 – 30. (He also let me know that during this 15-day period, the shipping expense would be higher than any other 15-day period due to holiday sales.)
He listened carefully as I explained the matching principle, accrual-type adjusting entries, and reversing entries. As soon as I had finished, he phoned the shipping company and asked that his billing period be changed to cover the calendar month. They were pleased to make the change.
Next, the owner called his bank and asked if the bank would be able to deduct the current month's loan interest from the company's checking account on the last day of each month. The bank was pleased to arrange for this procedure.
In less than 15 minutes, the owner eliminated the need for me to calculate/estimate the amounts for two adjusting entries every month. Soon, each month's actual amounts would be arriving automatically.",what
"Why are wages reported as an expense when the work occurs, but the employees' tax records report them when they are paid?","Accrual Method for the Corporation, Cash Method for the Employees
The short answer is that the corporation's financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting (generally accepted accounting principles), while the employee payroll records for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires the cash method of accounting.
Example of the Corporation's Wages Expense (Based on Work Dates)
To illustrate, let's assume that a new retailer (that uses the accrual method of accounting) begins operations on December 27. The employees working from December 27 through December 31 will receive their first paychecks on January 4. If the employees earn a total of $5,000 of wages during the five days ending on December 31, the retailer's general ledger and financial statements for the period ending December 31 must report wages expense of $5,000 and a liability of $5,000 as of December 31. In accounting jargon, the retailer must accrue the expense and liability through an adjusting entry dated December 31.
Example of the Employees' Earnings Reported to IRS (Based on Pay Dates)
The retailer's payroll department must report to the IRS the wages paid. Therefore, the amount reported to the IRS is based on the pay dates. Since January 4 is the first time the employees will be paid, the employees' wages earned during December 27-31 will be reported to the IRS as January wages.",what
What is the difference between accounts payable and accounts receivable?,"Definition of Accounts Payable
Accounts payable is a current liability account in which a company records the amounts it owes to suppliers or vendors for goods or services that it received on credit.
Definition of Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable is a current asset account in which a company records the amounts it has a right to collect from customers who received goods or services on credit.
Examples of Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable
Let's assume that Company A sells merchandise to Company B on credit (with payment due 30 days later). Company A will record the amount of the sale with a credit to Sales and a debit to Accounts Receivable. Company B will record the purchase (perhaps as inventory) with a credit to Accounts Payable.
When the amount of the credit sale is remitted, Company B will debit its liability Accounts Payable and will credit Cash. Company A will debit Cash and will credit its current asset Accounts Receivable.
Symmetry with Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable
Our examples show that there are two sides to every transaction (which some people refer to as symmetry).
At the time of the sale:

Company A reported a sale and a current asset, and
Company B reported a purchase and a current liability

At the time of payment:

Company A's Cash increased and its Accounts Receivable decreased
Company B's Cash decreased and its Accounts Payable decreased

Balance Sheet: Retail/Wholesale - Corporation",what
How do I calculate the amount of sales tax that is included in total receipts?,"Sales Tax Calculation
To calculate the sales tax that is included in a company's receipts, divide the total amount received (for the items that are subject to sales tax) by ""1 + the sales tax rate"". In other words, if the sales tax rate is 6%, divide the sales taxable receipts by 1.06. If the sales tax rate is 7.25%, divide the sales taxable receipts by 1.0725.
Example of the Sales Tax Calculation
As an example, assume that all of the items in a vending machine are subject to a sales tax of 7%. In the most recent month the vending machine receipts were $481.50. Hence, $481.50 includes the amounts received for the sales of products and the sales tax on these products. The use of algebra allows us to calculate how much of the $481.50 is the true sales amount and how much is the sales tax on those products:
Let S = the true sales of products (excluding the sales tax), and let 0.07S = the sales tax on the true sales. Since the true sales + the sales tax = $481.50, we can state this as S + 0.07S = 1.07S = $481.50. We solve for S by dividing $481.50 by 1.07. The result is that the true product sales amounted to $450. The 7% of sales tax on the true sales is $31.50 ($450 X 0.07). Now let's make sure this adds up: $450 of sales of product + $31.50 of sales tax = $481.50, which was the total amount of the vending machine receipts.
Additional Example of the Sales Tax Calculation
Now let's assume that total amount of a company's receipts including a 7% sales tax is $32,100. The true sales will be S, and the sales tax will be 0.07S. Therefore, S + 0.07S = 1.07S = $32,100. The true sales, S, will be $30,000 ($32,100 divided by 1.07). The sales tax on the true sales will be 0.07 X $30,000 = $2,100. Our proof is $30,000 of sales + $2,100 of sales tax = $32,100. In general journal form the accounting entry to record this information is: debit Cash $32,100; credit Sales $30,000; credit Sales Tax Payable $2,100.",what
What is the distinction between debtor and creditor?,"Definition of Debtor
A debtor is a person or enterprise that owes money to another party. The party to whom the money is owed might be a supplier, bank, or other lender who is referred to as the creditor.
Definition of Creditor
A creditor is a person, bank, or other enterprise that has lent money or extended credit to another party. The party to whom the credit has been granted is the debtor.
Examples of a Debtor and a Creditor
Assume that a company borrows money from its bank. The company is the debtor and the bank is the creditor. If a manufacturer sells merchandise to a retailer with terms of net 30 days, the manufacturer is the creditor and retailer is the debtor.",what
What is owner's equity?,"Definition of Owner's Equity
Owner's equity is one of the three main sections of a sole proprietorship's balance sheet and one of the components of the accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity. 
Owner's equity represents the owner's investment in the business minus the owner's draws or withdrawals from the business plus the net income (or minus the net loss) since the business began.
Owner's equity is viewed as a residual claim on the business assets because liabilities have a higher claim. Owner's equity can also be viewed (along with liabilities) as a source of the business assets.
Example of Owner's Equity
If a sole proprietorship's accounting records indicate assets of $100,000 and liabilities of $70,000, the amount of owner's equity is $30,000.
Due to the cost principle (and other accounting principles) the amount of owner's equity should not be considered to be the fair market value of the business.",what
What is a capital expenditure versus a revenue expenditure?,"Definition of Capital Expenditure
A capital expenditure is an amount spent to acquire or significantly improve the capacity or capabilities of a long-term asset such as equipment or buildings. Usually the cost is recorded in a balance sheet account that is reported under the heading of Property, Plant and Equipment. The asset's cost (except for the cost of land) will then be allocated to depreciation expense over the useful life of the asset. The amount of each period's depreciation expense is also credited to the contra-asset account Accumulated Depreciation.
Examples of Capital Expenditures
Examples of capital expenditures include the amounts spent to acquire or significantly improve assets such as land, buildings, equipment, furnishings, fixtures, vehicles. The total amount spent on capital expenditures during an accounting year is reported under investment activities on the statement of cash flows.
Definition of Revenue Expenditure
A revenue expenditure is an amount that is spent for an expense that will be matched immediately with the revenues reported on the current period's income statement.
Examples of Revenue Expenditures
Examples of revenue expenditures include the amounts spent on repairs and maintenance, selling, general and administrative expenses.",what
What is the difference between the cash basis and the accrual basis of accounting?,"Definition of the Cash Basis of Accounting

Revenues are reported on the income statement in the period in which the cash is received from customers.
Expenses are reported on the income statement when the cash is paid out.

Definition of the Accrual Basis of Accounting
The accrual basis of accounting provides a better picture of a company's profits during an accounting period for the following reasons:

Revenues are reported on the income statement when they are earned, which often occurs before the cash is received from the customers.
Expenses are reported on the income statement in the period when they match up with the related revenues, occur, or expire, which is often in a period different from the period when the payment is made.

The accrual basis of accounting also provides a better picture of a company's financial position at the end of the accounting year. The reason is that all assets that were earned are reported and all liabilities that were incurred will be reported on the balance sheet.
The accrual basis of accounting is required because of the matching principle.",what
What is the double declining balance method of depreciation?,"Definition of Double Declining Balance Method of Depreciation
The double declining balance method of depreciation, also known as the 200% declining balance method of depreciation, is a form of accelerated depreciation. This means that compared to the straight-line method, the depreciation expense will be faster in the early years of the asset's life but slower in the later years. However, the total amount of depreciation expense during the life of the assets will be the same. 
The ""double"" means 200% of the straight line rate of depreciation, while the ""declining balance"" refers to the asset's book value or carrying value at the beginning of the accounting period. Since book value is an asset's cost minus its accumulated depreciation, the asset's book value will be decreasing when the contra asset account Accumulated Depreciation is credited with the depreciation expense of the accounting period.
Example of Double Declining Balance Depreciation
Let's assume that a retailer purchases fixtures on January 1 at a cost of $100,000. It is expected that the fixtures will have no salvage value at the end of their useful life of 10 years. Under the straight-line method, the 10-year life means the asset's annual depreciation will be 10% of the asset's cost. Under the double declining balance method the 10% straight line rate is doubled to 20%. However, the 20% is multiplied times the fixture's book value at the beginning of the year instead of the fixture's original cost.
At the beginning of the first year, the fixture's book value is $100,000 since the fixtures have not yet had any depreciation. Therefore, under the double declining balance method the $100,000 of book value will be multiplied by 20% and will result in $20,000 of depreciation for Year 1. The journal entry will be a debit of $20,000 to Depreciation Expense and a credit of $20,000 to Accumulated Depreciation.
At the beginning of the second year, the fixture's book value will be $80,000, which is the cost of $100,000 minus the accumulated depreciation of $20,000. When the $80,000 is multiplied by 20% the result is $16,000 of depreciation for Year 2.
At the beginning of Year 3, the asset's book value will be $64,000. This is the fixture's cost of $100,000 minus its accumulated depreciation of $36,000 ($20,000 + $16,000). The book value of $64,000 multiplied by 20% is $12,800 of depreciation expense for Year 3.
At the beginning of Year 4, the asset's book value will be $51,200. Therefore, the book value of $51,200 multiplied by 20% will result in $10,240 of depreciation expense for Year 4.
At the beginning of Year 5, the asset's book value will be $40,960. This is the amount to be depreciated over the remaining 6 years. In year 5, companies often switch to straight-line depreciation and debit Depreciation Expense and credit Accumulated Depreciation for $6,827 ($40,960/6 years) in each of the six remaining years.",what
What is a contingent liability?,"Definition of Contingent Liability
A contingent liability is a potential liability that may or may not become an actual liability. Whether the contingent liability becomes an actual liability depends on a future event occurring or not occurring.
In accounting, some contingent liabilities and their related contingent losses are:

Recorded with a journal entry
Are limited to a disclosure in the notes to the financial statements
Not recorded or disclosed

We have another Q&A that discusses the recording of contingent liabilities.

A company's supplier is unable to obtain a bank loan. The company agrees to guarantee that the supplier's bank loan will be repaid. As a result of the company's guarantee, the bank makes the loan to the supplier. The company has a contingent liability. If the supplier makes the loan payments needed to pay off the loan, the company will have no liability. If the supplier fails to repay the bank, the company will have an actual liability.
If a company is sued by a former employee for $500,000 for age discrimination, the company has a contingent liability. If the company is found guilty, it will have an actual liability. However, if the company is not found guilty, the company will not have any liability.
A product warranty is also a contingent liability.",what
What are accrued expenses and when are they recorded?,"Accrued Expenses
Accrued expenses are expenses that have occurred but are not yet recorded in the company's general ledger. This means these expenses will not appear on the financial statements unless an adjusting entry is entered prior to issuing the financial statements.
Example of an Accrued Expense
To illustrate an accrued expense, let's assume that a company borrowed $200,000 on December 1. The agreement requires that the company repay the $200,000 on February 28 along with $6,000 of interest for the three months of December through February. As of December 31, the company will not have an invoice to process and will not be paying the interest until it is due on February 28.
Recording an Accrued Expense
Without an adjusting entry to accrue the interest expense that was incurred by the company in December, the company's financial statements as of December 31 will not be reporting the $2,000 of interest (one-third of the $6,000) that the company has incurred in December. In order for the financial statements to be correct on the accrual basis of accounting, the accountant must record an adjusting entry dated as of December 31. The adjusting entry will consist of a debit of $2,000 to Interest Expense (an income statement account) and a credit of $2,000 to Interest Payable (a balance sheet account).

What is equity?,"Definitions and Examples of Equity
Equity has several definitions that pertain to accounting:



Equity can indicate an ownership interest in a business, such as stockholders' equity or owner's equity.
Equity can mean the combination of liabilities and owner's equity. For example, the basic accounting equation Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity can be restated to be Assets = Equities.
Equity can mean an owner's interest in a personal asset. For example, the owner of a $200,000 house that has a mortgage loan of $75,000 is said to have $125,000 of equity in the house.

What is financial leverage?,"Definition of Financial Leverage
Financial leverage which is also known as leverage or trading on equity, refers to the use of debt to acquire additional assets.
The use of financial leverage to control a greater amount of assets (by borrowing money) will cause the returns on the owner's cash investment to be amplified. That is, with financial leverage:

an increase in the value of the assets will result in a larger gain on the owner's cash, when the loan interest rate is less than the rate of increase in the asset's value
a decrease in the value of the assets will result in a larger loss on the owner's cash

Examples of Financial Leverage
Mary uses $500,000 of her cash to purchase 40 acres of land with a total cost of $500,000. Mary is not using financial leverage.
Sue uses $500,000 of her cash and borrows $1,000,000 to purchase 120 acres of land having a total cost of $1,500,000. Sue is using financial leverage to own/control $1,500,000 of property with only $500,000 of her own money. Let's also assume that the interest on Sue's loan is $50,000 per year and it is paid at the beginning of each year.
Effects of Using Financial Leverage
For our examples let's assume that after one year, the land owned by Mary and the land owned by Sue increased in value by 20% and both Mary and Sue sold their land investments at the market values. As a result:

Mary's land will sell for $600,000 which results in a gain of $100,000 (selling price of $600,000 minus the land's cost of $500,000). The $100,000 gain on Mary's cash of $500,000 results in a gain of 20% on Mary's $100,000 
Sue's land will sell for $1,800,000 which results in a gain of $250,000 (selling price of $1,800,000 minus $1,550,000, which is the land's cost of $1,500,000 and interest of $50,000). The $250,000 gain on Sue's $550,000 of cash is a gain of 45% instead of a gain of 20% without the use of leverage

Now let's assume that after one year, the land owned by Mary and and the land owned by Sue decreased in value by 20% and that both Mary and Sue sold their land investments at the market values. As a result:

Mary's land will sell for $400,000 which means a $100,000 loss on the land's cost of $500,000. The $100,000 loss on Mary's cash of $500,000 results in a 20% loss on Mary's money
Sue's land will sell for $1,200,000 which results in a loss of $350,000 (selling price of $1,200,000 minus the land's cost of $1,500,000 and interest of $50,000). The $350,000 loss on Sue's cash of $550,000 results in a 63.6% loss on Sue's money instead of a loss of 20% without the use of leverage",what
Which assets are classified as current assets?,"Definition of Current Assets
Current assets include cash and assets that are expected to turn to cash within one year of the balance sheet date. Current assets also include prepaid expenses that will be used up within one year. If a company's operating cycle is longer than one year, the length of the operating cycle is used in place of the one-year time period.
Examples of Current Assets
Assets that are reported as current assets on a company's balance sheet include:

Cash, which includes checking account balances, currency, and undeposited checks from customers (if the checks are not postdated)
Petty cash
Cash equivalents, such as U.S. Treasury Bills which were purchased within 90 days of their maturity
Temporary investments, such as certificates of deposit maturing within one year of the balance sheet date, and certain readily marketable securities
Accounts receivable, or trade receivables, after deducting an allowance for doubtful accounts
Notes receivable maturing within one year of the balance sheet date
Other receivables, such as income tax refunds, cash advances to employees, and insurance claims
Inventory of raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods, manufacturing and packaging supplies
Office supplies
Prepaid expenses, such as insurance premiums which have not yet expired
Advance payments on future purchases",what
What is the debt to total assets ratio?,"Definition of Debt to Total Assets Ratio
The debt to total assets ratio is an indicator of a company's financial leverage. It tells you the percentage of a company's total assets that were financed by creditors. In other words, it is the total amount of a company's liabilities divided by the total amount of the company's assets.
Note: Debt includes more than loans and bonds payable. Debt is the total amount of all liabilities (current liabilities and long-term liabilities).
Example of Debt to Total Assets Ratio
Let's assume that a corporation has $100 million in total assets, $40 million in total liabilities, and $60 million in stockholders' equity. This corporation's debt to total assets ratio is 0.4 ($40 million of liabilities divided by $100 million of assets), 0.4 to 1, or 40%. This indicates 40% of the corporation's assets are being financed by the creditors, and the owners are providing 60% of the assets' cost. Generally, the higher the debt to total assets ratio, the greater the financial leverage and the greater the risk.
How To Be Used
As with all financial ratios, it is best for a company to compare its debt to total assets ratio to:

its ratio at an earlier date
its targeted ratio...its goal
the ratios at companies in the same industry",what
What is the difference between vertical analysis and horizontal analysis?,"Definition of Vertical Analysis
Vertical analysis expresses each amount on a financial statement as a percentage of another amount.

The vertical analysis of a balance sheet results in every balance sheet amount being restated as a percent of total assets.
The vertical analysis of an income statement results in every income statement amount being restated as a percent of net sales.

Example of Vertical Analysis of a Balance Sheet
If a company's inventory is $100,000 and its total assets are $400,000 the inventory will be expressed as 25% ($100,000 divided by $400,000). If cash is $8,000 then it will be presented as 2%($8,000 divided by $400,000). The total of the assets' percentages will add up to 100%. If the accounts payable are $88,000 they will be restated as 22% ($88,000 divided by $400,000). If owner's equity is $240,000 it will be shown as 60% ($240,000 divided by $400,000). The sum of the liabilities and owner's equity will also be 100%. The vertical analysis of the balance sheet will result in a common-size balance sheet. The percentages on a common-size balance sheet allow you to compare a small company's balance sheets to that of a very large company's balance sheet. A common-size balance sheet can also be compared to the average percentages for the industry.
Example of Vertical Analysis of an Income Statement
If a company's net sales were $1,000,000 they will be presented as 100% ($1,000,000 divided by $1,000,000). If the cost of goods sold amount is $780,000 it will be presented as 78% ($780,000 divided by sales of $1,000,000). If interest expense is $50,000 it will be presented as 5% ($50,000 divided by $1,000,000). The restated amounts result in a common-size income statement, since it can be compared to the income statement of a competitor of any size or to the industry's percentages.
Definition of Horizontal Analysis
Horizontal analysis looks at amounts from the financial statements over a horizon of many years. Horizontal analysis is also referred to as trend analysis. The amounts from past financial statements will be restated to be a percentage of the amounts from a base year. 
Examples of Horizontal Analysis
To illustrate horizontal analysis, let's assume that a base year is five years earlier. All of the amounts on the balance sheets and the income statements will be expressed as a percentage of the base year amounts. The amounts from five years earlier are presented as 100% or simply 100. The amounts from the most recent years will be divided by the base year amounts. For instance, if a most recent year amount was three times as large as the base year, the most recent year will be presented as 300. If the previous year's amount was twice the amount of the base year, it will be presented as 200. Seeing the horizontal analysis of every item allows you to more easily see the trends. It will be easy to detect that over the years the cost of goods sold has been increasing at a faster pace than the company's net sales. From the balance sheet's horizontal analysis you may see that inventory and accounts payable have been growing as a percentage of total assets.
Vertical analysis, horizontal analysis and financial ratios are part of financial statement analysis.",what
What is a liability?,"Definition of Liability
A liability is an obligation arising from a past business event. It is reported on a company's balance sheet.
Liabilities are also part of the basic accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders' Equity. Liabilities are often viewed as claims against the company's assets. However, liabilities can also be viewed as sources of the company's assets.
Examples of a Liability
Examples of a liability include:

accounts payable
loans payable
wages payable
interest payable
customer deposits
deferred revenues",what
What is the difference between product costs and period costs?,"A manufacturer's product costs are the direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead used in making its products. (Manufacturing overhead is also referred to as factory overhead, indirect manufacturing costs, and burden.) The product costs of direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead are also ""inventoriable"" costs, since these are the necessary costs of manufacturing the products.
Period costs are not a necessary part of the manufacturing process. As a result, period costs cannot be assigned to the products or to the cost of inventory. The period costs are usually associated with the selling function of the business or its general administration. The period costs are reported as expenses in the accounting period in which they 1) best match with revenues, 2) when they expire, or 3) in the current accounting period. In addition to the selling and general administrative expenses, most interest expense is a period expense.",what
What is a current asset?,"Definition of Current Asset
A current asset is a company's cash and its other assets that are expected to be converted to cash within one year of the date appearing in the heading of the company's balance sheet. However, if a company has an operating cycle that is longer than one year, an asset that is expected to turn to cash within that longer operating cycle will be a current asset.
Current assets are usually presented first on the company's balance sheet and they are arranged in their order of liquidity.
Current assets are also a key component of a company's working capital and the current ratio.
Examples of Current Assets
Examples of current assets and the typical order of liquidity include:

Cash and cash equivalents (which includes currency, checking accounts, petty cash, some U.S. Treasury Bills)
Temporary investments
Accounts receivable
Inventory
Supplies
Prepaid expenses",what
What is included in cash and cash equivalents?,"Examples of Cash
In accounting, a company's cash includes the following:

currency and coins
checks received from customers but not yet deposited
checking accounts
petty cash

Definition of Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments with a maturity date that was 3 months or less at the time of purchase. In other words, there is very little risk of collecting the full amount being reported.
Examples of Cash Equivalents
Examples of cash equivalents include: 

money market accounts
U.S. Treasury Bills
commercial paper

Typically, the combined amount of cash and cash equivalents will be reported on the balance sheet as the first item in the section with the heading current assets.",what
What is accumulated depreciation?,"Definition of Accumulated Depreciation
Accumulated depreciation is the total amount of a plant asset's cost that has been allocated to depreciation expense (or to manufacturing overhead) since the asset was put into service. Accumulated depreciation (and the related depreciation expense) are associated with constructed assets such as buildings, machinery, office equipment, furniture, fixtures, vehicles, etc.
Accumulated Depreciation is also the title of the contra asset account. Accumulated Depreciation is credited when Depreciation Expense is debited each accounting period.
Subtracting accumulated depreciation from an asset's cost results in the asset's book value or carrying value. Hence, the credit balance in the account Accumulated Depreciation cannot exceed the debit balance in the related asset account.
Example of Accumulated Depreciation
Assume that a company purchased a delivery vehicle for $50,000 and determined that the depreciation expense should be $9,000 for 5 years. Each year the account Accumulated Depreciation will be credited for $9,000. Since this is a balance sheet account, its balance keeps accumulating. Therefore, after three years the balance in Accumulated Depreciation will be a credit balance of $27,000 and the vehicle's book value will be $23,000 ($50,000 minus $27,000).
It is important to note that an asset's book value does not indicate the vehicle's market value since depreciation is merely an allocation technique.
If the vehicle is sold, both the vehicle's cost and its accumulated depreciation at the date of the sale will be removed from the accounts. If the amount received is greater than the book value, a gain will be recorded. If the amount received is less than the book value, a loss is recorded.",what
What is meant by reconciling an account?,"Definition of Reconciling an Account
Reconciling an account is likely to mean proving or documenting that an account balance is correct.
Examples of Reconciling an Account
When a company reconciles its bank statement, it is reconciling the balance in its general ledger account Cash (or Cash: Checking Account) with the bank's information.
Prior to issuing a company's financial statements, it is wise to reconcile every balance sheet account by collecting the information that supports the accounts' ending balances. For example, the Accounts Receivable balance could begin by comparing the balance with an aging of the accounts receivable. 
Another example is reconciling the balance in the general ledger account Utilities Payable. This might be accomplished by computing the daily cost of each utility that the company uses. The cost per day is then multiplied by the number of days since the last meter reading date shown on the utility bills that have already been recorded.",what
What is the provision for bad debts?,"Definition of Provision for Bad Debts
The provision for bad debts could refer to the balance sheet account also known as the Allowance for Bad Debts, Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, or Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts. If so, the account Provision for Bad Debts is a contra asset account (an asset account with a credit balance). It is used along with the account Accounts Receivable in order for the balance sheet to report the net realizable value of the company's accounts receivable. The entry to increase the credit balance in these contra accounts is a debit to the income statement account Bad Debts Expense.
Some companies might use the description provision for bad debts on its income statement in order to report the credit losses that pertain to the period of the income statement. In that case, provision for bad debts would be an income statement account. However, the U.S. accounting textbooks are more likely to use Bad Debts Expense or Uncollectible Accounts Expense to describe the amount reported on the income statement.",what
What is the difference between stocks and bonds?,"Definition of Stocks
Stocks, or shares of capital stock, represent an ownership interest in a corporation. Every corporation has common stock. Some corporations issue preferred stock in addition to its common stock. Shares of common stock do not have maturity dates.
Stocks pay dividends, which are a distribution of the corporation's profits to its owners. However, the dividend occurs only if the corporation's board of directors declare the dividend. The dividend payments are not an expense on the corporation's financial statements or on its U.S. income tax return.
Definition of Bonds
Bonds are a form of long-term debt in which the issuing corporation promises to pay the principal amount at a specified maturity date. 
Bonds also promise to pay a fixed interest payment to the bondholders usually every six months until the bonds mature. In the U.S. the interest paid to the bondholders by the corporation is a deductible expense on the corporation's income tax return.
Typically businesses do not issue bonds.",what
Why is depreciation on the income statement different from the depreciation on the balance sheet?,"Definition of Depreciation
Depreciation is the systematic allocation of an asset's cost to expense over the useful life of the asset.
Example of Depreciation
Let's assume that a retailer purchased displays for its store at a cost of $120,000. The displays have a useful life of 10 years and will have no salvage value. The straight-line method of depreciation will result in depreciation of $1,000 per month ($120,000 divided by 120 months). The monthly journal entry to record the depreciation will be a debit of $1,000 to the income statement account Depreciation Expense and a credit of $1,000 to the balance sheet contra asset account Accumulated Depreciation.
Depreciation on the Income Statement
The depreciation reported on the income statement is the amount of depreciation expense that is appropriate for the period of time indicated in the heading of the income statement. 
Using our example, the monthly income statements will report $1,000 of depreciation expense. The quarterly income statements will report $3,000 of depreciation expense, and the annual income statements will report $12,000 of depreciation expense. Each month $1,000 of depreciation expense is being matched to the 120 monthly income statements during which the displays are used to generate sales revenues.
Depreciation on the Balance Sheet
The depreciation reported on the balance sheet is the accumulated or the cumulative total amount of depreciation that has been reported as depreciation expense on the income statement from the time the assets were acquired until the date of the balance sheet.
Using our example, after one month of use the accumulated depreciation for the displays will be $1,000. After 24 months of use, the accumulated depreciation reported on the balance sheet will be $24,000. After 120 months, the accumulated depreciation reported on the balance sheet will be $120,000. At that point, the depreciation will stop since the displays' cost of $120,000 has been fully depreciated. If the displays continue to be used in the 11th year, there will be no depreciation expense in the 11th year and the accumulated depreciation will continue to be $120,000.",what
What is retained earnings?,"Definition of Retained Earnings
Retained earnings is the cumulative amount of earnings since the corporation was formed minus the cumulative amount of dividends that were declared. Retained earnings is the corporation's past earnings that have not been distributed as dividends to its stockholders.
Are Retained Earnings an Asset?
The amount of a corporation's retained earnings is reported as a separate line within the stockholders' equity section of the balance sheet. However, the past earnings that have not been distributed as dividends to the stockholders will likely be reinvested in additional income-producing assets or used to reduce the corporation's liabilities. 
Where do Retained Earnings Come From?
At the end of an accounting year, the balances in a corporation's revenue, gain, expense, and loss accounts are used to compute the year's net income. Those account balances are then transferred to the Retained Earnings account. When the year's revenues and gains exceed the expenses and losses, the corporation will have a positive net income which causes the balance in the Retained Earnings account to increase. (If the corporation's revenues and gains for the year are less than the expenses and losses, the result is a net loss that reduces the normal credit balance in the Retained Earnings account.) The balance in the Retained Earnings account is also decreased when the corporation declares a cash dividend. 
What is the Normal Balance in the Retained Earnings Account?
The normal balance in a profitable corporation's Retained Earnings account is a credit balance. This is logical since the revenue accounts have credit balances and expense accounts have debit balances. If the balance in the Retained Earnings account has a debit balance, this negative amount of retained earnings may be described as deficit or accumulated deficit.",what
What is a contra asset account?,"Definition of Contra Asset Account
A contra asset account is an asset account where the account balance is a credit balance. It is described as ""contra"" because having a credit balance in an asset account is contrary to the normal or expected debit balance. (A debit balance in a contra asset account will violate the cost principle.)
Examples of Contra Asset Accounts
The most common contra asset account is Accumulated Depreciation. Accumulated Depreciation is associated with property, plant and equipment (plant assets). Accumulated Depreciation will be credited when Depreciation Expense is recorded. The credit balance in Accumulated Depreciation means that the cost of the property, plant and equipment will continue to be reported. Looking at the cost of the plant assets and the credit balance in Accumulated Depreciation allows us to see how much of the plant assets' cost has been depreciated and how much has not been depreciated.
Another contra asset account is Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. This account appears next to the current asset Accounts Receivable. The account Allowance for Doubtful Account is credited when the account Bad Debts Expense is debited under the allowance method. The use of Allowance for Doubtful Accounts allows us to see in Accounts Receivable the total amount that the company has a right to collect from its credit customers. The credit balance in the account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts tells us how much of the debit balance in Accounts Receivable is unlikely to be collected.
A less common example of a contra asset account is Discount on Notes Receivable. The credit balance in this account is amortized or allocated to Interest Income or Interest Revenue over the life of a note receivable.",what
What is the difference between Notes Payable and Accounts Payable?,"Definition of Notes Payable
The account Notes Payable is a liability account in which a borrower's written promise to pay a lender is recorded. (The lender record's the borrower's written promise in Notes Receivable.) Generally, the written note specifies the principal amount, the date due, and the interest to be paid.
For most companies, if the note will be due within one year, the borrower will classify the note payable as a current liability. If the note is due after one year, the note payable will be reported as a long-term or noncurrent liability.
Example of a Note Payable
If a company borrows money from its bank, the bank will require the company's officers to sign a formal loan agreement before the bank provides the money. The company will record this loan in its general ledger account, Notes Payable. In addition to the formal promise, some loans require collateral to reduce the bank's risk.
Definition of Account Payable
The account Accounts Payable is normally a current liability used to record purchases on credit from a company's suppliers. In this situation there is no formal written promise to pay.
Examples of Accounts Payable
Often a company will send a purchase order to a supplier requesting goods. When the supplier delivers the goods it also issues a sales invoice stating the amount and the credit terms such as Due in 30 days. After matching the supplier's invoice with its purchase order and receiving records, the company will record the amount owed in Accounts Payable.
Other amounts recorded in Accounts Payable will include invoices/bills that a company owes for services it had received on credit. Examples include legal services, utility bills (electricity, heat, phone), consulting services, etc.",what
What entry is made when selling a fixed asset?,"Defining the Entries When Selling a Fixed Asset
When a fixed asset or plant asset is sold, there are several things that must take place:

The fixed asset's depreciation expense must be recorded up to the date of the sale
The fixed asset's cost and the updated accumulated depreciation must be removed
The cash received must be recorded
The difference between the amounts removed in 2. and the cash received in 3. is recorded as a gain or loss on the sale of the fixed assets

Example of Entries When Selling a Plant Asset
Assume that on January 31, a company sells one of its machines that is no longer used for $3,000. Depreciation was last recorded on December 31. Also assume that the depreciation expense is $400 per month and the general ledger shows the machine's cost was $50,000 and its accumulated depreciation at December 31 was $39,600.
On January 31, the date the machine is sold, the company must record January's depreciation. This entry debits $400 to Depreciation Expense and credits $400 to Accumulated Depreciation.
Also on January 31, the company must debit Cash for $3,000 (the amount received); debit Accumulated Depreciation for $40,000 (the balance after the January 31 entry); debit Loss of Sale of Fixed Assets $7,000; and credit Machines for $50,000.
The $7,000 loss recorded on January 31 is the result of removing the machine's book value of $10,000 (cost of $50,000 minus its accumulated depreciation of $40,000), and replacing it with $3,000 of cash.
If the cash that the company received was greater than the asset's book value, the company would record the difference as a credit to Gain on Sale of Fixed of Assets.",what
What is the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts?,"Definition of Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
The Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is a balance sheet contra asset account that reduces the reported amount of accounts receivable. The use of this allowance account will result in a more realistic picture of the amount of the accounts receivable that will be turning to cash, since some customers may not pay the full amount owed to the company.
The credit balance in the allowance account is an estimate amount in an adjusting entry that debits the income statement account Bad Debts Expense and credits Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. While the allowance account is recommended for the company's financial statements, it is not acceptable for income tax purposes.
Example of the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Let's assume that a company has a debit balance in Accounts Receivable of $120,500 as a result of having sold goods on credit. Through the use of the aging method, the company sees that $18,000 of the receivables are 100 days past due. Upon further checking, the company believes that $10,000 of these receivables will never be collected. Thus, the account Allowance for Doubtful Account must have a credit balance of $10,000. If the present balance is $0, the journal entry will be a debit of $10,000 to Bad Debts Expense and a credit of $10,000 to Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.
The balance sheet will now report Accounts Receivable of $120,500 less the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts of $10,000, for a net amount of $110,500. The income statement for the accounting period will report Bad Debts Expense of $10,000.

What is the accounting journal entry for depreciation?,"Definition of Journal Entry for Depreciation
The journal entry for depreciation is:

Debit to the income statement account Depreciation Expense
Credit to the balance sheet account Accumulated Depreciation

The income statement account Depreciation Expense is a temporary account. Therefore, at the end of each year, its balance is closed and the account Depreciation Expense will begin the next year with a zero balance.
The account Accumulated Depreciation is a balance sheet account and therefore its balance is not closed at the end of the year. Accumulated Depreciation is a contra asset account whose credit balance will get larger every year. However, its credit balance cannot exceed the cost of the asset being depreciated.
Purpose of Journal Entry for Depreciation
The purpose of the journal entry for depreciation is to achieve the matching principle. In each accounting period, part of the cost of certain assets (equipment, building, vehicle, etc.) will be moved from the balance sheet to depreciation expense on the income statement. The goal is to match the cost of the asset to the revenues in the accounting periods in which the asset is being used.
More Information on the Depreciation Entry
It is important to understand the following:

The depreciation entry will cause a decrease in the company's net income, but the company's cash is not decreasing. (Cash was decreased when the asset was acquired.)
The depreciation entry is an estimate based on the asset's historical cost, its estimated useful life, and its estimated salvage value.
The depreciation entry is an allocation of the asset's cost, it is not an attempt to indicate the current market value of the asset.",what
What is the cost principle?,"Definition of Cost Principle
The cost principle is one of the basic underlying guidelines in accounting. It is also known as the historical cost principle. 
The cost principle requires that assets be recorded at the cash amount (or the equivalent) at the time that an asset is acquired. Further, the amount recorded will not be increased for inflation or improvements in market value. (An exception is the change in market value of a short-term investment in the capital stock of a corporation whose shares of stock are actively traded on a major stock exchange.)
Example of Cost Principle
The cost principle means that a long-term asset purchased for the cash amount of $50,000 will be recorded at $50,000. If the same asset was purchased for a down payment of $20,000 and a formal promise to pay $30,000 within a reasonable period of time and with a reasonable interest rate, the asset will also be recorded at $50,000.
A long-term asset that will be used in a business (other than land) will be depreciated based on its cost. The cost will be reported on the balance sheet along with the amount of the asset's accumulated depreciation. Further, the accumulated depreciation cannot exceed the asset's cost. 
The cost principle prohibits a company from recording an asset that was not acquired in a transaction. Hence, a company cannot report its highly successful management team as an asset nor can it report its highly valuable trademark that it developed over many years. (As a result of the cost principle, some of a company's most valuable assets will not appear as assets on the company's balance sheet.) On the other hand, if the company acquires a competitor's trademark in a $3 million transaction, that trademark will be reported as an asset at its cost of $3 million.",what
What is goodwill?,"Definition of Goodwill
In accounting, goodwill is an intangible asset associated with a business combination. Goodwill is recorded when a company acquires (purchases) another company and the purchase price is greater than 1) the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired, minus 2) the liabilities that were assumed.
Goodwill is reported on the balance sheet as a long-term or noncurrent asset. Since 2001, U.S. companies are no longer required to amortize the recorded amount of goodwill. However, the amount of goodwill is subject to a goodwill impairment test at least once per year. (Beginning in 2015, private companies may opt to amortize goodwill generally over a 10-year period and thereby minimize the cost and complexity involved with testing for impairment.)
Outside of accounting, goodwill might be referring to some value that has been built up within a company as a result of delivering amazing customer service, unique management, teamwork, etc. However, this goodwill is unrelated to a business combination and cannot be recorded or reported on the company's balance sheet.
Example of Goodwill
Let's assume that Company A acquires Business X for $5 million based on Business X's annual net income X 10. The fair value of Business X's identifiable assets was $4 million and its liabilities were $1 million. Therefore, Company A is paying $5 million for identifiable assets and liabilities having a value of $3 million ($4 million of assets minus $1 million of liabilities). When Company A records the transaction, it will:

Debit various asset accounts for $4 million
Credit various liability accounts for $1 million
Credit Cash for $5 million
Debit Goodwill for $2 million

The $2 million, that was over and above the fair value of the identifiable assets minus the liabilities, must have been for something else. We refer to that something else as goodwill.",what
What is the difference between a trial balance and a balance sheet?,"Definition of Trial Balance
A trial balance is an internal report that remains in the accounting department. The trial balance lists all of the accounts in the general ledger and their balances (or all of the accounts that have balances). However, the debit balance amounts are entered in one column and the credit balance amounts are entered in another column. Each column is then summed to prove that the total of the debit balances is equal to the total of the credit balances. (In a manual accounting system, the trial balance would draw attention to the errors occurring when transactions were journalized, posted, account balances computed, etc. With accounting software, these clerical errors are unlikely.)
Definition of Balance Sheet
A balance sheet is one of the five financial statements that are distributed outside of the accounting department and are often distributed outside of the company. The balance sheet summarizes and reports the balances from the asset, liability, and stockholders' equity accounts that are contained in the company's general ledger. The balance sheet is also referred to as the statement of financial position.",what
What is a current liability?,"Definition of Current Liability
A current liability is:

An obligation that will be due within one year of the date of the company's balance sheet, and
Will require the use of a current asset or will create another current liability

However, if a company's normal operating cycle is longer than one year, current liabilities are the obligations that will be due within the operating cycle.
Current liabilities are usually reported as a separate section of a company's balance sheet. This allows readers to subtract their total from the company's total amount of current assets in order to determine a company's working capital. (Dividing current assets by the current liabilities is the company's current ratio.)
Examples of Current Liabilities
The following are common examples of current liabilities:

Accounts payable or trade payables
Notes payable that will be due within one year
The principal portion of a long-term loan that must be paid within one year
Wages payable
Income taxes payable
Interest payable
Other accrued expenses payable
Deferred revenues and customer deposits",what
What is the days' sales in accounts receivable ratio?,"Definition of Days' Sales in Accounts Receivable
The days' sales in accounts receivable ratio (also known as the average collection period) tells you the number of days it took on average to collect the company's accounts receivable during the past year. 
Example of Calculating Days' Sales in Accounts Receivable
The days' sales in accounts receivable can be calculated as follows: the number of days in the year (use 360 or 365) divided by the accounts receivable turnover ratio during a past year. For example, if a company's accounts receivable turnover ratio for the past year was 10, the days' sales in accounts receivable was 36 days (360 days divided by the turnover ratio of 10).
Caution
The accounts receivable turnover ratio used above was calculated as follows:

The credit sales during the past year (cash sales are not included since they were not part of accounts receivable) divided by the next item...
The average accounts receivable balances during the past year

It is possible that within the average accounts receivable balances there are some receivables that are 120 days or more past due. These could easily be buried in the average if most customers are remitting the amounts by the dates the receivables are due. Therefore, it is best to review an aging of accounts receivable by customer to understand the detail behind the days' sales in accounts receivable ratio.",what
Where does revenue received in advance go on a balance sheet?,"Definition of Revenue Received in Advance
Under the accrual basis of accounting, revenues received in advance of being earned are reported as a liability. If they will be earned within one year, they should be listed as a current liability.
When a company receives money in advance of earning it, the accounting entry is a debit to the asset Cash for the amount received and a credit to the liability account such as Customer Advances or Unearned Revenues.
As the amount received in advance is earned, the liability account should be debited for the amount earned and a revenue account should be credited. This is done through an adjusting entry.
Examples of Revenue Received in Advance
The following are a few examples of revenue received in advance:

An insurance company receiving premiums for protection during the following six months
A magazine publisher receiving money from a subscriber for magazines for the following year
A website design company receiving a client's down payment for future work
A law firm receiving a retainer fee from a new client",what
What is the quick ratio?,"Definition of Quick Ratio
The quick ratio is a financial ratio used to gauge a company's liquidity. The quick ratio is also known as the acid test ratio.
The quick ratio compares the total amount of cash and cash equivalents + marketable securities + accounts receivable to the amount of current liabilities.
Example of Quick Ratio
If a company's cash and cash equivalents + marketable securities + accounts receivable adds up to $1,000,000 and the amount of the company's current liabilities is $1,200,000, its quick ratio is 0.83 to 1 ($1,000,000/$1,200,000 = 0.83).
The quick ratio differs from the current ratio in that some current assets are excluded from the quick ratio. The most significant current asset that is excluded is inventory. The reason is that inventory might not be ""quick"" to turn to cash.",what
How do you calculate accrued vacation pay?,"Definition of Accrued Vacation Pay
Accrued vacation pay is the amount of vacation pay that a company's employees have earned, but the company has not yet paid.
Example of Accrued Vacation Pay
Let's assume that a company has a formal agreement that provides its employees with 120 hours of paid vacation in the year following the employees' full-time employment. Let's also assume that the company has only one full-time employee who began working at the company on January 1 of the current year and has an hourly pay rate of $26. In the current year, this employee will earn vacation pay of $3,120 (120 hours x $26), or $60 per week ($3,120 per year divided by 52 weeks). This means that in the current year the company must record vacation pay expense and a related liability at a rate of $60 per week.
In our example, the company has only the one full-time employee, so the company's December 31 balance sheet must report a current liability of $3,120.
Vacation pay is an example of an accrued expense and an accrued liability that is required by the matching principle.
Balance Sheet: Retail/Wholesale - Corporation",what
What is deferred revenue?,"Deferred Revenue
Deferred revenue is money received by a company in advance of having earned it. In other words, deferred revenues are not yet revenues and therefore cannot yet be reported on the income statement. As a result, the unearned amount must be deferred to the company's balance sheet where it will be reported as a liability.
The title of the general ledger liability account may have the title of Unearned Revenues, Deferred Revenues, or Customer Deposits. As the deferred amount is earned, it should be moved from Unearned Revenues to an income statement revenue account (such as Sales Revenues, Service Revenues, Fees Earned, etc).
Example of Deferred Revenue
To illustrate deferred revenue, let's assume that a company designs websites and has been asked to provide a price quote for a new website. The design company states that it can complete the new website for $70,000. The terms require a payment of $30,000 at the time the contract is signed and $40,000 at the end of the project, which is estimated to take 60 days. The company agrees to begin working on the project 10 days after the $30,000 is received.
Now let's assume that on December 27, the design company receives the $30,000 and it will begin the project on January 4. Therefore, on December 27, the design company will record a debit of $30,000 to Cash and a credit of $30,000 to Deferred Revenues. On December 31, its balance sheet will report a current liability of $30,000 with the description Deferred revenues.
As of January 31 the company has completed 2/7 of the work. Therefore, it will record an adjusting entry dated January 31 that will debit Deferred Revenues for $20,000 and will credit the income statement account Design Revenues for $20,000. Thus, the January 31 balance sheet will report Deferred revenues of $10,000 (the company's remaining obligation/liability from the $30,000 it received on December 27).",what
What are net assets?,"Definition of Net Assets
Net assets is defined as total assets  minus total liabilities.
Examples of Net Assets
In a sole proprietorship the amount of net assets is reported as owner's equity.
In a corporation the amount of net assets is reported as stockholders' equity.
In a not-for-profit (NFP) organization, the net amount of its total assets minus total liabilities is actually reported as net assets in its statement of financial position.
The net assets section for the NFP organization is divided into two major classifications:

net assets without donor restrictions
net assets with donor restrictions",what
What is a creditor?,"Definition of Creditor
A creditor could be a bank, supplier or person that has provided money, goods, or services to a company and expects to be paid at a later date. In other words, the company owes money to its creditors and the amounts should be reported on the company's balance sheet as either a current liability or a non-current (or long-term) liability.
Examples of Creditors
Some creditors, such as banks and other lenders, have lent money to the company and will require the company to sign a written promissory note for the amount owed. When a promissory note is required, the company borrowing the money will record and report the amount owed as Notes Payable.
If the creditor is a vendor or supplier that did not require the company to sign a promissory note, the amount owed is likely to to be reported as Accounts Payable or Accrued Liabilities.
Other creditors include the company's employees (who are owed wages and bonuses), governments (who are owed taxes), and customers (who made deposits or other prepayments).
Some creditors are referred to as secured creditors because they have a registered lien on some of the company's assets. A creditor without a lien (or other legal claim) on the company's assets is an unsecured creditor.",what
What is the statement of financial position?,"Definition of Statement of Financial Position
The statement of financial position is another name for the balance sheet. It is one of the main financial statements.
The statement of financial position reports an entity's assets, liabilities, and the difference in their totals as of the final moment of an accounting period.
The structure of the statement of financial position is similar to the basic accounting equation. For a corporation the format will be: Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders' Equity. A nonprofit organization's format will be: Assets = Liabilities + Net Assets.
The statement of financial position must reflect the basic accounting principles and guidelines such as the cost, matching, and full disclosure principle to name a few. Accordingly, the statement of financial position is more meaningful when it is prepared under the accrual method of accounting.",what
What are adjusting entries?,"Definition of Adjusting Entries
Adjusting entries are usually made on the last day of an accounting period (year, quarter, month) so that a company's financial statements comply with the accrual method of accounting. In other words, the adjusting entries are needed so that a company's:

Income statement reports the revenues that have been earned during the accounting period
Balance sheet reports the receivables that it has a right to receive as of the end of the accounting period
Income statement reports the expenses  and losses that were incurred during the accounting period
Balance sheet reports the liabilities it has incurred as of the end of the accounting period

Examples of Adjusting Entries
Here are a few examples of the need for adjusting entries:

A company shipped goods on credit, but the company's sales invoice was not processed as of the end of the accounting period
A company received some goods from a vendor but the vendor's invoice had not been processed by the company as of the end of the accounting period
A company that prepares monthly income statements paid for 6 months of insurance coverage in the first month of the insurance coverage. (This means that 5/6 of the payment is a prepaid asset and only 1/6 of the payment should be reported as an expense on each of the monthly income statements.)
A company's customer paid in advance for services to be provided over several accounting periods. Until the services are provided, the unearned amount is reported as a liability. After the services are provided, an entry is needed to reduce the liability and to report the revenues.

Note that a common characteristic of every adjusting entry will involve at least one income statement account and at least one balance sheet account.",what
What will cause a change in net working capital?,"Definition of Net Working Capital
Net working capital,  which is also known as working capital, is defined as a company's current assets minus itscurrent liabilities.
Examples of Changes in Working Capital
If a company's owners invest additional cash in the company, the cash will increase the company's current assets with no increase in current liabilities. Therefore working capital will increase.
If a company obtains a long-term loan to replace a current liability, current liabilities will decrease but current assets do not change. Therefore working capital will increase.
If a company uses its cash to pay for a new vehicle or to expand one of its buildings, the company's current assets will decrease with no change to current liabilities. Therefore working capital will decrease.
If a company sells merchandise for $50,000 that was in inventory at a cost of $30,000, the company's current assets will increase by $20,000. If no other expenses are incurred, working capital will increase by $20,000.
If a company borrows $50,000 and agrees to repay the loan in 90 days, the company's working capital is unchanged. The reason is that the current asset Cash increased by $50,000 and the current liability Loans Payable increased by $50,000.
If a company collects $30,000 of its accounts receivable, there is no change in working capital since the current asset Cash increased, and another current asset Accounts Receivable decreased.",what
How do you record a payment for insurance?,"Definition of Payment for Insurance
A company's property insurance, liability insurance, business interruption insurance, etc. often covers a one-year period with the cost (insurance premiums) paid in advance. The one-year period for the insurance rarely coincides with the company's accounting year. Therefore, the insurance payments will likely involve more than one annual financial statement and many interim financial statements. 
Prepaid Insurance vs. Insurance Expense
When the insurance premiums are paid in advance, they are referred to as prepaid. At the end of any accounting period, the amount of the insurance premiums that remain prepaid should be reported in the current asset account, Prepaid Insurance. The prepaid amount will be reported on the balance sheet after inventory and could part of an item described as prepaid expenses.
As the prepaid amount expires, the balance in Prepaid Insurance is reduced by a credit to Prepaid Insurance and a debit to Insurance Expense. This is done with an adjusting entry at the end of each accounting period (e.g. monthly). One objective of the adjusting entry is to match the proper amount of insurance expense to the period indicated on the income statement.
Example of Payment for Insurance Expense
Let's assume that a company is started on December 1 and arranges for business insurance to begin on December 1. On December 1 the company pays the insurance company $12,000 for the insurance premiums covering one year. The company will record the payment with a debit of $12,000 to Prepaid Insurance and a credit of $12,000 to Cash.
On December 31, the company writes an adjusting entry to record the insurance expense that was used up (expired) and to reduce the amount that remains prepaid. This is accomplished with a debit of $1,000 to Insurance Expense and a credit of $1,000 to Prepaid Insurance. This same adjusting entry will be prepared at the end of each of the next 11 months.",what
How do I record a loan payment which includes paying both interest and principal?,"Definition of a Loan Payment
A loan payment is likely to consist of three amounts:

Total payment amount
Interest payment
Principal payment

Generally, the interest payment is related to the principal amount that is owed to the lender. Whenever a principal payment occurs, the balance of the principal amount owed will decrease. Therefore, the next interest payment will be smaller than the previous interest payment.
Example of Loan Payment
Let's assume that a company has a loan payment of $2,000 consisting of an interest payment of $500 and a principal payment of $1,500.
The company's entry to record the loan payment will be:

Debit of $500 to Interest Expense
Debit of $1,500 to Loans Payable
Credit of $2,000 to Cash

The credit balance in the company's liability account Loans Payable should agree with the principal balance in the lender's records. This can be confirmed on a loan statement from the lender or by asking the lender for the principal balance.",what
What are assets?,"Definition of Assets
In accounting and bookkeeping, a company's assets can be defined as:

Resources or things of value that are owned by a company as the result of company transactions
Prepaid expenses that have not yet been used up or have not yet expired
Costs that have a future value that can be measured

Assets are recorded at their cost and (except for some securities) are not adjusted for changes in market value. Long-term assets such as buildings and equipment are depreciated and therefore will be reported at less than their cost.
Assets are part of the accounting equation and the balance sheet, both of which are presented in this format:
Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders' (or Owner's) Equity.
Some of the company's most valuable assets may not have been acquired in a transaction and therefore are not listed as assets on the company's balance sheet. Examples include a highly-respected trade name, a valuable patent, a very effective management team and company culture.
Example of Assets
Examples of assets that are likely to be listed on a company's balance sheet include: cash, temporary investments, accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid expenses, long-term investments, land, buildings, machines, equipment, furniture, fixtures, vehicles, goodwill, and more.",what
How do cash dividends affect the financial statements?,"Definition of Cash Dividends
Cash dividends are a distribution of a corporation's earnings to its stockholders or shareholders. For cash dividends to occur, the corporation's board of directors must declare the dividends.
Examples of How Cash Dividends Affect the Financial Statements
When a corporation's board of directors declares a cash dividend on its stock, the following will occur:

Retained earnings (a part of stockholders' equity) will decrease
Current liabilities (such as Dividends Payable) will increase

When the cash dividend is paid, the following will occur:

Current liabilities (Dividends Payable) will decrease
Current assets (Cash) will decrease

The income statement is not affected by the declaration and payment of cash dividends on common stock. (However, the cash dividends on preferred stock are deducted from net income to arrive at net income available for common stock.)
The statement of cash flows will report the amount of the cash dividends as a use of cash in the financing activities section.",what
What is a balance sheet and why is it prepared?,"Definition of Balance Sheet
The balance sheet is prepared in order to report an organization's financial position at the end of an accounting period, such as midnight on December 31.
A corporation's balance sheet reports its:

Assets (resources that were acquired in past transactions)
Liabilities (obligations and customer deposits)
Stockholders' equity (the difference between the amount of assets and liabilities)

You can view the balance sheet as reporting the assets and the claims against those assets (liabilities and stockholders' equity). You can also view the balance sheet as reporting a corporation's assets and the amounts that were provided by creditors (the liabilities) and the amounts provided by the owners (the stockholders' equity).
A classified balance sheet reports the current assets in a section that is separate from the long-term assets. Similarly, current liabilities are reported in a section that is separate from long-term liabilities. This allows bankers, owners, and others to easily compute the amount of an organization's working capital and current ratio.
The balance sheet has some limitations. For example, the property, plant and equipment are reported at cost minus the accumulated depreciation (except land). If these assets have increased in value, the fair value is not reported because of the cost principle. Also, brand names and trademarks may have significant value, but cannot be reported on the balance sheet unless they were acquired in a business transaction.
The balance sheet should be read with the other financial statements (income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of cash flows, and the statement of changes in stockholders' equity) including the notes to the financial statements.",what
How are the balance sheet and income statement connected?,"Connection between Balance Sheet and Income Statement
The connection between the balance sheet and the income statement results from:

The use of double-entry accounting or bookkeeping, and
 The accounting equation Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity

Basically, the income statement components have the following effects on owner's equity:

Revenues and gains cause owner's (or stockholders') equity to increase
Expenses and losses cause owner's (or stockholders') equity to decrease

Example of How the Balance Sheet and Income Statement Are Connected
To illustrate the connection between the balance sheet and income statement, let's assume that a company's owner's equity was $40,000 at the beginning of the year, and it was $65,000 at the end of the year. Let's also assume that the owner did not invest or withdraw business assets during the year. Therefore, the $25,000 increase in owner's equity is likely the company's net income earned for the year. The details for the $25,000 (revenues, expenses, gains, losses) will be reported on the company's income statement for the year.
Accountants refer to the income statement accounts (revenues, expenses, gains, losses) as temporary accounts because their balances will be closed and transferred to the owner's capital account at the end of the year.",what
Is income tax an expense or liability?,"Definition of Income Tax
In the accounting for a regular U.S. corporation, income tax usually refers to the federal, state, local, and foreign countries' taxes that are levied based on a corporation's taxable income. The taxable income and the related income tax are found on the corporation's income tax return. (The corporation's taxable income is based on the income tax laws and regulations of the various governments.)
The accounting and financial reporting of a regular corporation's income taxes is complicated because the accounting principles are likely to be different from the income tax laws and regulations. Generally, a profitable regular corporation's financial statements will report both income tax expense and a current liability such as income taxes payable.
Examples of Income Tax Expense and Income Taxes Payable
A profitable corporation's financial statements will report:

Income tax expense on its income statement for the revenues and expenses appearing on the accounting period's income statement, and
Income taxes payable (a current liability on the balance sheet) for the amount of income taxes owed to the various governments as of the date of the balance sheet

If a corporation has overpaid its income taxes and is entitled to a refund, the amount will be reported on the balance sheet as a current asset such as Other receivables.
If there are differences between the time when certain revenues and expenses are reported on the income tax returns versus when they are reported on the financial statements, the amount of the deferred income tax will likely be reported on the balance sheet as a noncurrent liability as Deferred income taxes.",what
What does capitalize mean?,"The word capitalize means to record the amount of an item in a balance sheet account as opposed to the income statement. (The accounts in the general ledger and in the chart of accounts consist of two types of accounts: balance sheet accounts and income statement accounts.)
To illustrate, let's assume that your company purchases a new computer printer for your office. Its cost is $700. If your company is a small company, it might capitalize the cost of the printer. That means the printer will be included in an equipment account and will be reported in the property, plant and equipment section of the balance sheet. Its cost will be depreciated over the printer's useful life.
A larger company might decide that $700 is an immaterial amount and will not capitalize the printer as an asset. Rather, the large company will expense the printer immediately. (This larger company might have a policy of not capitalizing any asset with a cost of less than $1,000 because of the materiality convention. This is allowed because no reader of the financial statement is going to be misled because the $700 will appear as an expense in the year the printer is purchased instead of $140 in that year and $140 in each of the subsequent four years.)
Another example of capitalize involves leased equipment. If your company leases a forklift truck, is the lease a rental agreement, or is the lease really a disguised purchase and financing arrangement? If it is the latter, then the forklift truck and the lease should be capitalized. The forklift truck should appear on the balance sheet as part of the company's equipment, and the amount of principal owed needs to be reported as a liability on the balance sheet.",what
Is the drawing account a capital account?,"Definition of Drawing Account
A sole proprietorship will have a drawing account in which the owner's withdrawals or draws of cash or other assets are recorded. The amounts of the owner's draws are recorded with a debit to the drawing account and a credit to cash or other asset. At the end of the accounting year, the drawing account is closed by transferring the debit balance to the owner's capital account.
The Drawing Account is a Capital Account
To answer your question, the drawing account is a capital account. It's debit balance will reduce the owner's capital account balance and the owner's equity. The drawing account's purpose is to report separately the owner's draws during each accounting year. Since the capital account and owner's equity accounts are expected to have credit balances, the drawing account (having a debit balance) is considered to be a contra account. In addition, the drawing account is a temporary account since its balance is closed to the capital account at the end of each accounting year. 
Example of the Drawing Account
Let's assume that L. Ott begins a sole proprietorship with a cash investment of $3,000. The journal entry will debit Cash for $3,000 and will credit L. Ott, Capital for $3,000. Later, the L. Ott withdraws $500 from the business for her personal use. The journal entry for this transaction will debit L. Ott, Drawing for $500 and will credit Cash for $500. After this transaction, the business will have assets of $2,500 and will have owner's equity of $2,500.",what
What is Notes Payable?,"Definition of Notes Payable
In accounting, Notes Payable is a general ledger liability account in which a company records the face amounts of the promissory notes that it has issued. The balance in Notes Payable represents the amounts that remain to be paid. Since a note payable will require the issuer/borrower to pay interest, the issuing company will have interest expense. Under the accrual method of accounting, the company will also have another liability account entitled Interest Payable. In this account the company records the interest that it has incurred but has not paid as of the end of the accounting period.
For most companies the amounts in Notes Payable and Interest Payable are reported on the balance sheet as follows:

the amount due within one year of the balance sheet date will be a current liability, and
the amount not due within one year of the balance sheet date will be a noncurrent or long-term liability.

The company should also disclose pertinent information for the amounts owed on the notes. This will include the interest rates, maturity dates, collateral pledged, limitations imposed by the creditor, etc.
Examples on Notes Payable
Notes payable are required when a company borrows money from a bank or other lender. Notes payable may also be part of a transaction to acquire expensive equipment. In certain cases, a supplier will require a note payable instead of terms such as net 30 days.",what
What is the accounts receivable turnover ratio?,"Definition of Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio
The accounts receivable turnover ratio is an important financial ratio that indicates a company's ability to collect its accounts receivable. Collecting accounts receivable is critical for a company to pay its obligations when they are due.
The calculation of the accounts receivable turnover ratio is: credit sales for a year divided by the company's average amount of accounts receivable throughout that year. Note that only the company's credit sales (or sales on credit) are used in the calculation, since cash sales do not involve accounts receivable.
Example of Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio
To illustrate the calculation of the accounts receivable turnover, let's assume that a company’s credit sales for the most recent year were $6,000,000 and its average amount of accounts receivable during that year were $600,000. As a result, the accounts receivable turnover ratio is: credit sales of $6,000,000 divided by the average amount of accounts receivable of $600,000 = 10 times a year. This indicates that on average the company’s accounts receivables turned over 10 times during the year, or approximately every 36 days (360 or 365 days per year divided by the turnover of 10).
Whether the accounts receivable turnover ratio of 10 is good or bad depends on the company's past ratios, the average for other companies in the same industry, and the specific credit terms given to the company's customers.
Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio is an Average
It is important to emphasize that the accounts receivable turnover ratio is an average, since an average can hide important details. For example, some past due receivables could be ""hidden"" or offset by receivables that have paid faster than the average. If you have access to the company's details, you should review a detailed aging of accounts receivable to detect slow paying customers.",what
What is an imprest system of petty cash?,"Definition of Petty Cash
Petty cash refers to a small amount of currency and coins that a company uses to pay small amounts without writing a check. The amount of petty cash (also known as the petty cash fund) varies by company or organization. For now, let's assume that the amount is $100.
One person is designated as the petty cash custodian. This person is responsible for disbursing the small amounts
and for documenting each payment with a petty cash receipt.
Definition of an Imprest System of Petty Cash
An imprest system of petty cash means that the general ledger account Petty Cash will remain dormant at a constant amount. If the amount of petty cash is $100, then the Petty Cash account will always report a debit balance of $100. This $100 is the imprest balance. As long as $100 is adequate for the organization's small disbursements, then the general ledger account Petty Cash will never be debited or credited again.
When the currency and coins on hand gets low, the petty cash custodian will request a check to replenish the coins and currency that were disbursed. Since the requested check is drawn on the organization's checking account, the Cash account (not the Petty Cash account) will be credited. The debits will go to the expense accounts indicated by the petty cash receipts, such as postage expense, supplies expense. In other words, the general ledger account Petty Cash is not involved in the replenishment. (Replenishment means getting the total of the currency and coins back to the imprest amount.) The petty cash custodian will cash the check and add the amount to the other cash. 
Under the imprest system, the petty cash custodian should at all times have a combination of currency, coins, and petty cash receipts that equals $100 (the imprest petty cash balance).
Control over the petty cash occurs during the replenishment process. The person approving the check for the petty cash custodian to cash should review the petty cash receipts and attach them to the check request. Control can also occur when an independent person confirms that the petty cash custodian's cash and receipts adds up to the imprest amount.",what
What is the difference between a nominal account and a real account?,"Definition of Nominal Account
The balance in a nominal account is closed at the end of the accounting year. As a result, a nominal account begins each accounting year with a zero balance. Since the balance does not carry forward to the next accounting year, a nominal account is also referred to as a temporary account.
Examples of Nominal Accounts
The nominal accounts are almost always the income statement accounts such as the accounts for recording revenues, expenses, gains, and losses. When the income statement accounts are closed at the end of the accounting year, the net amount will ultimately end up in a balance sheet equity account such as the proprietor's capital account or the corporation's retained earnings account.
Definition of Real Account
The balance in a real account is not closed at the end of the accounting year. As a result, a real account begins each accounting year with its balance from the end of the previous year. Because the end-of-the-year balance is carried forward to the next accounting year, a real account is also known as a permanent account.
Examples of Real Accounts
The real accounts are the balance sheet accounts such as the accounts for recording assets, liabilities, and the owner's (or stockholders') equity. However, the sole proprietor's drawing account, which is reported on the balance sheet during the year, is a temporary account because it is closed directly to the owner's capital account at the end of the year.",what
What are balance sheet accounts?,"Definition of Balance Sheet Accounts
Balance sheet accounts are one of two types of general ledger accounts. (The other accounts in the general ledger are the income statement accounts.) 
Balance sheet accounts are used to sort and store transactions involving a company's assets, liabilities, and owner's or stockholders' equity. The balances in these accounts as of the final moment of an accounting year will be reported on the company's end-of-year balance sheet.
Balance sheet accounts are also referred to as permanent or real accounts because at the end of the accounting year the balances in these accounts are not closed. Instead, the ending balances will be carried forward to become the beginning balances in the next accounting year. (This is different from the income statement accounts which are closed at the end of each accounting year and will begin the following year with zero balances.)
Examples of Balance Sheet Accounts
Examples of a corporation's balance sheet accounts include Cash, Temporary Investments, Accounts Receivable, Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, Inventory, Investments, Land, Buildings, Equipment, Furniture and Fixtures, Accumulated Depreciation, Notes Payable, Accounts Payable, Payroll Taxes Payable, Paid-in Capital, Retained Earnings, and others.",what
What is the meaning of debtor?,"Definition of Debtor
A debtor is a person, company, or other entity that owes money. In other words, the debtor has a debt or legal obligation to pay the amount owed. 
Example of Debtor
If a company borrows $10,000 from a bank, the company is the debtor and the bank is the creditor.",what
What is the carrying amount?,"Definition of Carrying Amount
The term carrying amount is also known as book value or carrying value. The term carrying amount is often used when there is a valuation account associated with another general ledger account. 
Examples of Carrying Amount
Here are some examples when the term carrying amount or carrying value is used:

A company's Accounts Receivable has a debit balance of $84,000. The company's Allowance for Doubtful Accounts has a credit balance of $3,000. The carrying amount or carrying value of the receivables is $81,000.
A company has a truck that has its cost of $50,000 in its account entitled Truck. The associated account Accumulated Depreciation has a credit balance of $43,000. The truck's carry amount or book value is $7,000.
A corporation has Bonds Payable of $3,000,000 and Unamortized Discount on Bonds Payable of $150,000 and Unamortized Issue Costs of $50,000. The carrying value of the bonds is $2,800,000.",what
What is a long-term liability?,"Definition of Long-term Liability
A long-term liability is an obligation resulting from a previous event that is not due within one year of the date of the balance sheet (or not due within the company's operating cycle if it is longer than one year). Long-term liabilities are also known as noncurrent liabilities.
Examples of Long-term Liabilities
Some examples of long-term liabilities are the noncurrent portions of the following:

bonds payable
long-term loans
pension liabilities
postretirement healthcare liabilities
deferred compensation
deferred revenues
deferred income taxes
customer deposits

Some long-term debt that will be due within one year of the balance sheet date can continue to be reported as a long-term liability if there is:

a long-term investment that is sufficient and restricted for the payment of the debt, or
intent and a noncancelable arrangement that assures that the long-term debt will be replaced with new long-term debt or with capital stock.",what
What is a noncurrent asset?,"Definition of Noncurrent Asset
A noncurrent asset is an asset that is not  expected to turn to cash within one year of date shown on a company's balance sheet. (This assumes that the company has an operating cycle of less than one year.)
A noncurrent asset is also known as a long-term asset.
Noncurrent assets are reported under the following balance sheet headings:

Investments (long-term)
Property, plant and equipment
Intangible assets
Other assets

Examples of Noncurrent Assets
Examples of noncurrent or long-term assets include:

Cash surrender value of life insurance
Bond sinking fund
Certain investments in other corporations
Plant assets such as land, buildings, equipment, furnishings, vehicles, leasehold improvements
Intangible assets such as goodwill, trademarks, mailing lists",what
Is a loan's principal payment included on the income statement?,"Definition of Loan Principal Payment
When a company borrows money from its bank, the amount received is recorded with a debit to Cash and a credit to a liability account, such as Notes Payable or Loans Payable, which is reported on the company's balance sheet. The cash received from the bank loan is referred to as the principal amount.
The principal amount received from the bank is not part of a company's revenues and therefore will not be reported on the company's income statement. Similarly, any repayment of the principal amount will not be an expense and therefore will not be reported on the income statement. The principal payment is recorded as a reduction of the liability Notes Payable or Loans Payable. (Both the receipt of the loan principal amount and the repayment of the loan principal will be reported on the statement of cash flows.) The interest on the loan will be reported as expense on the income statement in the periods when the interest is incurred.
Example of a Loan Principal Payment
Let's assume that a company borrows $10,000 from its bank. The company's cash increases by $10,000 and its liability Loans Payable increases by $10,000. Let's also assume that the company makes a payment of $1,000 consisting of $60 for interest and $940 for principal, the entry will be:

Debit of $60 to Interest Expense (an income statement account)
Debit of $940 to Loans Payable (a balance sheet account)
Credit of $1,000 to Cash (a balance sheet account)

Notice that only the interest expense of $60 will be included on the income statement.",what
How do you report a write-down in inventory?,"Definition of Write-down in Inventory
Under FIFO and average cost methods, when the net realizable value of inventory is less than the cost of the inventory, there needs to be a reduction in the inventory amount. Often the balance in the current asset account Inventory is reduced through a credit to a contra inventory account, which is referred to as a valuation account. The debit in the entry to write down inventory is recorded in an account such as Loss on Write-Down of Inventory, which is an income statement account.
Example of Reporting a Write-down in Inventory
Under FIFO and average cost methods, if the net realizable value is less than the inventory's cost, the balance sheet must report the lower amount. If the amount of the Loss on Write-Down of Inventory is relatively small, it can be reported on the income statement as part of the cost of goods sold. If the amount of the Loss on Write-Down of Inventory is significant, it should be reported as a separate line on the income statement.
Since the amount of the write-down of inventory reduces net income, it will also reduce the amount reported on the balance sheet for owner's equity or stockholders' equity. Thus, the balance sheet and the accounting equation will show a reduction in inventory and in owner's or stockholders' equity.",what
Is a security deposit a current asset?,"Definition of Security Deposit
A security deposit is often an amount paid by a tenant to a landlord to hold until the tenant moves. The amount of the security deposit is refundable to the tenant, if the rental unit remains in its present condition.
Since the security deposit is refundable (and the tenant intends to comply with the specified conditions) the tenant that paid the security deposit will report the amount as an asset. If the tenant intends to occupy the rental unit for more than one year, the security deposit should be reported as a long-term asset (or noncurrent asset) under the balance sheet classification ""Other assets"".
The landlord that receives and holds the security deposit should report the amount as a liability.
Example of a Security Deposit
A company agrees to rent office space and intends to occupy the space for 3 years. The landlord requires a security deposit of $1,000. The company debits the long-term asset Security Deposit for $1,000 and credits Cash for $1,000.
The landlord debits Cash for $1,000 and credits a liability account such as Refundable Security Deposits for $1,000.",what
What is the purpose of subsidiary ledgers?,"Definition of Subsidiary Ledger
A subsidiary ledger contains the details to support a general ledger control account. For instance, the subsidiary ledger for accounts receivable contains the information for each of the company's credit sales to customers, each customer's remittance, return of merchandise, discounts, and so on. With these details in the subsidiary ledger, the Accounts Receivable account in the general ledger can report summary amounts for the accounts receivable activity.
Examples of Subsidiary Ledgers
By having the details of the accounts receivable activity in a subsidiary ledger, employees in a company's credit department of a company can access the credit sales information without having access to any information in the general ledger.
In job order costing systems, the job cost sheets (or job cost records) will serve as the subsidiary ledger containing the details for the general ledger account Work in Process. The Work in Process account will now be a control account containing summary amounts for direct materials, direct labor, factory overhead applied, transfers to finished goods, etc. Manufacturing personnel will have full access to the job cost sheets without having access to other information in the general ledger.
Since companies are integrating accounting records with their other information into one database, I assume there will be less use of the term subsidiary ledgers in the future. There will likely be reports generated to provide the information formerly contained in the subsidiary ledger.",what
What is working capital?,"Definition of Working Capital
Working capital is the amount of a company's current assets minus the amount of its current liabilities. 
Example of Working Capital
Let's assume that a company's balance sheet dated June 30 reports the following amounts:

Total amount of current assets is $323,000
Total amount of current liabilities is $310,000

Therefore, the company's working capital on June 30 was $13,000. If one year earlier the company had current assets of $210,000 and current liabilities of $60,000, its working capital was $150,000.
Additional Comments on Working Capital
The adequacy of a company's working capital depends on the industry in which it competes, its relationship with its customers and suppliers, and other factors such as the following:

The types of current assets and how quickly they can be converted to cash. For instance, marketable securities can be converted to cash much faster than inventory.
The nature of the company's sales and how customers pay. If a company has very consistent sales via the Internet and its customers pay with credit cards at the time they place the order, a small amount of working capital may be sufficient. However, another company in an industry where the credit terms are net 60 days will need a greater amount of working capital.
Having an approved credit line with no borrowing allows a company to operate comfortably with a small amount of working capital.

In short, there is more to working capital than simply subtracting current liabilities from current assets.",what
"What is reported as property, plant and equipment?","Definition of Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment is the long-term asset or noncurrent asset section of the balance sheet that reports the tangible, long-lived assets that are used in the company's operations. These assets are commonly referred to as the company's fixed assets or plant assets.
Generally, the property, plant and equipment assets are reported at their cost followed by a deduction for the accumulated depreciation that applies to all of these assets except land (which is not depreciated).
Examples of Property, Plant and Equipment
Typical assets that are included in property, plant and equipment are land, buildings, machinery, equipment, vehicles, furniture, fixtures, office equipment, etc. which are used in the business. Also included in this balance sheet classification is a subtraction of the accumulated depreciation that pertains to these assets.",what
What is the current ratio?,"Definition of Current Ratio
The current ratio is a financial ratio that shows the proportion of a company's current assets to its current liabilities. The current ratio is often classified as a liquidity ratio and a larger current ratio is better than a smaller one. However, a company's liquidity is dependent on converting the current assets to cash in time to pay its obligations. 
Example of Current Ratio
If a company's current assets are $600,000 and its current liabilities are $200,000 the current ratio is 3:1. If the current assets are $600,000 and the current liabilities are $500,000 the current ratio is 1.2:1. Obviously a larger current ratio is better than a smaller ratio. Some people feel that a current ratio that is less than 1:1 indicates insolvency. However, some online sellers with customers paying with credit cards at the time of ordering may operate comfortably with a very low current ratio. 
It is wise to compare a company's current ratio to that of other companies in the same industry. You are also wise to compare a company's recent current ratio to its ratio at earlier dates. In other words, spotting a trend can be important.
Caution
The composition of the current assets is also an important consideration. If the current assets are predominantly in cash, marketable securities, and collectible accounts receivable, that is likely to provide more liquidity than a huge amount of slow moving inventory.",what
What is an impairment?,"Definition of Impairment
The term impairment is associated with an asset currently having a market value that is less than the asset's book value . A test is done to determine whether the asset's book value should be reduced to the current market value and to report the amount of the write-down (reduction) as a loss on its income statement.
Examples of Impairment
A meat packing plant in recent years invested large amounts in its plant and equipment. Since then, the company experienced a dramatic decline in the demand for its products and in the value of its plant and equipment. If the required test of impairment indicates that a loss must be recorded on its plant and equipment, its book value must be reduced and the resulting loss reported on its income statement.
A second example is Corporation X that acquired another company. The amount paid for the company resulted in Corporation X reporting a large amount for the intangible asset goodwill. Since the acquisition, the acquired company's value has declined to only a small fraction of the amount currently reported as goodwill. A test must be done and it may require a reduction in the reported amount of goodwill and a resulting impairment loss reported on the company's income statement.",what
What type of account is the Dividends account?,"Definition of Dividends Account
The account Dividends (or Cash Dividends Declared) is a temporary, stockholders' equity account that is debited for the amount of the dividends that a corporation declares on its capital stock. At the end of the accounting year, the balance in the Dividends account is closed by transferring the account balance to Retained Earnings. (Corporations could debit Retained Earnings directly when dividends are declared. In that case the Dividends account is not used.) 
Example of Using the Dividends Account
When a corporation declares a cash dividend on its common stock, it will credit a current liability account Dividends Payable and will debit either:

Retained Earnings, or
Dividends

Dividends is a balance sheet account. However, it is a temporary account because its debit balance will be closed to the Retained Earnings account at the end of the accounting year.",what
When does a negative cash balance appear on the balance sheet?,"Definition of Negative Cash Balance
A negative cash balance results when the cash account in a company's general ledger has a credit balance. The credit or negative balance in the checking account is usually caused by a company writing checks for more than it has in its checking account.
Example of Reporting Negative Cash on the Balance Sheet
When a company prepares its balance sheet, a negative balance in the cash account should be reported as a current liability which it might describe as checks written in excess of cash balance. The logic is that the company likely issued the checks to reduce its accounts payable. Since the issued checks will not be paid by the company's bank, the company still has the liability.
A negative cash balance in the general ledger does not mean that the company's bank account is overdrawn. Let's assume that a company writes checks for $100,000 and mails them at the end of the day to suppliers in another state. Those checks might not clear the company's bank account until three or four days later. Therefore, it is possible that the company's Cash account shows a negative $40,000 but at the bank the company's checking account balance could have a positive balance of $60,000. If the company deposits at least $40,000 tomorrow morning, the bank balance will be large enough for the bank to pay the $100,000 of checks it had written.",what
What is the difference between liability and debt?,"Definition of Liability
In accounting and bookkeeping, the term liability refers to a company's obligation arising from a past transaction.
Examples of Liabilities
A few of the more common types of liabilities include:

Accounts payable
Loans or notes payable
Accrued expenses payable
Deferred revenues
Bonds payable
Income taxes payable and deferred income taxes

Definition of Debt
When some people use the term debt, they are referring to all of the amounts that a company owes. In other words, they use the term debt to mean total liabilities.
Others use the term debt to mean only the formal, written loans and bonds payable.
Examples of Debt
As an example of debt meaning the total amount of a company's liabilities, we look to the debt-to-equity ratio. In the calculation of that financial ratio, debt  means the total amount of liabilities (not merely the amount of short-term and long-term loans and bonds payable).
Others use the word debt  to mean only the formal, written financing agreements such as short-term loans payable, long-term loans payable, and bonds payable.
This is a good reminder that people have different perspectives and understandings of accounting terms.",what
What is prepaid insurance?,"Definition of Prepaid Insurance
Prepaid insurance is the portion of an insurance premium that has been paid in advance and has not expired as of the date of a company's balance sheet. This unexpired cost is reported in the current asset account Prepaid Insurance.
As the amount of prepaid insurance expires, the expired portion is moved from the current asset account Prepaid Insurance to the income statement account Insurance Expense. This is usually done at the end of each accounting period through an adjusting entry.
Example of Prepaid Insurance
To illustrate prepaid insurance, let's assume that on November 20 a company pays an insurance premium of $2,400 for insurance protection during the six-month period of December 1 through May 31. On November 20, the payment is entered with a debit of $2,400 to Prepaid Insurance and a credit of $2,400 to Cash.
As of November 30 none of the $2,400 cost has expired and the entire $2,400 will be reported on the balance sheet as Prepaid Insurance or Prepaid Expenses. On December 31, an adjusting entry will debit Insurance Expense for $400 (the amount that expired: 1/6 of $2,400) and will credit Prepaid Insurance for $400. This means that the debit balance in Prepaid Insurance at December 31 will be $2,000 (5/6 of the $2,400 cost), since this is the amount that has not yet expired.
At the end of each month, an adjusting entry of $400 will be recorded to debit Insurance Expense and credit Prepaid Insurance.",what
What is the days' sales in inventory ratio?,"Definition of Days' Sales in Inventory
The financial ratio days' sales in inventory tells you the number of days it took a company to sell its inventory during a recent year. Keep in mind that a company's inventory will change throughout the year, and its sales will fluctuate as well. Therefore, you should view this as an average from the past.
The calculation of the days' sales in inventory is: the number of days in a year (365 or 360 days) divided by the inventory turnover ratio.
Example of Days' Sales in Inventory
To illustrate the days' sales in inventory, let's assume that in the previous year a company had an inventory turnover ratio of 9. Using 360 as the number of days in the year, the company's days' sales in inventory was 40 days (360 days divided by 9). Since sales and inventory levels usually fluctuate during a year, the 40 days is an average from a previous time.
It is important to realize that a financial ratio will likely vary between industries. Hence, a company's ratios should be compared to its own past financial ratios and to the ratios of companies within its industry.",what
What is the monthly close?,"Definition of Monthly Close
In accounting, monthly close is a series of steps and procedures that are followed so that a company's monthly financial statements are in compliance with the accrual method of accounting.
Since a company's business activities are ongoing, accountants might state ""we need to get a proper ""cut-off"" between the end-of-the-month transactions and those that belong in the following month.
If a company sells goods and has inventories, its monthly close will be more challenging. The company must be certain that the costs of the goods purchased are recorded in the same month as the goods are added to the inventories.
Reviewing the financial statements before they are distributed is also an important step in the monthly close. This could mean comparing the amounts and percentages on the current financial statements to those of earlier months. For example, if the current income statement shows the cost of goods sold as 86% instead of the normal 81%, the current month's amounts should be investigated before releasing the financial statements.",what
What is Construction Work-in-Progress?,"Definition of Construction Work-in-Progress
Construction Work-in-Progress is a noncurrent asset account in which the costs of constructing long-term, fixed assets are recorded. The account Construction Work-in-Progress will have a debit balance and will be reported on the balance sheet as part of a company's noncurrent or long-term asset section entitled  Property, plant and equipment.
The costs of constructing the asset are accumulated in the account Construction Work-in-Progress until the asset is completed and placed into service. When the asset is placed into service, the account Construction Work-in-Progress will be credited for its balance (the accumulated costs) and will be recorded with a debit in the appropriate property, plant and equipment account.
Depreciation will begin after the asset is put into service.
Example of Construction Work-in-Progress
Let's assume that a company is expanding its warehouse and the project is expected to take four months to complete. The company will open the account Construction Work-in-Progress for Warehouse Expansion to accumulate the many expenditures that will occur. When the project is completed, the company will transfer the amount from Construction Work-in-Progress for Warehouse Expansion to the asset account Warehouse Expansion.",what
What is the difference between accounts payable and accrued expenses payable?,"Definition of Accounts Payable
Accounts Payable is a liability account in which suppliers' or vendors' approved invoices are recorded. As a result, the balance in Accounts Payable should be a precise amount.
Definition of Accrued Expenses Payable
Accrued Expenses Payable is a liability account that records amounts that are owed, but the vendors' invoices have not yet been received and/or have not yet been recorded in Accounts Payable as of the end of the accounting period. The amounts in this account are usually recorded with accrual adjusting entries made at the end of the accounting period.
Examples of Accrued Expenses Payable
In addition to the amounts associated with vendors' invoices, accrued expenses may also include wages, interest, utilities, and other expenses that were incurred and owed, but not yet recorded in the general ledger accounts. Some of the amounts recorded in Accrued Expenses Payable may be estimated amounts that should supported by reasonable and documented calculations.

How do you calculate the gain or loss when an asset is sold?,"Definition of Gain or Loss on Sale of an Asset
The gain or loss on the sale of an asset used in a business is the difference between 1) the amount of cash that a company receives, and 2) the asset's book value (carrying value) at the time of the sale.
In order to know the asset's book value at the time of the sale, the depreciation expense for the asset must be recorded right up to the date that the asset is sold.
If the cash received is greater than the asset's book value, the difference is recorded as a gain. If the cash received is less than the asset's book value, the difference is recorded as a loss.
Example of a Gain on the Sale of an Asset
On March 31, a company sells its old delivery van for $4,000. The van's original cost was $45,000 and its accumulated depreciation was $43,600 as of the date of the sale. Therefore, the van's book value as of March 31 was $1,400 (cost of $45,000 minus accumulated depreciation of $43,600). Since the $4,000 of cash received by the company was greater than the van's book value of $1,400, there is a gain on the sale of the van of $2,600 ($4,000 minus $1,400).
The gain could also be determined by preparing the journal entry for the transaction:

Debit Cash for $4,000
Debit Accumulated Depreciation for $43,600 (to remove the credit balance)
Credit Delivery Van for $45,000 (to remove the original cost)
Credit Gain on Sale of Van for $2,600 (needed to balance the entry)

The credit of $2,600 will result in the entry having debits of $47,600 and credits of $47,600.",what
What is the difference between periodic and perpetual inventory systems?,"Periodic Inventory System
In a periodic system the account Inventory:

Has only the ending balance from the previous accounting year
Excludes the cost of purchases, purchases returns and allowances, etc. since these are recorded in accounts such as Purchases, Purchases Returns and Allowances, Purchases Discounts, etc.
Must be adjusted at the end of the accounting year in order to report the costs actually in inventory
Requires a physical inventory at least once per year and estimates within the year
Requires a cost flow assumption (FIFO, LIFO, average)

The periodic inventory system requires a calculation to determine the cost of goods sold.
Perpetual Inventory System
In a perpetual system the account Inventory:

Is debited whenever there is a purchase of goods (there is no Purchases account)
Is credited for the cost of the items sold (and the account Cost of Goods Sold is debited
Has a continuously or perpetually changing balance because of the above entries
Requires a physical inventory to correct any errors in the Inventory account
Requires a cost flow assumption (FIFO, LIFO, average)

With the perpetual inventory system, the cost of goods sold is readily available in the account Cost of Goods Sold.
[It is possible that a company uses the periodic system in its general ledger, but uses a different computer system outside of its general ledger to track the flow of goods in and out of inventory.]",what
What is materiality?,"Definition of Materiality
In accounting, materiality refers to the relative size of an amount. Relatively large amounts are material, while relatively small amounts are not material (or immaterial). Determining materiality requires professional judgement. For instance, a $20,000 amount will likely be immaterial for a large corporation with a net income of $900,000. However, the same $20,000 amount will be material for a small corporation with a net income of $40,000.
Another view of materiality is whether sophisticated investors would be misled if the amount was omitted or misclassified. If sophisticated investors would be misled or would have made a different decision, the amount is considered to be material. If sophisticated investors would not be misled or would not have made a different decision, the amount is judged to be immaterial. 
Example of Materiality
A classic example of the materiality concept is a company expensing a $20 wastebasket in the year it is acquired instead of depreciating it over its useful life of 10 years. The matching principle directs you to record the wastebasket as an asset and then report depreciation expense of $2 a year for 10 years. Materiality allows you to expense the entire $20 cost in the year it is acquired. The reason is that no investor, creditor, or other interested party would be misled by immediately expensing the $20 wastebasket.
Materiality also justifies large corporations having a policy of immediately expensing assets having a cost of less than $2,500 instead of setting up fixed asset records and depreciating those assets over their useful lives.",what
What is the difference between cost and expense?,"Definition of Cost
A cost might be an expense or it might be an asset. 
Definition of Expense
An expense is a cost that has expired or was necessary in order to earn revenues. The matching principle guides accountants as to when a cost will be reported as an expense. 
Example of a Cost
A company's property insurance bill for the next six months of insurance shows a cost of $6,000. Initially the cost of $6,000 is reported as the current asset Prepaid Insurance (or Prepaid Expense) since the cost has not been used up (has not expired).
Example of an Expense
As a prepaid cost such as the $6,000 in the asset account Prepaid Insurance expires, the part that expires will be reported on the income statement as Insurance Expense. If the insurance cost is expiring at a rate of $1,000 per month, then each month the amount in the asset account Prepaid Insurance will decrease by $1,000 and Insurance Expense of $1,000 will be reported on the income statement.",what
What is net realizable value?,"Definition of Net Realizable Value
Net realizable value (NRV) is the cash amount that a company expects to receive. Hence, net realizable value is sometimes referred to as cash realizable value.
We often find the term net realizable value being associated with the current assets accounts receivable and inventory. While these two assets are initially recorded at cost, there are occasions when the company will collect less than the cost. When that occurs, the company must report the lower of 1) cost, or 2) the net realizable value. 
In the case of accounts receivable, net realizable value can also be expressed as the debit balance in the asset account Accounts Receivable minus the credit balance in the contra asset account Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts. 
In the context of inventory, net realizable value is the expected selling price in the ordinary course of business minus any costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.
Examples of Net Realizable Value
If Accounts Receivable has a debit balance of $100,000 and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts has a proper credit balance of $8,000, the resulting net realizable value of the accounts receivable is $92,000. Adjustments to the Allowance account are reported on the income statement as bad debts expense.
Now, let's assume that a company's inventory has a cost of $15,000. However, at the end of the accounting year the inventory can be sold for only $14,000 after it spends $2,000 for packaging, sales commissions, and shipping. Therefore, the net realizable value of the inventory is $12,000 (selling price of $14,000 minus $2,000 of costs to dispose of the goods). In that situation the inventory must be reported at the lower of 1) the cost of $15,000, or 2) the NRV of $12,000. In this situation, the inventory should be reported on the balance sheet at $12,000, and the income statement should report a loss of $3,000 due to the write-down of inventory.",what
How do you record an owner's money that is used to start a company?,"Recording Money to Start a Sole Proprietorship
If Amy Ott begins a sole proprietorship by putting money into her business, the sole proprietorship will debit Cash and will credit the Amy Ott, Capital. If Amy Ott also lends some money to the business, the entry will be to debit Cash and credit a liability account such as Notes Payable. (If Amy invests an asset other than cash, the business will record the cash equivalent or fair market value of the asset.)
Recording Money to Start a Corporation
If Amy Ott decided to form a regular corporation and invest cash in exchange for shares of the new corporation's common stock, Cash will be debited and the account Common Stock will be credited. (If the common stock has a par value, Paid-in Capital in Excess of Par is also used.) If Amy also lends cash to the corporation, Cash will be debited and the liability account Notes Payable to Stockholder will be credited. (If Amy invests an asset other than cash, the corporation will record the cash equivalent or fair market value of the asset, unless the fair value of the common stock being issued has a more clear value.)
You should consult with your accounting and tax professional as well as an attorney regarding the type of business structure to be used and the pros and cons of investing versus lending to a new business.",what
What is the working capital turnover ratio?,"Definition of Working Capital Turnover Ratio
The working capital turnover ratio is also referred to as net sales to working capital. It indicates a company's effectiveness in using its working capital.
The working capital turnover ratio is calculated as follows: net annual sales divided by the average amount of working capital during the same year.
Example of Working Capital Turnover Ratio
To illustrate the working capital turnover ratio, let's assume that a company's net sales for the most recent year were $2,400,000 and its average amount of working capital during the year was $400,000. Therefore, its working capital turnover ratio was: net sales of $2,400,000 divided by average working capital of $400,000 = 6 times during the year.
As with most financial ratios, you should compare the working capital turnover ratio to other companies in the same industry and to the same company's past and planned working capital turnover ratios.",what
Where are accruals reflected on the balance sheet?,"Definition of Accruals
The accrual of expenses and liabilities refers to expenses and/or liabilities that a company has incurred, but the company has not yet paid or recorded the transaction. The accrual of an expense will usually involve an accrual adjusting entry that increases a company's expenses and increases its current liabilities.
The accrual of revenues and assets refers to revenues and/or assets that a company has earned, but the company has not yet received the money nor has it recorded the transaction. The accrual of revenues will usually involve an accrual adjusting entry that increases a company's revenues and increases its current assets.
Example of an Accrual as a Current Liability
Assume that a company has an emergency sewer repair on December 30. The plumbing contractor said the bill will be finalized and mailed to the company on January 10; however, the bill will be approximately $6,000. The company will need to accrue the expense incurred and the related current liability before the December 31 financial statements are prepared. The adjusting entry will debit Repairs Expense for $6,000, and credit Accrued Expenses Payable for $6,000.
Examples of other expenses that usually need an accrual adjusting entry resulting in a current liability include wages, utilities, bonuses, taxes, and interest.
Example of an Accrual as a Current Asset
Assume that during December a company has earned interest of $5,000 on its investment in U.S. Treasury bills. However, the interest will be received by the company on February 15. The company needs to accrue the revenue it earned and the related current asset before the December 31 financial statements are prepared. The adjusting entry will debit Interest Receivable for $5,000, and credit Investment Income for $5,000.

Are retained earnings an asset?,"Definition of Retained Earnings
Usually, retained earnings consists of a corporation's earnings since the corporation was formed minus the amount that was distributed to the stockholders as dividends. In other words, retained earnings is the amount of earnings that the stockholders are leaving in the corporation to be reinvested.
The amount of retained earnings is reported in the stockholders' equity section of the corporation's balance sheet.
Are Retained Earnings an Asset?
While the amount of a corporation's retained earnings is reported in the stockholders' equity section of the balance sheet, the cash that was generated from those retained earnings is not likely be in the company's checking account. Instead, the corporation likely used the cash to acquire additional assets in order to generate additional earnings for its stockholders. In some cases, the corporation will use the cash from the retained earnings to reduce its liabilities. As a result, it is difficult to identify exactly where the retained earnings are presently.
One can get a sense of how the retained earnings have been used by studying the corporation's balance sheet and its statement of cash flows.",what
What is notes receivable?,"Definition of Notes Receivable
Notes receivable is an asset of a company, bank or other organization that holds a written promissory note from another party. (The other party will have a note payable.)
The principal part of a note receivable that is expected to be collected within one year of the balance sheet date is reported in the current asset section of the lender's balance sheet. The remaining principal of the note receivable is reported in the noncurrent asset section entitled Investments.
Examples of Notes Receivable
A company lends one of its important suppliers $10,000 and the supplier gives the company a written promissory note to repay the amount in six months along with interest at 8% per year. The company will debit its current asset account Notes Receivable for the principal amount of $10,000. The credit of $10,000 will be to Cash. 
If a company borrows $100,000 from its bank and signs a promissory note to pay 6% interest quarterly and the principal amount in 9 months, the bank will debit its current asset account Notes Receivable and will credit Cash or Customers' Deposits for the principal amount of $100,000.",what
What is going concern?,"Definition of Going Concern
The going concern assumption is a basic underlying assumption of accounting. For a company to be a going concern, it must be able to continue operating long enough to carry out its commitments, obligations, objectives, and so on. In other words, the company will not have to liquidate or be forced out of business. If there is uncertainty as to a company's ability to meet the going concern assumption, the facts and conditions must be disclosed in its financial statements.
Additional Comments
The going concern assumption provides logic for the cost principle. If a company is a going concern (and therefore liquidation is not relevant), reporting its long term assets at cost is sufficient and there is no need to report the long term assets at their current values or liquidation values? (An exception to cost exists when a long term asset's value has been impaired.)",what
What does current portion of long term debt mean?,"Definition of Current Portion of Long-Term Debt
The current portion of long-term debt is the amount of principal that will be due within one year of the date of the balance sheet. This amount is reported on the balance sheet as one of the company's current liabilities. (A company in an industry where the operating cycle is longer than one year, will report the amount of principal due within the length of the operating cycle as a current liability.)
Example of Current Portion of Long Term Debt
Let's assume that a company has just borrowed $100,000 and signed a note requiring monthly payments of principal and interest for 48 months. Let's also assume that the loan repayment schedule shows that the monthly principal payments for the 12 months after the date of the balance sheet add up to $18,000. The current liability section of the balance sheet will report Current portion of long term debt of $18,000. The remaining amount of principal due at the balance sheet date will be reported as a noncurrent or long-term liability.",what
What is a liquidity ratio?,"Definition of Liquidity Ratio
A liquidity ratio is a financial ratio that indicates whether a company's current assets will be sufficient to meet the company's obligations when they become due.
Examples of Liquidity Ratios
Typically, the following financial ratios are considered to be liquidity ratios:

Current ratio
Quick ratio or acid test ratio

The amount of a company's working capital is also cited as an indicator of liquidity.
However, a company with a large amount of inventory that is difficult to sell may have a large amount of working capital and a favorable current ratio, but may not have liquidity. Hence, the inventory turnover ratio and the accounts receivable turnover ratio can provide insights as to a company's ability to convert its current assets to cash in time to pay its obligations when they become due.",what
What is a capital account?,"Definition of Capital Account
In accounting and bookkeeping, a capital account is a general ledger account that is part of the balance sheet classification:

Owner's equity (in a sole proprietorship)
Stockholders' equity (in a corporation)

Examples of Capital Accounts
The sole proprietorship of J. Lee will include the following capital accounts:

J. Lee, Capital, which is increased by J. Lee's investment into the business plus each accounting period's net income, and which is decreased by the debit balance in the account J. Lee, Drawing
J. Lee, Drawing, which is a temporary account that records the proprietor's draws during the year. At the end of the year, the account's debit balance will be closed to owner's capital account

A corporation will likely have the following capital accounts:

Paid-in capital accounts such as Common Stock, Preferred Stock, Paid-in Capital in Excess of Par, which are used to record the amounts received by the corporation when shares of its capital stock were originally issued to investors.
The account Retained Earnings which consists of the amount of the corporation's earnings since the corporation was formed minus the dividends distributed to the stockholders since the corporation was formed.
The account Treasury Stock, which has a debit balance representing the amount paid by the corporation to repurchase its own shares of stock which it did not retire.

Other Information on Capital Accounts
The total of the balances in all of the capital accounts must be equal to the reported total of the company's assets minus its liabilities. Because of the historical cost principle and other accounting principles, the total amount reported in the capital accounts will not indicate a company's market value.",what
Where is a contingent liability recorded?,"Recording a Contingent Liability
A potential or contingent liability that is both probable and the amount can be estimated is recorded as 1) an expense or loss on the income statement, and 2) a liability on the balance sheet. 
Disclosing a Contingent Liability
A loss contingency which is possible but not probable will not be recorded in the accounts as a liability and a loss. Rather, it will be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
A loss contingency that is probable or possible but the amount cannot be estimated means the amount cannot be recorded in the company's accounts or reported as liability on the balance sheet. Instead, the contingent liability will be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. 
Not Reporting or Disclosing a Contingent Liability
A loss contingency that is remote  will not be recorded and it will not have to be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. An example is a nuisance lawsuit where there is no similar case that was ever successful.
Example of Recording a Contingent Liability
Product warranties are often cited as a contingent liability that meets both of the required conditions (probable and the amount can be estimated). Product warranties will be recorded at the time of the products' sales by debiting Warranty Expense and crediting to Warranty Liability for the estimated amount.",what
How is a short term bank loan recorded?,"Definition of Short Term Bank Loan
When a company borrows money from its bank and agrees to repay the loan amount within a year, the company will record the loan by increasing its cash and increasing a current liability such as Notes Payable or Loans Payable. The bank will record the loan by increasing a current asset such as Loans to Customers or Loans Receivable and increasing a current liability such as Customer Demand Deposits.
Example of a Company Recording a Loan from a Bank
Let's assume that a company obtains a $30,000 bank loan that must be repaid within 9 months. The bank deposits the loan proceeds of $30,000 into the company's checking account at the same bank.
The double entry to be recorded by the company is: 1) a debit of $30,000 to the company's current asset account Cash for the amount that the bank deposited into the company's checking account, and 2) a credit of $30,000 to the company's current liability account Notes Payable (or Loans Payable) for the amount of principal that it must repay to the bank. (If there is a difference between the two amounts, it may pertain to bank fees or prepaid interest that will also have to be recorded.)
Example of a Bank Recording a Loan to a Customer
The double entry to be recorded by the bank is: 1) a debit to the bank's current asset account Loans to Customers or Loans Receivable for the principal amount it expects to collect, and 2) a credit to the bank's current liability account Customer Demand Deposits. (If there is a difference between the two amounts, it may pertain to bank fees or prepaid interest that will also have to be recorded.)",what
What is the operating cycle?,"Operating cycle definition
The operating cycle is the time required for a company's cash to be put into its operations and then return to the company's cash account.
Operating cycle example
A manufacturer's operating cycle is amount of time required for the manufacturer's cash to be used to:

pay for the raw materials needed in its products
pay for the labor and overhead costs needed to convert the raw materials into products
hold the finished products in inventory until they are sold
wait for the customers' cash payments to be collected

The operating cycle is the sum of the following:

the days' sales in inventory (365 days/inventory turnover ratio), plus
the average collection period (365 days/accounts receivable turnover ratio)

The operating cycle has importance in classifying current assets and current liabilities. While most manufacturers have operating cycles of several months, a few industries require very long processing times. This could result in an operating cycle that is longer than one year. To accommodate those industries, the accountants' definitions of current assets and current liabilities include the following phrase: ...within one year or within the operating cycle, whichever is longer.

What is capitalized interest?,"Capitalized interest is the interest added to the cost of a self-constructed, long-term asset. It involves the interest on debt used to finance the asset's construction.
The details of capitalized interest are explained in the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 34, Capitalization of Interest Cost. You can find this accounting pronouncement at www.FASB.org/st.
In short, there must be debt involved (cash and common stock are not considered). The interest specified by the pronouncement is added to the cost of the project, instead of being expensed on the current period's income statement. This capitalized interest will be part of the asset's cost reported on the balance sheet, and will be part of the asset's depreciation expense that will be reported in future income statements.",what
Is the provision for doubtful debts an operating expense?,"Definition of Provision for Doubtful Debts
Some companies use Provision for Doubtful Debts as the name of the contra-asset account which is reported on the company's balance sheet. Other companies use Provision for Doubtful Debts as the name for the current period's expense that is reported on the company's income statement.
If Provision for Doubtful Debts is the name of the account used for recording the current period's expense associated with the losses from normal credit sales, it will appear as an operating expense on the company's income statement. It may be included in the company's selling, general and administrative expenses.
[However, if the expense is associated with extending credit outside of a company's main selling activities, the credit loss will be reported as a nonoperating expense.]
Example of Provision for Doubtful Debts
Accounting textbooks avoid the use of the word ""provision"" and instead use the following terminology:

The contra-asset account associated with accounts receivable will have the account title Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.
The current period expense pertaining to accounts receivable (and its contra account) is recorded in the account Bad Debts Expense which is reported on the income statement as part of the operating expenses.",what
What is accrued interest?,"Definition of Accrued Interest
Accrued interest is the amount of loan interest that has already occurred, but has not yet been paid by the borrower and not yet received by the lender.
Under the accrual basis of accounting, the amount of accrued interest is to be recorded with accrual adjusting entries by the borrower and the lender before issuing their financial statements.
The borrower's adjusting entry will debit Interest Expense and credit Accrued Interest Payable (a current liability). The lender's adjusting entry will debit Accrued Interest Receivable (a current asset) and credit Interest Revenue (or Income).
Example of Accrued Interest
Let's assume that on December 16, a company borrows $20,000 from its bank at an annual interest rate of 6%. The first interest payment is due 30 days later on January 15. Both the company and the bank have accounting years which end on December 31.
The accrued interest as of December 31 is $50 ($20,000 X 6% = $1,200 per year = $100 per month = $50 for 1/2 month).
The company's adjusting entry will debit Interest Expense for $50, and will credit Accrued Interest Payable for $50.
The bank's adjusting entry will debit Accrued Interest Receivable for $50, and will credit Interest Revenue for $50.",what
Is a security deposit for a rental agreement recorded in a liability account?,"The person paying the security deposit would credit the asset account Cash and would debit the asset account Security Deposits. The person receiving the security deposit would debit the asset account Cash and would credit the liability account Security Deposits Returnable.
Let's use an example. Monica pays the landlord $500 as a security deposit as required by the lease for the apartment she is renting. If she causes no damage, she has a right to the $500 at the end of the lease. She gave up an asset (Cash of $500) but has another asset: the right to $500 at the end of the lease. The landlord receives the $500, but has an obligation to return the security deposit at the end of the lease. The landlord received an asset (Cash of $500) but has a liability to return the $500 at the end of the lease (unless there are damages).
As the example showed, a security deposit is an asset for one party and the same security deposit is a liability for the other party.",what
What is the difference between assets and fixed assets?,"Assets are resources owned by a company as the result of transactions. Examples of assets are cash, accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid insurance, land, buildings, equipment, trademarks and customer lists purchased from another company, and certain deferred charges.
The term fixed assets generally refers to the long-term assets, tangible assets used in a business that are classified as property, plant and equipment. Examples of fixed assets are land, buildings, manufacturing equipment, office equipment, furniture, fixtures, and vehicles. Except for land, the fixed assets are depreciated over their useful lives.",what
Where does the purchase of equipment show up on a profit and loss statement?,"Reporting the Purchase of Equipment
Assuming that the purchase of equipment is a long-term or noncurrent asset that will be used in a business, the purchase will not  be reported on the profit and loss statement (income statement, statement of earnings). Rather, the equipment's cost will be reported in the general ledger account Equipment, which is reported on the balance sheet under the classification Property, plant and equipment. The purchase will also be included in the company's capital expenditures that are reported on the statement of cash flows in the section entitled cash flows from investing activities.
When the equipment is placed into service, the company will begin to report depreciation expense on the profit and loss statements during the years that the equipment is used.
Example of Equipment's Cost on Income Statement
Let's assume that a company buys equipment for $100,000 and it is expected to be used for 10 years with no salvage value at the end of its useful life. Using the straight-line method of depreciation, each year's profit and loss statement will report depreciation expense of $10,000 for 10 years. Each year the account Accumulated Depreciation will be credited for the $10,000 of annual depreciation.",what
How do drawings affect the financial statements?,"Definition of Drawings
Drawings are the withdrawals of a sole proprietorship's business assets by the owner for the owner's personal use.
The drawings or draws by the owner (L. Webb) are recorded in an owner's equity account such as L. Webb, Drawings; L. Webb, Draws; or L. Webb, Withdrawals. The other part of the entry will reduce the specific business asset.
Example of Drawings
If the owner (L. Webb) draws $5,000 of cash from her business, the accounting entry will be a debit of $5,000 to the account L. Webb, Drawings and a credit of $5,000 to the account Cash.
Effect of Drawings on the Financial Statements
The owner's drawings will affect the company's balance sheet by decreasing the asset that is withdrawn and by the decrease in owner's equity.
The owner's drawings of cash will also affect the financing activities section of the statement of cash flows. (If an asset other than cash is withdrawn, it is reported as supplemental information on the statement of cash flows.)
The income statement is not affected by the owner's drawings since the drawings are not business expenses.",what
What is par value?,"Definition of Par Value
Par value is a per share amount that will appear on some stock certificates and in the corporation's articles of incorporation. (Some states may require a corporation to have a par value while others states do not require a par value.) (Par value can also refer to an amount that appears on bond certificates.)
In the case of common stock the par value per share is usually a very small amount such as $0.10 or $0.01 and it has no connection to the market value of the share of stock. The par value is sometimes referred to as the common stock's legal capital. When a corporation's common or preferred stock has a par value, corporation's balance sheet will report the total par value of the shares issued for each class of stock. This will be shown as a separate amount in the paid-in capital or contributed capital section of stockholders' equity.
Example of Par Value
Let's assume that a share of common stock has a par value of $0.01 and is sold to an investor for $25. The corporation issuing the stock will debit Cash for $25.00 and will credit Common Stock for $0.01 and will credit Additional Paid-in Capital for $24.99.",what
What is stockholders' equity?,"Definition of Stockholders' Equity
Stockholders' equity (also known as shareholders' equity) is reported on a corporation's balance sheet and its amount is the difference between the amount of the corporation's assets and its liabilities.
Generally, stockholders' equity consists of the amounts the corporation had received from the sale of its common and preferred shares of stock plus the earnings of the corporation minus any distributions to the stockholders. In other words, stockholders' equity is one source of the corporation's assets. (The other source are the corporation's creditors as evidenced by the liabilities.) 
Stockholders' equity and liabilities are also seen as the claims to the corporation's assets. However, the stockholders' claim comes after the liabilities have been paid.
Stockholders' equity is also the corporation's total book value (which is different from the corporation's worth or market value).
Components of Stockholders' Equity
The amount of stockholders' equity is reported on the balance sheet as follows:

Paid-in capital. This is the amount that the corporation received when it issued shares of its capital stock with common stock and preferred stock (if any) reported separately.
Retained earnings. Generally this is the cumulative earnings of the corporation minus the cumulative amount of dividends declared.
Accumulated other comprehensive income. This is the cumulative amount of income (or loss) for a few items that are not reported on the corporation's income statement.
Treasury stock. This is a reduction of stockholders' equity for the amount the corporation paid to purchase but not retire its own shares of capital stock.

The changes which occurred in stockholders' equity during the accounting period are reported in the corporation's statement of stockholders' equity.",what
Where should I enter unpaid wages?,"Definition of Unpaid Wages
Unpaid wages are usually the amounts that hourly-paid employees have earned, but have not yet been paid to the employees. 
Entering Unpaid Wages
Under the accrual basis of accounting, unpaid wages that have been earned by employees but have not yet been recorded in the accounting records should be entered or recorded through an accrual adjusting entry which will:

Debit Wages Expense
Credit Wages Payable or credit Accrued Wages Payable

Wages Expense is an income statement account. Wages Payable or Accrued Wages Payable is a current liability account that is reported on the balance sheet.",what
What is inventory?,"Definition of Inventory
Inventory is a very significant current asset for retailers, distributors, and manufacturers. Inventory serves as a buffer between 1) a company's sales of goods, and 2) its purchases or production of goods.
Companies strive to find the proper amount of inventory so that it can meet the fluctuating demand of its customers, avoid disruptions in production, and minimize holding costs.
Since the costs of the items purchased or produced are likely to change (especially with inflation), companies must elect a cost flow assumption for valuing its inventory and its cost of goods sold. In the U.S. the common cost flow assumptions are FIFO, LIFO, and average.
A company's cost of inventory is related to the company's cost of goods sold that is reported on the company's income statement.
Examples of Inventories
Retailers and distributors are likely to have one type of inventory, namely merchandise.
Manufacturers will have three or four categories of inventories:

Raw materials
Work-in-process
Finished goods
Manufacturing and packaging supplies

Manufacturers are required to report the amounts of each inventory category on its balance sheet or in the notes to the financial statements.",what
Would you please explain unearned income?,"Definition of Unearned Income
Unearned income or deferred income is a receipt of money before it has been earned. This is also referred to as deferred revenues or customer deposits. The unearned amount is initially recorded in a liability account such as Deferred Income, Deferred Revenues, or Customer Deposits. As the amount is earned, the liability account is reduced and the amount earned will be reported on the income statement as revenues.
Example #1 of Unearned Income
A lawn service company offers customers a special package of five applications of fertilizers and weed treatments for $300. However, the customer must prepay in December for the five treatments that will be done between April and September. When the company receives the $300 in December, it will debit the asset Cash for $300 and will credit the liability account Unearned Revenues. Since these are balance sheet accounts (and since no work has yet been performed), there are no revenues to be reported in December. In April when the first service is provided, the company will debit the liability account Unearned Revenues for $60 and will credit the income statement account Service Revenues for $60. At the end of April, the balance sheet will report the company's remaining liability of $240. The income statement for April will report the $60 that was earned. The $60 entry is referred to as an adjusting entry and the same entry will be recorded when each of the remaining four treatments are provided.
Example #2 of Unearned Income
A company informs a new customer that a $5,000 deposit is required before it will begin work on the customer's special order. The customer gives the company $5,000 on December 28 and the company will begin work on the special order on January 3. On December 28 the company will debit Cash for $5,000 and will credit a liability account, such as Customer Deposits (or Unearned Revenues or Deferred Revenues) for $5,000. No revenue is reported in December for this special order since the company did not perform any work in December. When the special order begins and is completed in January, the company will debit the liability account for $5,000 and will credit a revenue account.",what
What is a revenue expenditure?,"Definition of Revenue Expenditure
A revenue expenditure is a cost that will be an expense in the accounting period when the expenditure takes place.
Revenue expenditures are often discussed in the context of fixed assets. The revenue expenditures take place after a fixed asset had been put into service and simply keeps the asset in working order. (The amount spent to acquire a fixed asset is referred to as a capital expenditure. The amount of the capital expenditure will be recorded as an asset and will then be moved to the income statement as depreciation expense over the years of the asset's useful life.)
Example of Revenue Expenditure
Let's assume that a company made a capital expenditure of $100,000 to install a high efficiency machine. The new machine requires routine maintenance of $3,000 each month. This $3,000 is a revenue expenditure since it will be reported on the monthly income statement, thereby being matched with the month's revenues. Normal repairs to the machine are also a revenue expenditure, since the expenditure does not make the machine more than it was, nor does it extend the machine's useful life. As a result, normal repairs will also be reported on the income statement as an expense in the accounting period when the repair is made.",what
What is the expanded accounting equation?,"Definition of Expanded Accounting Equation
The expanded accounting equation provides more details for the owner's equity amount shown in the basic accounting equation. The expanded accounting equation for a sole proprietorship is: Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Capital + Revenues – Expenses – Owner's Draws.
The expanded accounting equation for a corporation provides more details for the stockholders' equity amount shown in the basic accounting equation. The expanded accounting equation for a corporation is: Assets = Liabilities + Paid-in Capital + Revenues – Expenses – Dividends – Treasury Stock.
The expanded accounting equation allows you to see separately (1) the impact on equity from net income (increased by revenues, decreased by expenses), and (2) the effect of transactions with owners (draws, dividends, sale or purchase of ownership interest).",what
Where is the premium or discount on bonds payable presented on the balance sheet?,"Definition of Premium or Discount on Bonds Payable
The premium or discount on bonds payable is the difference between the amount received by the corporation issuing the bonds and the par value or face amount of the bonds. If the amount received is greater than the par value, the difference is known as the premium on bonds payable. If the amount received is less than the par value, the difference is known as the discount on bonds payable.
The premium and discount accounts are viewed as valuation accounts. The unamortized premium on bonds payable will have a credit balance that increases the carrying amount (or the book value) of the bonds payable. The unamortized discount on bonds payable will have a debit balance and that decreases the carrying amount (or book value) of the bonds payable.
The premium or discount is to be amortized to interest expense over the life of the bonds. Hence, the balance in the premium or discount account is the unamortized balance.
Where the Premium or Discount on Bonds Payable is Presented
The premium or the discount on bonds payable that has not yet been amortized to interest expense will be reported immediately after the par value of the bonds in the liabilities section of the balance sheet. Generally, if the bonds are not maturing within one year of the balance sheet date, the amounts will be reported in the long-term or noncurrent liabilities section of the balance sheet.",what
What are goods in transit?,"Definition of Goods in Transit
Goods in transit refers to inventory items and other products that have been shipped by a seller, but have not yet reached the purchaser.
When goods are in transit at the end of an accounting period, they require special accounting attention since the goods are not physically present at either the seller's or the buyer's location. It is necessary to examine whether the sales terms were FOB shipping point or FOB destination. The rules to be followed are:

If the terms are FOB shipping point, the goods in transit are the property of the buyer
If the terms are FOB destination, the goods in transit are the property of the seller

Example of Goods in Transit
Let's assume that both a company (seller) and its customer (buyer) have accounting periods which end on December 31. The company ships a truckload of merchandise on December 30 to a customer who is located 2,000 miles away. The merchandise arrives at the customer's location on January 2. Between December 30 and January 2, the merchandise is an example of goods in transit. 
If the terms are FOB shipping point, the company (seller) will record a sale and receivable as of December 30, and will not include the goods in transit as its December 31 inventory. On December 31, the customer (buyer) is the owner of the goods in transit and will need to report a purchase, a payable, and must include the cost of the goods in transit in its inventory cost.
If the terms of the sale are FOB destination, the company (seller) will not have a sale and receivable until January 2. This means the company (seller) must include the cost of the goods in transit in its inventory as of December 31. [The customer (buyer) will not have a purchase, payable, or inventory of the goods as of December 31. The customer's (buyer's) purchase, payable, and increase in inventory will occur on January 2.]",what
What is the difference between depreciation expense and accumulated depreciation?,"Definition of Depreciation Expense
Depreciation expense is the amount of depreciation that is reported on the income statement. In other words, it is the amount of an asset's cost that has been allocated and reported as an expense for the period (year, month, etc.) shown in the income statement's heading.
Definition of Accumulated Depreciation
Accumulated depreciation reports the total amount of depreciation that has been reported on all of the income statements from the time that the assets were put into service until the date of the balance sheet. The account Accumulated Depreciation is a contra asset account because it will have a credit balance. The credit balance is reported in the property, plant and equipment section of the balance sheet and it reduces the cost of the assets to their carrying value or book value.
Example of Depreciation Expense and Accumulated Depreciation
To illustrate, let's assume that a retailer purchases new display racks at a cost of $84,000. This asset is estimated to have a useful life of 7 years (84 months) and no salvage value at the end of 7 years. Assuming the retailer uses the straight-line depreciation method, during each month of the display racks' lives the retailer's monthly income statement will report depreciation expense of $1,000. However, the credit balance in Accumulated Depreciation will be reported on the balance sheet at $1,000 at the end of the first month, $2,000 at the end of the second month, $3,000 at the end of the third month, etc. until the balance in Accumulated Depreciation reaches $84,000 at the end of the 84th month.",what
What is a plant asset?,"What is a Plant Asset
A plant asset is an asset with a useful life of more than one year that is used in producing revenues in a business's operations. Plant assets are also known as fixed assets.
Plant assets are recorded at their cost and depreciation expense is recorded during their useful lives.
Plant assets (other than land) are depreciated over their useful lives and each year's depreciation is credited to a contra asset account Accumulated Depreciation.
Plant assets and the related accumulated depreciation are reported on a company's balance sheet in the noncurrent asset section entitled property, plant and equipment. Accounting rules also require that the plant assets be reviewed for possible impairment losses.
Examples of Plant Assets
Plant assets include:

Land (not depreciated)
Land improvements
Buildings
Machinery and equipment

What is book value?,"Definition of Book Value
In accounting, book value refers to the amounts contained in the company's general ledger accounts (or books). It is important to realize that the book value is not the same as the fair market value because of the accountants' historical cost principle and matching principle.
Book value of an asset is: the asset's cost minus the asset's accumulated depreciation. 
Book value of the liability Bonds Payable is the combination of the following:

Maturity or par value of the bonds reported as a credit balance in Bonds Payable
Unamortized discount reported as a debit balance in Discount on Bonds Payable
Unamortized issue costs reported as a debit balance in Bond Issue Costs
Unamortized premium reported as a credit balance in Premium on Bonds Payable

Book value of a corporation is: the total amount of stockholders' equity appearing on a corporation's balance sheet. 
Examples of Book Value Calculations
If a company's computer system had a cost of $300,000 and it has accumulated depreciation of $80,000, the computer system has a book value of $220,000. 
If a company has issued bonds with a maturity value of $40,000,000 and its current balance sheet reports Unamortized Bond Discount of $800,000 and Unamortized Bond Issue Costs of $200,000, the book value of the bonds is $39,000,000.
If a corporation's balance sheet reports stockholders' equity of $245,000, the corporation's book value is that amount.
Reminder Concerning Book Value
Book value does not indicate the current market value. In our examples:

The current market value of the computer system may be far less than the book value of $220,000
The current market value of the corporation may be far more than its book value of $245,000",what
What are the effects of depreciation?,"Definition of Depreciation
Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the cost of a company's assets used in its business from the balance sheet to the income statement (as an expense) over their estimated useful lives.
Depreciation occurs through an accounting adjusting entry in which the account Depreciation Expense is debited and the contra asset account Accumulated Depreciation is credited.
Effects of Depreciation
The following are some of the effects for a corporation that is depreciating assets:

The net income, retained earnings, and stockholders' equity are reduced with the debit to Depreciation Expense
The carrying value of the assets being depreciated and amount of total assets are reduced by the credit to Accumulated Depreciation
The depreciation expense reported on the U.S. income tax return (based on the tax regulations) reduces a corporation's taxable income (and its related income tax payments).",what
What is the difference between receivables and accounts receivable?,"Definition of Accounts Receivables
Accounts receivable are usually current assets that result from selling goods or providing services to customers on credit. Accounts receivable are also known as trade receivables.
Definition of Receivables
The term receivables sometimes refers to a company's accounts receivables. However, the term receivables could include both trade receivables and nontrade receivables.
Nontrade receivables exclude accounts receivable and may appear on the balance sheet as other receivables.
Examples of Nontrade Receivables
Some examples of nontrade or other receivables include:

Interest receivable
Income tax receivable
Insurance claims receivable
Receivables from employees",what
What is the difference between interest expense and interest payable?,"Definition of Interest Expense
Assuming the accrual method of accounting, interest expense is the amount of interest that was incurred on debt during a period of time. Interest Expense is also the title of the income statement account that is used to record the interest incurred. Lastly, interest expense is usually a separate line on a company's income statement that indicates the amount that occurred during the period appearing in the heading of the income statement.
Definition of Interest Payable
Interest payable is the amount of interest the company has incurred but has not yet paid as of the date of the balance sheet. Interest Payable is also the title of the current liability account that is used to record and report this amount.
Examples of Interest Expense and Interest Payable
To illustrate the difference between interest expense and interest payable, let's assume that a company borrows $200,000 on November 1 at an annual interest rate of 6%. The company is required to pay each month's interest on the 15th day of the following month. Therefore, the November interest of $1,000 ($200,000 x 6% x 1/12) is to be paid on December 15. The $1,000 of interest incurred during December is to be paid on January 15. Therefore, as of December 31, the company's current liability account Interest Payable must report $1,000 for December's interest. For the two-month period, the company will report Interest Expense of $2,000 (November's and December's interest of $1,000 each month).",what
How should a mortgage loan payable be reported on a classified balance sheet?,"Definition of a Mortgage Loan Payable
The account Mortgage Loan Payable contains the principal amount owed on a mortgage loan. (Any interest that has accrued since the last payment should be reported as Interest Payable, a current liability. Future interest is not reported on the balance sheet.)
Any principal that is to be paid within 12 months of the balance sheet date is reported as a current liability. The remaining amount of principal is reported as a long-term liability (or noncurrent liability).
Example of a Mortgage Loan Payable
Let's assume that a company has a mortgage loan payable of $238,000 and is required to make monthly payments of approximately $4,500 per month. Each of the monthly payments includes a $3,000 principal payment plus an interest payment of approximately $1,500. This means that during the next 12 months, the company will be required to repay $36,000 ($3,000 x 12 months) of the loan's principal. Therefore $36,000 is reported as a current liability. The remaining principal of $202,000 ($238,000 minus $36,000) is reported as a long-term (or noncurrent) liability since this amount will not be due within one year of the balance sheet date.
You can find the amount of principal due within the next year by reviewing the loan's amortization schedule or by asking your lender.",what
What is window dressing?,"Definition of Window Dressing
Window dressing refers to actions taken or not taken prior to issuing financial statements in order to improve the appearance of the financial statements.
Example of Window Dressing
Let's assume that a company operates throughout the year with a negative balance in its general ledger account Cash: Checking Account. (At the bank, the checking account has a positive balance due to the time it takes for the company's checks to clear.) In order to avoid its December 31 balance sheet reporting a negative cash balance, the company decides to postpone issuing checks for vendors' invoices that should have been paid. The postponement allows its general ledger Cash account to temporarily have a positive amount. On January 2, the company will issue the postponed checks and will resume its normal practice of having a negative balance in its Cash account.",what
What is comprehensive income?,"Definition of Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive income for a corporation is the combination of the following amounts which occurred during a specified period of time such as a year, quarter, month, etc.:

Net income or net loss (the details of which are reported on the corporation's income statement), plus
Other comprehensive income (if any)

Examples of other comprehensive income include:

Unrealized gains/losses on hedging derivatives
Foreign currency translation adjustments
Unrealized gains/losses on postretirement benefit plans

Basically, comprehensive income consists of all of the revenues, gains, expenses, and losses that caused stockholders' equity to change during the accounting period.
The amount of net income for the period is added to retained earnings, while the amount of other comprehensive income is added to accumulated other comprehensive income. Retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income are reported on separate lines within stockholders' equity on the end-of-the-period balance sheet.",what
What is a fiscal year?,"Definition of Fiscal Year
A fiscal year is an accounting year that does not end on December 31. (Accounting years of January 1 through December 31 are known as calendar years.)
A fiscal year could be a 12-month period of time or a 52/53-week period of time.
One reason a U.S. business or other organization will have its accounting year end on a date other than December 31 is to coincide with its natural business year.
When an organization's fiscal year ends outside of the CPAs' busy season, the organization may be able to negotiate a lower auditing fee.
Examples of Fiscal Years
A few examples of fiscal years include:

12 months of February 1 through January 31
12 months of October 1 through September 30
12 months of June 1 through May 31
52 weeks ending on the Saturday closest to January 31. (Since 52 weeks X 7 days = 364 days vs. 365 days per year, there will be an occasional 53-week year)

School districts typically have fiscal years of July 1 through June 30 to coincide with its natural business year. Large retailers often end their fiscal years on the Saturday closest to January 31 in order to include sales returns from its peak December sales. The retailers' interim periods will be 13-week ""quarters"" consisting of one 5-week ""month"" plus two 4-week ""months"". This allows for better comparisons between years.",what
Why is there a difference in the amounts for Bad Debts Expense and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts?,"Amount Reported as Bad Debts Expense
The amount reported in the income statement account Bad Debts Expense pertains to the estimated losses from extending credit during the period shown in the heading of the income statement. The estimated amount of Bad Debts Expense could be based on:

A percentage of the company's credit sales during the period, or
The change in the total amount needed in the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts based upon the amounts customers owe on the company's accounts receivable
Amount Reported as Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
The balance reported in the balance sheet account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is the estimated amount of Accounts Receivable that will not be collected. The balance in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts could be based upon:

An aging of the detailed amounts in Accounts Receivable
The result of recording the credit part of the entries to Bad Debts Expense that were based on a percentage of credit sales

Example of Bad Debts Expense and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
To illustrate, let's assume that on December 31 a company had $100,000 in Accounts Receivable and its balance in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts was a credit balance of $3,000. As a result, the December 31 balance sheet will be reporting that $97,000 will be turning to cash. During the first 30 days of January the company does not have any other information on bad accounts receivable. However, on January 31 the company learns that an additional $1,000 of its accounts receivable may not be collected. Therefore, on January 31 the company will make an adjusting entry to debit Bad Debts Expense for $1,000 and to credit Allowance for Doubtful Accounts for $1,000. After this entry is recorded, the company's income statement for the month of January will report Bad Debts Expense of $1,000 and its January 31 balance sheet will report a credit balance in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts in the amount of $4,000.",what
What is accrued income?,"Definition of Accrued Income
Accrued income is an amount that:

A company has earned
The company has a right to receive
The collection is probable
Has not yet been recorded in the general ledger accounts

Under the accrual basis of accounting, accrued income is recorded with an accrual adjusting entry prior to issuing the financial statements.
Example of Accrued Income
One example of accrued income is the interest a company earns on a bond investment. To illustrate, let's assume that a company invested $100,000 on December 1 in a 6% $100,000 bond that pays $3,000 of interest on each June 1 and December 1. On December 31, the company will have earned one month's interest amounting to $500 ($100,000 x 6% per year x 1/12 of a year, or 1/6 of the semiannual $3,000). No interest will be received in December since it will be included in the $3,000 interest that will be received on June 1. The $500 of interest that has been earned during December, but not yet received nor previously recorded as of December 31, is accrued interest income.
The accrued interest income will be recorded with an accrual adjusting entry dated December 31 that debits Interest Receivable (a balance sheet account) for $500, and credits Interest Income (an income statement account) for $500.",what
What is the aging method?,"Definition of Aging Method
The aging method usually refers to the technique for estimating the amount of a company's accounts receivable that will not be collected. The estimated amount that will not be collected should be the credit balance in the contra asset account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. The debit balance in Accounts Receivable minus the credit balance in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts will result in the estimated amount of the receivables that will be converted to cash.
The aging method sorts each customer's unpaid invoices by invoice date into perhaps four columns:

Column 1 lists the invoice amounts that are not yet due
Column 2 lists the invoice amounts that are 1-30 days past due
Column 3 lists the invoice amounts that are 31-60 days past due
Column 4 lists the invoice amounts that are more than 61 days past due

Accounting software will likely have a feature that generates the aging of accounts receivable.
Example of Aging Method
Let's assume that a company's Accounts Receivable has a debit balance of $89,400. The aging method indicates that most of the customers are current. However, there are a few customers' invoices that are more than 60 days past due. Those past due accounts are reviewed closely and based on each customer's information it is estimated that approximately $7,400 of the $89,400 will not be collected. Therefore the credit balance in the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts must be $7,400. This will result in the balance sheet reporting Accounts Receivable (Net) of $82,000.",what
What is meant by owner's draws?,"Definition of Owner's Draws
Owner's draws are withdrawals of a sole proprietorship's cash or other assets made by the owner for the owner's personal use. The account in which the draws are recorded is a contra owner's capital account or contra owner's equity account since its debit balance is contrary to the normal credit balance of the owner's equity or capital account.
The title of the account for recording R. Smith's draws from his or her business is R. Smith, Drawing or R. Smith, Withdrawals. This account is a temporary account because its balance will be closed at the end of each year. However, the account's debit balance is closed directly to the owner's capital account. (The owner's draws are not reported as an expense on the company's income statement.) 
Example of Owner's Draws
Let's assume that R. Smith, the owner of a sole proprietorship, withdraws $2,000 each month for the owner's household expenses. The company's entry to record each month's draws will be:

A debit to R. Smith, Drawing (an owner's equity account with a debit balance)
A credit to Cash",what
What is a LIFO Reserve?,"Definition of LIFO Reserve
The LIFO reserve is a contra inventory account that indicates the difference between the following:

Inventory cost reported on the balance sheet under the LIFO cost flow assumption
Inventory cost under the FIFO cost flow assumption

The credit balance in the LIFO reserve reports the difference since the time that LIFO was adopted. The change in the balance during the current year represents the current year's impact on the cost of goods sold.
The disclosure of the LIFO reserve allows readers to better compare the financial statements of a company using LIFO with the financial statements of a company using FIFO. Since the accounting profession has discouraged the use of the word ""reserve"", the inventory notes in the financial statements have descriptions such as Revaluation to LIFO, Excess of FIFO over LIFO cost, and LIFO allowance instead of LIFO reserve.
Example of LIFO Reserve
A U.S. company's accounting system uses FIFO, but the company wants its financial and income tax reporting to use LIFO due to the persistent increases in the cost of its inventory items. LIFO will result in the most recent higher costs being reported in the cost of goods sold resulting in less gross profit, less net income, less taxable income, and less income taxes than FIFO. LIFO also means that the older lower costs remain in inventory.
With consistently increasing costs (and stable or increasing quantities of inventory items) the balance in the LIFO reserve account will be an ever-increasing credit balance that reduces the company's FIFO inventory cost.",what
What is the difference between a deferred expense and a prepaid expense?,"Definition of Deferred Expense and Prepaid Expense
Deferred expense and prepaid expense both refer to a payment that was made, but due to the matching principle, the amount will not become an expense until one or more future accounting periods. Most of these payments will be recorded as assets until the appropriate future period or periods. Sometimes these amounts are referred to as prepayments.
Before a balance sheet is prepared, the accountant must review the deferrals/prepaids and move the appropriate amounts to expense.
Difference between Deferred Expense and Prepaid Expense
It appears that most accountants refer to the deferrals that will become expenses within one year of the balance sheet as prepaid expenses. The amount that has not been expensed as of the balance sheet date will be reported as a current asset.
The deferred expenses that will not become expenses within one year of the date of the balance sheet will be reported in the long-term asset section of the balance sheet under the classification of other assets. (An exception is the costs of issuing long-term bonds. This amount is reported on the balance sheet as a contra liability account along with Bonds Payable in the long-term liability section.)",what
Is a prepaid expense recorded initially as an expense?,"Definition of Prepaid Expense
A prepaid expense refers to an amount that a company has paid and a portion or all of it will be an expense in a later accounting period.
Example of a Prepaid Expense
A company with an accounting year ending on December 31 has a prepaid expense if on December 1, it paid $6,000 for insurance coverage from December 1 through May 31.
Recording a Prepaid Expense
A prepaid expense can be recorded initially as an expense or as a current asset. Either way, adjusting entries will be needed during the six months to be certain that:

The current month's insurance expense of $1,000 ($6,000/6 months) is reported on each month's income statement.
The unexpired amount of the prepaid insurance is reported on the balance sheet as of the last day of each month. For example, on December 31 the balance sheet must report $5,000. On January 31 the balance sheet must report $4,000, and so on.",what
What is the effect on the income statement when the allowance for uncollectible accounts is not established?,"Definition of Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts
The Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts or Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is a contra asset account that reduces the amount of accounts receivable to the amount that is more likely be collected.
The income statement account Bad Debts Expense is part of the adjusting entry that increases the balance in the Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts.
Effect of No Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts
If a company's balance sheet does not reduce its accounts receivable debit balance with a credit balance in Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts, the company is communicating that it is not anticipating any bad debts expense relating to its existing accounts receivable. Hence, the income statement is delaying the reporting of bad debts expense on its income statement until an account receivable is actually written off as uncollectible.",what
What is the acid test ratio?,"Definition of Acid Test Ratio
The acid test ratio, which is also known as the quick ratio, compares the total of a company's cash, temporary marketable securities, and accounts receivable to the total amount of the company's current liabilities.
The acid test ratio is considered to be a better indicator of a company's ability to meet its current obligations than the current ratio because inventories and prepaid expenses are not included.
Example of Acid Test Ratio
Let's illustrate the acid test ratio by assuming that a company has cash of $7,000 + temporary marketable securities of $20,000 + accounts receivables of $93,000. This adds up to $120,000 of quick assets. If the company's current liabilities amount to $100,000 the acid test ratio is 1.2:1.
A large acid test ratio gives creditors confidence that the company will be able to meet its current obligations when they come due.",what
What is a long-term asset?,"Definition of Long-term Asset
A long-term asset is an asset that is not expected to be converted to cash or be consumed within one year of the date shown in the heading of the balance sheet. (If a company has an operating cycle that is longer than one year, a long-term asset is not expected to turn to cash within the operating cycle.) Expressed another way, a long-term asset is an asset that does not meet the criteria of being reported as a current asset. Hence, long-term assets are also known as noncurrent assets or long-lived assets. 
Examples of Long-term Assets
Long-term assets include the following:

Long-term investments. These include some investments in stocks and bonds of other corporations, a company's bond sinking fund, the cash surrender value of life insurance policies owned by the company, real estate awaiting to be sold, etc.
Property, plant and equipment. This classification includes land, buildings, machinery, equipment, vehicles, fixtures, etc. that are used in the business. These assets are reported at cost and the contra asset accumulated depreciation is also included.
Intangible assets. These include trademarks, patents, customer lists, goodwill, etc. that were acquired in a transaction.
Deferred charges. This category is used for items that do not fit into the other long-term asset classifications.",what
What are the typical items reported as current liabilities?,"Here are the typical items that are reported as current liabilities on a corporation's balance sheet:
1. Accounts payable. These are the amounts that are due to vendors who have supplied goods or services. The accounts payable are supported by the vendor invoices that have been approved and processed, but have not yet been paid.
2. Deferred revenues. This reports the amounts that a customer has prepaid and will be earned by the company within one year of the balance sheet date. An example is a retailer's unredeemed gift cards.
3. Accrued compensation. Included in this are payroll related items such as the amounts due to employees and the amounts to be remitted for payroll taxes.
4. Other accrued expenses or liabilities. This reports the amounts that the company owes for items not recorded in accounts payable or accrued compensation. Examples include the interest expense that the company has incurred (but has not yet paid) and repairs that took place but the vendor's invoice has not been fully processed.
5. Accrued income taxes and perhaps some deferred income taxes.
6. Short-term notes. These include the loans from banks that will become due within one year of the balance sheet date.
7. The current portion of long-term debt. The principal payments of a mortgage loan or an equipment loan that must be paid within one year of the date of the balance sheet are reported in this item.
To be reported as a current liability the item must be due within one year of the balance sheet date (unless the company's operating cycle is longer). However, there is no requirement that the current liabilities be presented in the order in which they will be paid. Hence, the current portion of long-term debt might be listed last, but the principal payment might be due within several days of the balance sheet date.",what
What is net income?,"Definition of Net Income
Net income is the positive result of a company's revenues and gains minus  its expenses and losses. A negative result is referred to as net loss. (There are a few gains and losses which are not included in the calculation of net income. However, they are part of comprehensive income).
Net income is also known as net earnings. The details of the net income calculation are reported in the business's income statement.
The net income of a regular U.S. corporation includes the income tax expense which pertains to the items reported in its income statement. The net income of a sole proprietorship, partnership, and Subchapter S corporation will not include income tax expense since the owners (not the entity) are responsible for the business's income tax.
Effect of Net Income on the Balance Sheet
A corporation's positive net income causes an increase in the retained earnings, which is part of stockholders' equity. A net loss will cause a decrease in retained earnings and stockholders' equity.
A sole proprietorship's net income will cause an increase in the owner's capital account, which is part of owner's equity. A net loss will cause a decrease in the owner's capital account and owner's equity.",what
What is an account payable?,"Definition of an Account Payable
An account payable is an amount owed to a supplier or vendor for goods or services that were provided in advance of payment. However, some people use the term only if the amount is already recorded in the general ledger account Accounts Payable. (Until it is, they refer to the amount as one of the company's accrued liabilities.) For others, it is an account payable even if it is not yet recorded in Accounts Payable.
Example of an Account Payable
Assume that a corporation received repair services from Joe's Plumbing LLC on August 29. On August 31 the corporation receives an invoice from Joe's for $900. The invoice states that the $900 is due within 30 days. After reviewing and approving the invoice, the corporation enters Joe's invoice into its accounting records with a credit to Accounts Payable and debit to Repairs and Maintenance Expense.
Until the invoice from Joe's Plumbing Service is paid, Joe's invoice serves as a supporting document for the balance in the corporation's Accounts Payable. (The invoice is also a supporting document for the balance in Joe's Accounts Receivable.)",what
Is sales tax an expense or a liability?,"Definition of Sales Tax
In the U.S., a sales tax is a state tax (and possibly an additional local tax) that is paid by the buyer at the time of purchase. The amount of the sales tax is based on the product and the sales tax rate. For instance, in some states unprepared grocery items are not subject to a sales tax. Items purchased for resale are not subject to the sales tax when purchased by the retailer, but will be subject to the sales tax when the items are sold to the end customer. In some cities, there could be a state sales tax of 6% plus a county tax of 1% and a tourist district sales tax of 3%. In another state there could be only a sales tax rate of 8%.
The sales taxes collected by a merchant are not part of the merchant's sales and are not part of the merchant's expenses. Instead, the merchant is merely an agent of the state and will record the sales taxes collected as a current liability. When the merchant remits the sales taxes to the state, the current liability account is reduced. 
If a company purchases a new delivery van, the sales taxes paid on the van are recorded as part of the cost of the van. The total cost of the van will then be charged to depreciation expense over the van's useful life.
Examples of Sales Tax
If a company sells $100,000 of merchandise that is subject to a state sales tax of 7%, the company will collect $107,000. The journal entry to record this information is:

Debit Cash for $107,000
Credit Sales (or Sales Revenues) for $100,000
Credit Sales Taxes Payable for $7,000

When the company remits the $7,000 to the state, the company will credit Cash and debit Sales Taxes Payable. Note that in this example that the sales tax is not an expense and it is not part of the company's sales revenues.
If a company purchases a new delivery van for $50,000 plus $3,500 of sales tax, the company will record the truck as an asset at its total cost of $53,500. In this situation, the sales tax of $3,500 is considered to be a necessary cost of the truck and will be part of the depreciation expense recorded during the useful life of the truck.",what
How does an expense affect the balance sheet?,"Definition of Expense
An expense is a cost that has been used up, expired, or is directly related to the earning of revenues.
Most of a company's expenses fall into the following categories:

cost of goods sold
sales, general and administrative expenses
interest expense

How an Expense Affects the Balance Sheet
An expense will decrease a corporation's retained earnings (which is part of stockholders' equity) or will decrease a sole proprietor's capital account (which is part of owner's equity).
In addition to affecting retained earnings or the owner's capital account, an expense will also cause one or more of the following changes to the balance sheet:

A decrease in Cash, Prepaid Expenses, Supplies on Hand, Inventory
An increase in the credit balance in the contra-asset account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts or Accumulated Depreciation
An increase in the balance in the liability account Accounts Payable, or an increase in Accrued Expenses Payable (including Wages Payable, Interest Payable, etc.)",what
Why is income received in advance a liability?,"Definition of Income Received in Advance
Under the accrual method of accounting, when a company receives money from a customer prior to earning it, the company will have to make the following entry:

Debit Cash
Credit a liability account such as Deferred Revenue, Deferred Income, Unearned Revenue

The credit to the liability account is made because the company has not yet earned the money and the company has an obligation to deliver the goods or services (or to return the money) to the customer. Accountants will state that the company is deferring the revenue until it is earned. Once the money is earned, the liability will be decreased and a revenue account will be increased.
Example of Income Received in Advance
Assume that Jones Corporation received $10,000 from a customer on December 31 for work that will be done in the following month. On December 31, Jones Corporation will debit Cash for $10,000 and will credit Deferred Revenue for $10,000. Therefore, Jones Corporation's December 31 balance sheet's Cash will include the $10,000 and its current liabilities will report Deferred Revenue of $10,000.
After Jones Corporation delivers the goods or services, it will debit Deferred Revenue for $10,000 and will credit Sales Revenues or Service Revenues for $10,000.",what
What are fixed assets?,"Definition of Fixed Assets
Fixed assets are a company's tangible, noncurrent assets that are used in its business operations. The word fixed  indicates that these assets will not be used up, consumed, or sold in the current accounting year.
A company's fixed assets are reported in the noncurrent (or long-term) asset section of the balance sheet in the section described as property, plant and equipment. The fixed assets except for land will be depreciated and their accumulated depreciation will also be reported under property, plant and equipment.
Examples of Fixed Assets
Some of a manufacturer's fixed assets include:

Land, land improvements, buildings
Machinery and equipment
Trucks, automobiles
Furniture and fixtures
Computer systems",what
Are commissions considered to be revenues or expenses?,"Definition of Commissions Revenues or Expenses
The company or person earning and receiving commissions (such as a percentage of sales) will have commissions revenue. The company or party that pays the commissions will have commissions expense. 
Accounting for Commissions Revenues
Under the accrual basis of accounting, the commissions do not have to be received in order to be reported as revenues. If a company has earned the commissions but has not yet received the money, the company should make an accrual adjusting entry so that its income statement will report the commissions revenues and its balance sheet will report the commissions receivable.
Accounting for Commissions Expense
Under the accrual basis of accounting, the commissions do not have to be paid in order for the company to report commissions expense. If a company owes for commissions on recent sales, but has not yet paid or recorded them, an accrual adjusting entry is made so they are included in the commissions expense reported on its income statement and are also reported as commissions payable (or included in accrued liabilities) on its balance sheet.",what
What is the advantage of issuing bonds instead of stock?,"Definition of Bonds
Bonds payable are a form of long-term debt, which include a formal agreement to pay interest semiannually and the principal amount at maturity. The interest is an expense that reduces the corporation's earnings and its taxable income.
Definition of Stock
Shares of common stock are ownership interests in a corporation. There is no promise to pay dividends nor is there a maturity date. The dividends (if any are paid) do not reduce earnings nor do they reduce the corporation's taxable income. 
Advantages of Issuing Bonds Instead of Stock
There are several advantages of issuing bonds (or other debt) instead of issuing shares of common stock:

Interest on bonds and other debt is deductible on the corporation's income tax return while the dividends on common stock are not deductible on the income tax return. Hence, if a corporation's incremental federal and state income tax rate is 30%, bond interest payments of $40,000 will reduce the income tax payments by $12,000 (30% of the $40,000 reduction in taxable income). If the bond interest rate is 6%, the after-tax interest cost is 4.2% [6% minus 1.8% (30% of 6%)].
Since bonds are a form of debt, the existing stockholders' ownership interest in the corporation will not be diluted. Therefore, the future gains from use of the bond proceeds (minus the bond interest payments) will flow to the stockholders. This is related to the concept of leverage or trading on equity.",what
Where is accrued income reported in the balance sheet?,"Definition of Accrued Income
Accrued income refers to amounts that have been earned, but the amounts have not yet been received. For example, a corporation may have its excess cash invested in an investment security that pays interest every six months. Between the interest payment dates, the company will have:

Accrued interest income that is to be reported on the income statement
Accrued interest receivable that is to be reported on the balance sheet

Accrued Income Reported on the Balance Sheet
The amount of accrued income that a corporation has a right to receive as of the date of the balance sheet will be reported in the current asset section of the balance sheet. It could be described as accrued receivables or accrued income.
The amount of the accrued income reported on the income statement also causes an increase in a corporation's retained earnings, which is part of the stockholders' equity section of the balance sheet.
Balance Sheet: Retail/Wholesale - Corporation",what
What is the entry for a loan to an employee?,"Definition of Loan to Employee
A loan to an employee is money advanced by the company to assist the employee. If the employee is expected to repay the loan within one year of the balance sheet date, the loan balance is a current asset of the company. Any amount not expected to be collected within one year is a noncurrent or long term asset.
It is common for the loan to an employee to specify an interest rate and a schedule of payments.
Entry to Record a Loan to Employee
Assume that a company lends an employee $5,000 for a family emergency. The entry will debit Loan to Employee for $5,000 and will credit Cash for $5,000.
Under the accrual method of accounting, at each balance sheet date the company should record any accrued interest by debiting Interest Receivable and crediting Interest Income.
When the employee makes a payment, the company will debit Cash and will credit Interest Receivable and Loan to Employee for the appropriate amounts.",what
What is a contingent asset?,"Definition of Contingent Asset
A contingent asset is a potential asset that is associated with a potential gain. The asset and gain are contingent because they are dependent upon some future event occurring or not occurring.
Because of the concept of conservatism, a contingent asset and gain will not be recorded in a general ledger account or reported on the financial statements until they are certain. [This is different from contingent liabilities and contingent losses, which are recorded in accounts and reported on the financial statements when they are probable and the amount can be estimated.
Example of Contingent Asset
An example of a contingent asset (and its related contingent gain) is a lawsuit filed by Company A against a competitor for infringing on Company A's patent. Even if it is probable (but not certain) that Company A will win the lawsuit, it is a contingent asset and a contingent gain. As such, it will not be recorded in Company A's general ledger accounts until the lawsuit is settled. (At most, Company A could prepare a carefully worded disclosure stating that it has filed the lawsuit but the outcome is uncertain.)",what
How should the sale of gift certificates be recorded in the general ledger?,"Definition of Gift Certificates
Gift certificates (and gift cards) are often sold by a retailer to a buyer for cash. The buyer can then redeem the gift certificate or give it to another person who can redeem the gift certificate for merchandise or services.
Accounting for the Sale of Gift Certificates
The sale of a gift certificate should be recorded with a debit to Cash and a credit to a liability account such as Gift Certificates Outstanding.
Note that revenue is not recorded at this point. Rather, the retailer is recording its obligation/liability to provide merchandise or services for the amount of the certificate sold.
Accounting for the Redemption of a Gift Certificate
When a gift certificate is presented to the retailer, revenue will be recorded by the retailer for the amount of merchandise or services that were provided. This is done with a debit to the liability account Gift Certificates Outstanding and a credit to a revenue account.
Our explanation pertains to financial accounting. To learn about the income tax treatment of this transaction, you should seek advice from a tax professional or go to www.irs.gov.",what
Is it possible for owner's equity to be a negative amount?,"Definition of Negative Owner's Equity
Negative owner's equity means the amount of a sole proprietorship's liabilities exceeds the amount of its assets. 
Example of Negative Owner's Equity
Let's assume that an owner invests $100,000 to begin a new sole proprietorship business. At this point, the owner's equity is a positive $100,000. During the first year of operations, the business's expenses exceeded revenues by $108,000 and there were no draws or additional investments by the owner. The owner's equity at the end of the first year will be a negative $8,000.
The negative amount of owner's equity is a problem that will be obvious to anyone reading the company's balance sheet. However, the company may be able to operate if its cash inflows are greater and sooner than the cash outflows necessary for meeting its payments on its liabilities.",what
What is the difference between paid-in capital and retained earnings?,"Definition of Paid-in Capital
Paid-in capital is one of the major categories of stockholders' equity. Generally, paid-in capital reports the amount that a corporation received from its stockholders (or shareholders) in exchange for the newly issued shares of its capital stock. 
Paid-in capital is also referred to as contributed capital and as permanent capital.
Definition of Retained Earnings
Generally, retained earnings is the cumulative amount of after-tax net income earned by the corporation since its inception minus the dividends that have been distributed to its stockholders since the corporation began.",what
What is the difference between FIFO and LIFO?,"Difference Between FIFO and LIFO
The difference between FIFO and LIFO will exist only if the unit costs of a company's products are increasing or decreasing.
U.S. companies may elect either the FIFO or the FIFO cost flow assumptions. However, after making a change, a company cannot switch back. For U.S. income tax reporting, a company must use the same cost flow assumption as it uses on its financial statements.
Example of Difference Between FIFO and LIFO
Let's assume that a retail store carried only one product during its first year of business. It purchased 30 units in January at a cost of $40 each, 30 units in June at $43 each, and 30 units in November at $46 each. Thus, for the year the retailer purchased 90 units with a total actual cost of $3,870 [[email protected]$40 + [email protected]$43 + [email protected]$46]. Let's also assume that 70 units were sold and that 20 units remain in inventory at the end of the year.
Using FIFO the company assumes that first costs (the oldest costs) for 70 units will be removed from inventory and will become the cost of goods sold. Therefore, the FIFO cost of the 70 units sold had a cost of $2,950 [[email protected]$40 + [email protected]$43 + [email protected]$46]. FIFO also means the 20 units remaining in inventory had the most recent cost of $46 each for a total of $920.
Using LIFO and the periodic inventory system, the company assumes that the last costs (the most recent actual costs) for 70 units will be removed from inventory first and will become the cost of goods sold regardless of which units were physically shipped to customers. Therefore, the LIFO cost of the 70 units sold is $3,070 [[email protected]$46 + [email protected]$43 + [email protected]$40]. LIFO also means that the 20 units remaining in inventory had the oldest cost of $40 each for a total of $800.
In our example, LIFO results in $120 less of ending inventory ($800 vs. $920), $120 more of cost of goods sold, and therefore $120 less of gross profit. The lower gross profit and the associated lower taxable income for a U.S. company can result in less taxable income, which may result in less income tax payments for a profitable corporation.",what
What is the inventory turnover ratio?,"Definition of Inventory Turnover Ratio
The inventory turnover ratio is an important financial ratio that indicates a company's past ability to sell its goods. Converting inventory into cash is critical for a company to pay its obligations when they are due.
How to Calculate the Inventory Turnover Ratio
The calculation for the inventory turnover ratio is: cost of goods sold for a year divided by average inventory during the same 12 months. 
A higher inventory turnover ratio is viewed as better than a lower ratio.
Note: The cost of goods sold is used (not sales) in calculating the inventory turnover ratio because the company's inventory is recorded and reported at its cost (not at its selling prices). However, be cautioned that some people will use sales and therefore will be overstating the inventory turnover ratio. It is also important to use the average amount of inventory throughout the entire year since using only the end-of-the-year amounts may result in a much lower average.
Example of Inventory Turnover Ratio
To illustrate the inventory turnover ratio, let’s assume that during the most recent year a company’s cost of goods sold was $3,600,000 and the average cost of its inventory account during the year was $400,000. As a result, the company’s inventory turnover ratio is: cost of goods sold of $3,600,000 divided by average inventory of $400,000 = 9 times during the recent year. This could be compared to the company's ratio in previous years and to other companies in the same industry.
Even with a favorable inventory turnover ratio, a company may have some excess and obsolete inventory items. Therefore, it is wise to compare the quantity of each item in inventory to the quantity of each item sold during the past year.",what
What is an unpresented cheque or check and does it require an adjustment to the balance sheet?,"Definition of Unpresented Cheque or Check
An unpresented cheque is a check that a company has written, but the check has not yet been paid by the bank on which it is drawn. An unpresented check is also referred to as an outstanding check or a check that has not yet cleared the bank.
In the bank reconciliation, the unpresented or outstanding check is deducted from the balance per the bank in order to arrive at the adjusted or corrected balance per bank.
Effect of Unpresented Check on Balance Sheet
When a company writes a check, the company records it with a credit to the Cash account in the company's general ledger. Whether the check has or hasn't cleared the bank account, the company's Cash account balance is proper. Hence, the company's general ledger Cash account will not require an adjustment for the unpresented or outstanding check when it is reported on the balance sheet.",what
What is the difference between inventory and the cost of goods sold?,"Definition of Inventory
Inventory for a retailer or distributor is the merchandise that was purchased and has not yet been sold to customers. A manufacturer's inventory consists of raw materials, packaging materials, work-in-process, and the finished goods that are owned and on hand.
Inventory is generally valued at its cost and it is likely to be the largest component of the company's current assets. Since the unit cost of inventory items will change over time, a company must select a cost flow assumption (FIFO, LIFO, average) for removing the costs from inventory and sending them to the cost of goods sold.
Definition of Cost of Goods Sold
The cost of goods sold is the cost of the products that have been sold to customers during the period of the income statement. How the costs flow out of inventory will have an impact on the company's cost of goods sold. The cost of goods sold will likely be the largest expense reported on the income statement.
Example of Inventory Cost and Cost of Goods Sold
To show the connection between inventory and the cost of goods sold, let's assume that a retailer sells only one product. Let's also assume that the retailer begins the year with 100 units of the product and purchases an additional 1,500 units throughout the year. The combination of the beginning inventory plus the purchases is known as the goods available for sale, which in this example is 1,600 units. If there are 125 units on hand at the end of the year, the ending inventory will report the cost of 125 units. The cost of goods sold for the year will be the cost of the 1,475 units that are no longer available.",what
Is the installation labor for a new asset expensed or included in the cost of the asset?,"Accounting for Labor to Install Asset
The definition of an asset's cost is all costs that are necessary to get an asset in place and ready for use. Therefore, the cost of the installation labor (wages and related fringe benefits) is part of the cost of the asset (and not an immediate expense of the accounting period).
The total cost of the asset, including installation costs, will become an expense when the asset depreciated over the asset's useful life.",what
How do you record an asset that was partially financed?,"Example of Recording an Asset that was Partially Financed
Assume that your company purchased a car for $10,000 by paying cash of $4,000 and signing a promissory note for $6,000.
The accounting entry is:

Debit the asset account Automobiles for the cost of $10,000
Credit the asset account Cash for the $4,000 that was paid
Credit the liability account Notes Payable for $6,000

The liability account Notes Payable reports the principal amount owed at the time. Interest that will occur in the future is not recorded at the time of the purchase. The reason is that the interest is not owed as of that date.
Each month, one month's interest on the note or loan should be recorded with a debit to Interest Expense and a credit to Cash or Interest Payable (if the interest was not paid). Any cash payments that exceed the amount of interest owed at the time of the payment should be debited to Notes Payable. The balance in the liability account Notes Payable should agree with the principal balance owed to the lender. The balance in the liability account Interest Payable should agree with the interest due as of that date.
You can call the lender to verify the amount of principal and interest owed at a specific date and then compare the amounts to the balances in your general ledger accounts.",what
How does revenue affect the balance sheet?,"Effect of Revenue on the Balance Sheet
Generally, when a corporation earns revenue there is an increase in current assets (cash or accounts receivable) and an increase in the retained earnings component of stockholders' equity .
When a company earns revenue that had been prepaid by a customer, the company's balance sheet's liability deferred revenue will decrease and retained earnings will increase. 
Examples of the Effect of Revenue on the Balance Sheet
Examples of revenue include the sales of merchandise, service fee revenue, subscription revenue, advertising revenue, interest revenue, etc. The revenue accounts are temporary accounts that facilitate the preparation of the income statement. However, when a corporation earns revenue, it has the effect of increasing Retained Earnings. We can see this with the end-of-the-year closing entries which will move all the income statement account balances to Retained Earnings.
Let's assume that today a corporation sold goods on credit. The corporation's current asset Accounts Receivable will increase and the company will credit the income statement account Sales. However, the Sales account is a temporary account that has the effect of increasing the corporation's retained earnings.
Let's assume that on December 31 a corporation received $10,000 for services to be done in January. Therefore, the corporation's cash that is reported on the December 31 balance sheet includes the $10,000 and the balance sheet will also report a current liability deferred revenues of $10,000. In January, when the services have been provided, the corporation will record Service Fee Revenue of $10,000 (which has the effect of increasing the corporation's retained earnings) and will eliminate the current liability of $10,000 that appeared on the December 31 balance sheet.",what
What is cost incurred?,"Definition of Cost Incurred
A cost incurred is a cost that a company (or other organization) becomes liable for.
Example of Cost Incurred
Assume that a retailer begins operations on December 1 and its electric meter is read by the utility on the last day of every month. During December the retailer will have incurred the cost of the electricity it used during December.
Under the accrual basis of accounting the retailer must report a current liability on December 31 for the amount owed to the utility for the electricity it used to that point. On its income statement for December, the retailer must also report electricity expense for the cost of the electricity that it used during December. This may require the retailer to record an accrual adjusting entries with an estimated amount (if the electricity bill is not received in time).",what
What does a balance sheet tell us?,"Definition of Balance Sheet
A balance sheet reports the dollar amounts of a company's assets, liabilities, and  owner's equity (or stockholders' equity) as of midnight of the date shown in the heading.
Examples of Balance Sheet Elements
Assets that are reported on the balance sheet are the company's resources such as cash, accounts receivable, inventory, investments, land, buildings, equipment, some intangible assets . Generally assets are reported at their cost or a lower amount due to the cost principle, depreciation, and conservatism. The cost principle also means that some very valuable aspects of the company are not listed as assets. For example, a company's outstanding reputation, its effective management team, and its amazing brand recognition are not reported as assets if they were not acquired in a transaction involving another party or entity.
Liabilities are a company's obligations as of the balance sheet date and will include loans payable, accounts payable, accrued expenses not yet recorded in accounts payable, warranty obligations, taxes payable, and more.
Stockholders' equity or owner's equity reports the amounts that were invested by the owners plus the company's earnings that the owners chose not to withdraw as dividends or drawings.
Additional Balance Sheet Information
The balance sheet classifications allow the reader to easily compute the amount of a company's working capital and to determine if a company is highly leveraged.
Every balance sheet that is distributed by a company should include notes (or footnote disclosures). These notes provide important additional information concerning the company's financial position including potential liabilities not included in the amounts reported on the face of the balance sheet.",what
What is the difference between dividends and interest expense?,"Dividends are a distribution of a corporation's earnings to its stockholders. Dividends are not an expense of the corporation and, therefore, dividends do not reduce the corporation's net income or its taxable income. When a dividend of $100,000 is declared and paid, the corporation's cash is reduced by $100,000 and its retained earnings (part of stockholders' equity) is reduced by $100,000.
Interest on bonds and other debt is an expense of the corporation. The interest expense will reduce the corporation's net income and its taxable income. When interest expense occurs and is paid, the corporation's cash is reduced by the interest payment, but some cash will be saved by the reduction in income taxes. The corporation's retained earnings will also be reduced by less than the amount of interest expense. For example, if a corporation has an incremental tax rate of 40%, interest expense of $100,000 will result in $40,000 less in income tax expense and income tax payments. This means that an interest payment of $100,000 will reduce the corporation's cash and retained earnings by the net amount of $60,000 ($100,000 of interest minus $40,000 of tax savings).
Since interest is formally promised to the lenders, accountants must accrue interest expense and the related liability Interest Payable. If the payment for interest is not made, the corporation will face legal consequences.
Dividends on common stock are not legally required. Therefore, if the corporation does not declare a dividend there is no liability for the omitted dividends.",what
What does it mean to replenish the petty cash fund?,"Definition of Replenishing Petty Cash
Replenishing the petty cash fund means the petty cash custodian requests and receives cash from the company's regular checking account in an amount that will return the cash on hand to the amount shown in the general ledger account Petty Cash.
Example of Replenishing Petty Cash
Let's assume that a company has a petty cash fund of $100 and its general ledger account Petty Cash has a debit balance of $100. Mary is the petty cash custodian who is the only person handling the petty cash transactions. At all times Mary should have some combination of cash and petty cash vouchers (receipts) that are equal to $100.
Next, let's assume that there is only $20.00 in cash remaining and Mary realizes that $20 is not sufficient. She needs to obtain a company check for $80 in order to cash it and return the cash amount to $100 (the amount shown in the Petty Cash account). The petty cash vouchers provide the documentation for the $80 check request. In the process Mary discovers that the vouchers add up to only $79. Mary will debit the accounts indicated on the petty cash vouchers and then debit Cash Short and Over for $1 (the amount that is not accounted for). 
It is important to realize that the $80 check will be credited to Cash (the company's checking account). There is no entry to the Petty Cash account when merely replenishing the petty cash.",what
How do you account for a project under construction?,"Accounting for a Project Under Construction
If a company is constructing a major project such as a building, assembly line, etc., the amounts spent on the project will be debited to a long-term asset account categorized as Construction Work-in-Progress.
Construction Work-in-Progress is often reported as the last line within the balance sheet classification Property, Plant and Equipment.
There is no depreciation of the accumulated costs until the project is completed and the asset is placed into service.
When the completed asset is placed into service, the project's accumulated costs will be removed from the Construction Work-in-Progress account and will be debited to the appropriate plant asset account.",what
What are accrued revenues and when are they recorded?,"Accrued revenues are fees and interest that have been earned and sales that occurred, but they have not yet been recorded through the normal invoicing paperwork. Since these are not yet in the accountant's general ledger, they will not appear on the financial statements unless an adjusting entry is entered prior to preparing the financial statements.
Here's an example. Your company lent a supplier $100,000 on December 1. The agreement is for the $100,000 to be repaid on February 28 along with $3,000 of interest for the three months of December through February. As of December 31 your company will not have a transaction/invoice/receipt for the interest it is earning since all of the interest is due on February 28. Without an adjusting entry to accrue the revenue it earned in December, your company's financial statements as of December 31 will not be reporting the $1,000 (one-third of the $3,000 of interest) that it has earned in December. In order for the financial statements to be correct on the accrual basis of accounting, the accountant needs to record an adjusting entry dated as of December 31. The adjusting entry will consist of a debit of $1,000 to Interest Receivable (a balance sheet account) and a credit of $1,000 to Interest Income or Interest Revenue (income statement accounts).",what
How do you amortize goodwill?,"Prior to 2001, the U.S. accounting rules required goodwill to be amortized to expense over a period not to exceed 40 years. However, in June 2001 the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued its Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. This accounting pronouncement ended the automatic amortization of goodwill to expense for U.S. financial reporting.
While goodwill is no longer amortized to expense in uniform increments, goodwill is to be measured annually to determine if there is an impairment loss. (However beginning in 2015, private companies may opt to amortize goodwill generally over a 10-year period and thereby minimize the cost and complexity involved with testing for impairment.)",what
What is a liability account?,"A liability account is a general ledger account in which a company records its debt, obligations, customer deposits and customer prepayments, certain deferred income taxes, etc. that are the result of a past transaction. Common liability accounts under the accrual method of accounting include Accounts Payable, Accrued Liabilities (amounts owed but not yet recorded in Accounts Payable), Notes Payable, Unearned Revenues, Deferred Income Taxes (certain temporary timing differences), etc.
The balances in liability accounts are nearly always credit balances and will be reported on the balance sheet as either current liabilities or noncurrent (or long-term) liabilities.
The company with the liability account for the debt or payables is known as the debtor. The lenders, vendors, suppliers, employees, tax agencies, etc. who are owed the money are known as the company's creditors.",what
What is the difference between fixed assets and noncurrent assets?,"Fixed Assets are Part of Noncurrent Assets
Fixed assets are one of several categories of noncurrent assets. Fixed assets are usually reported on the balance sheet as property, plant and equipment.
Noncurrent or long-term assets consist of the following:

Property, plant and equipment (fixed assets)
Long-term investments
Intangible assets
Deferred charges and other noncurrent assets",what
What is a classified balance sheet?,"A classified balance sheet is one that arranges the balance sheet accounts into a format that is useful for the readers. For example, most balance sheets use the following asset classifications:

Liabilities are usually classified as:

current, or
noncurrent or long-term liabilities",what
How do you record bonds that are issued?,"Definition of Bonds Payable
Bonds payable is a form of long-term debt often issued by large corporations especially public utilities when constructing large, expensive power plants for generating electricity.
Bonds typically pay interest semiannually at a fixed rate until the bonds mature many years into the future. If the bonds' interest rate is less than the market rates when the bonds are offered, the bonds will sell at a discount. If the bonds' interest rate is greater than the market rate when the bonds are offered, the bonds will sell at a premium. Any discount or premium on the bonds is recorded in a separate account. Another account is used to record the bond issue costs such as legal fees, auditing fees, registration fees, etc. These bond-related accounts will be presented in the long-term liability section of the balance sheet. Any balances in the discount, premium, or issue costs accounts must be amortized to interest expense over the life of the bonds. 
Example of Recording a Bond Issue
Assume that a corporation issues $100 million of bonds payable at an annual interest rate of 5%. The bonds are offered when the market interest rate is 5.1% and there was no accrued interest. As a result, the investors paid $99.5 million for the bonds. The corporation also incurred $1 million of bond issue costs which were paid from bonds' proceeds.
The entry to record the issuance of the bonds is:

Debit Cash for $98.5 million
Debit Bond Discount for $0.5 million
Debit Bond Issue Costs for $1 million
Credit Bonds Payable for $100 million",what
What are the two methods for recording prepaid expenses?,"Definition of Prepaid Expenses
Prepaid expenses refers to payments made in advance and part of the amount will become an expense in a future accounting period. A common example is paying a 6-month insurance premium in December that provides coverage from December 1 through May 31. 
Examples of Two Methods for Recording Prepaid Expenses
One method for recording a prepaid expense is to record the entire payment in an asset account. For example, assume that on December 1 a company pays an insurance premium of $2,400 for 6 months of liability insurance coverage:

On December 1 the company debits Prepaid Insurance for $2,400 and credits Cash for $2,400
On the last day of December and on the last day of the following 5 months the company needs to record an adjusting entry that debits Insurance Expense for $400 ($2,400 divided by 6 months) and credits Prepaid Insurance for $400

A second method of recording a prepaid expense is to record the entire payment in the expense account. Using the information above, the following entries will occur:

On December 1 the company debits Insurance Expense for $2,400 and credits Cash for $2,400
On the last day of December the company records an adjusting entry that debits the asset account Prepaid Insurance for $2,000 ($2,400 divided by 6 months times the 5 months that will be prepaid as of December 31) and credits Insurance Expense for $2,000
At the end of each of the following 5 months the adjusting entry will debit Insurance Expense for $400 and will credit Prepaid Insurance for $400

Either method for recording prepaid expenses could be used as long as the asset account balance is equal to the unexpired or unused cost as of each balance sheet date.",what
What is a bond sinking fund?,"A bond sinking fund is a restricted asset of a corporation that was required to set aside money for redeeming or buying back some of its bonds payable. The bond sinking fund begins when the corporation deposits money with an independent trustee. The trustee then invests the money in order for the balance in the sinking fund to increase. The balance in the sinking fund will also grow from additional required deposits made by the corporation. The bond sinking fund decreases when the trustee purchases or redeems the corporation's bonds.
Not all corporations with bonds payable are required to have a bond sinking fund. However, bonds with sinking funds are likely to be viewed as less risky.
A bond sinking fund is reported on the bond issuer's balance sheet under the caption Investments, the first long-term (or noncurrent) asset section appearing immediately after current assets.",what
What is common stock?,"Definition of Common Stock
Common stock is the type of ownership interest (expressed in ""shares"") that exists at every U.S. corporation. The owners of common stock are known as common stockholders, common shareholders, or simply as stockholders or shareholders. [A relatively few corporations issue preferred stock in addition to its common stock.]
Generally, the holders of common stock elect the corporation's board of directors, vote on mergers, and participate in a corporation's success or failure through increases or decreases in the market value of their shares of common stock. The cash dividends on common stock often increase as the corporations become more successful.
A drawback of common stock is that the common stockholders are last in line to receive payments if a corporation is dissolved.
Common Stock is also the title of the general ledger account that is credited when a corporation issues new shares of common stock. (The amount of the credit will depend on the state's regulations.) The balance in Common Stock will be reported in the corporation's balance sheet as a component of paid-in capital, a section within stockholders' equity.",what
What is treasury stock?,"Definition of Treasury Stock
Treasury stock is usually a corporation's previously issued shares of common stock that have been purchased from the stockholders, but the corporation has not retired the shares. The number of shares of treasury stock (or treasury shares) is the difference between the number of shares issued and the number of shares outstanding. Since the treasury shares result in fewer shares outstanding, there may be a slight increase in the corporation's earnings per share.
Treasury Stock is also the title of a general ledger account that will have a debit balance equal to the cost of the repurchased shares being held by the corporation. The corporation's cost of treasury stock reduces the corporation's cash and the total amount of stockholders' equity.
The shares of treasury stock will not receive dividends, will not have voting rights, and cannot result in an income statement gain or loss. The shares of treasury stock can be sold, retired, or could continue to be held as treasury stock.
Example of Treasury Stock
A corporation has excess cash and does not see any attractive investments. As a result, it decides to purchase 10,000 shares of its 300,000 shares of common stock that is held by its stockholders. The market value of the 10,000 shares is $40 per share. The corporation's entry to record the purchase of these shares of stock is:

Debit Treasury Stock for $400,000
Credit Cash for $400,000",what
When should a product warranty liability be recorded?,"A product warranty liability and warranty expense should be recorded at the time the product is sold, if it is probable that customers will be making claims under the warranty and the amount can be estimated. These two conditions are part of the FASB's Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. You can read this pronouncement (which includes a discussion of product warranties) at www.FASB.org/st.
When the warranty liability is both probable and can be estimated, the accountant will accrue in the period of the sale a liability and an expense for the future warranty work. (This matching of warranty expense with the related sales revenue is reasonable, since the warranty could be as important in getting the sale as the product's advertising expense.)
When work is done under the warranty coverage, the warranty liability will be reduced. To illustrate, assume that an automobile manufacturer debits Warranty Expense for $1,000 and credits Warranty Liability for $1,000 in the period that a car is sold. When the car needs a $400 repair under the warranty, the manufacturer will reduce Warranty Liability by debiting the account for $400. (Another account, such as Cash, will be credited for the $400 it remits to the dealer that performed the repair work.) This will leave a liability of $600 for additional repairs during the remainder of the warranty period.",what
"If inventory is understated at the end of the year, what is the effect on net income?","If inventory is understated at the end of the year, the net income for the year is also understated.
Here's a brief explanation. If a company has a cost of goods available of $100,000 and it assigns too little of that cost to inventory, then too much of that cost will appear on the income statement as the cost of goods sold. Too much cost on the income statement will mean too little net income.
Another way to view this is through the accounting equation, Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity. If you assign too little of the cost of goods available to Assets, then the amount of Owner's Equity will be too little—caused by net income being too little.",what

Assessed value will likely be the amount that a local or state government has designated for individual properties. This assessed value is used in determining the amount of property tax that the property owner will be assessed and will owe.
Example of Assessed Value
Assume that a company's warehouse is located in a city. The city tax assessor is responsible for determining the assessed value for every parcel of land and every building within the city. The city government then establishes a real estate tax rate to be applied to the assessed values. (There could also be assessed values for personal property.)
The assessed values of real estate or personal property are not necessarily equal to the property's current market value.
Definition of Appraised Value
Appraised value is the amount (or amounts) contained in an appraisal report for a specific property. The appraisal report is generally prepared by a professional appraiser who looks at the property's features including size, type of construction, location, condition, and recent sales of comparable property in the vicinity. The appraised value is an attempt to determine the property's current market value. The appraisal report for real estate will usually report the appraised value of the land separate from the appraised value of the structures. An accountant might use the relationship of these appraised values to allocate the cost of real estate into the cost of the land and the cost of the buildings.
Example of Appraised Value
Appraised values are useful because a company's balance sheet will report its land and buildings at the cost when they were acquired and will report the accumulated depreciation of the buildings. (Land is not depreciated.) Therefore, if the company wants to refinance its real estate, a current appraisal will usually be required.",what
What is liquidity?,"Definition of Liquidity
Liquidity is a company's ability to convert its assets to cash in order to pay its liabilities when they are due.
Current Assets
Generally, the assets that are expected to turn to cash within one year are reported on the balance sheet in the section with the heading current assets. Current assets are listed in the order in which they are expected to turn to cash. This is known as the order of liquidity. Since cash is the most liquid asset, it is listed first. After cash, the order is: temporary investments, accounts receivable, inventory, supplies, and prepaid expenses.
Evaluating Liquidity
Liquidity depends on 1) the speed at which the assets should be turning to cash, or 2) the assets' nearness to cash. For example, some temporary investments are marketable and can be converted to cash very quickly. Accounts receivable may be converted to cash in 10 to 40 days. However, inventory may require several months to be sold and the money collected. Hence, inventory is not considered to be a ""quick asset.""
To assist in evaluating a company's liquidity, the financial ratio known as the quick ratio or acid-test ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the company's quick assets (cash, temporary investments, and accounts receivable) by the amount of the company's current liabilities. [An alternate calculation of the quick ratio is to begin with the amount of the current assets and subtract the amount of inventory. The remainder is then divided by the amount of current liabilities.]
Some Inventory May Not Provide Liquidity
While the current ratio is also referred to as a liquidity ratio, a company with the majority of its current assets in inventory may or may not have the liquidity needed to pay its liabilities as they come due. Its liquidity depends on the speed in which the inventory can be converted to cash.",what
What are consolidated financial statements?,"Consolidated financial statements combine the financial statements of separate legal entities controlled by a parent company into one set of financial statements for the entire group of companies.
For example, let's assume that Northern Electric Power (NEP) is an electric utility with its stock traded on a stock exchange. NEP acquires all of the stock of Midwest Gas Corporation (MGC). Both NEP and MGC continue as separate legal entities. NEP is the parent company and MGC is the subsidiary company. Each of these corporations will continue to operate its respective business and each will issue its own financial statements. However, the investors and potential investors in NEP will find it helpful to see the financial results and the financial position of the economic entity (the combination of NEP and MGC) that they control.
The consolidated income statement of NEP will report all of the revenues that the economic entity earned from outside customers. (Since the sales of electricity from NEP to MGC and the sales of gas from MGC to NEP are not earned outside of the economic entity they are eliminated.) The consolidated income statement will also report all of the expenses that were incurred outside of the economic entity. (Since the purchases of electricity by MGC from NEP and the purchases of gas by NEP from MGC did not occur outside of the economic entity they are also eliminated.)
The consolidated balance sheet of NEP will report all of the cash, receivables, plant, etc. of the economic entity. It will also report all of the liabilities of the economic entity. (Amounts owed and receivable between NEP and MGC are eliminated in the consolidated balance sheet.)
This is a very brief overview of consolidated financial statements. It is a major topic within the university course and textbook entitled advanced accounting.",what
Why isn't the direct write off method of uncollectible accounts receivable the preferred method?,"Definition of Direct Write Off Method
Under the direct write off method of accounting for credit losses pertaining to accounts receivable, no bad debts expense is reported on the income statement until an account receivable is actually removed from the company's receivables.
Under the direct write off method there is no contra asset account such as  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. This means that the balance sheet is reporting the full amount of accounts receivable and therefore implying that the full amount will be converted to cash.
Reason Why the Direct Write Off Method is Not Preferred
The accounting profession does not prefer the direct method for the following reasons:

The accounts receivable are more likely to be reported on the balance sheet at an amount that is greater than the amount that will actually be collected
The bad debts expense resulting from having sold goods on credit will appear on the income statement only after the bad account is identified and removed from the company's accounts receivable. Hence, the bad debts expense is reported much later than would be the case under the allowance method.

[The Internal Revenue Service requires the direct write off method in order to prevent taxpayers from claiming a bad debts expenses based on an anticipated potential loss.]",what
What is interest payable?,"Definition of Interest Payable
Interest payable is the interest expense that has been incurred (has already occurred) but has not been paid as of the date of the balance sheet. [Interest payable does not include the interest for periods after the date of the balance sheet.]
Example of Interest Payable
Let's assume that on December 1 a company borrowed $100,000 at an annual interest rate of 12%. The company agrees to repay the principal amount of $100,000 plus 9 months of interest when the note comes due on August 31.
On December 31, the amount of interest payable is $1,000 ($100,000 X 12% X 1/12) and the company's balance sheet should report the following current liabilities:

Notes payable of $100,000
Interest payable of $1,000

Nothing is reported for the $8,000 of future interest.
The company's January 31 balance sheet should report the following current liabilities:

Notes payable of $100,000
Interest payable of $2,000",what
What is the difference between a balance sheet of a nonprofit organization and a for-profit business?,"A main difference is the section that presents the difference between the total assets and total liabilities. The nonprofit's statement of financial position refers to this section as net assets, whereas the for-profit business will refer to this section as owner's equity or stockholders' equity. The reason is the nonprofit does not have owners. This means that the nonprofit organization's statement of financial position will reflect this equation: assets – liabilities = net assets.
The net assets section will consist of the following parts: net assets without donor restrictions and net assets with donor restrictions. The amounts reported in each of these parts are obviously based on the donor's stipulations.",what
What are capital expenditures?,"Definition of Capital Expenditures
Capital expenditures are the amounts spent for tangible assets that will be used for more than one year in the operations of a business. Capital expenditures, which are sometimes referred to as capex, can be thought of as the amounts spent to acquire or improve a company's fixed assets.
The capital expenditures increase the respective asset accounts which are reported in the noncurrent asset section of the balance sheet entitled property, plant and equipment. Once the assets (except for land) are placed in service they are depreciated over their useful lives. The accumulated depreciation for these assets is also reported as part of the property, plant and equipment.
The amount of capital expenditures for an accounting period is also reported in the cash flow statement as a negative amount (since it is a cash outflow) in the investing activities section. Many financial analysts subtract the capital expenditures amount from the cash from operating activities to arrive at the company's free cash flow.
Examples of Capital Expenditures
Capital expenditures include the amounts spent to acquire or make significant improvements to land, buildings, machinery, equipment, furniture, fixtures, vehicles, computer information systems, leasehold improvements, etc.",what
Why is the P&L profit entered on the credit side of the balance sheet?,"Profit's Effect on the Balance Sheet
The profit or net income belongs to the owner of a sole proprietorship or to the stockholders of a corporation.
If a company prepares its balance sheet in the account form, it means that the assets are presented on the left side or debit side. The liabilities and owner's equity (or stockholders' equity) are presented on the right side or credit side.
Recall that the balance sheet reflects the accounting equation, Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity.
Example of Profit's Effect on the Balance Sheet
Assume that you own and operate a sole proprietorship. You provided a service to a client and earned revenues of $900 and had no expenses. One of the business assets (cash or accounts receivable) increased and the liabilities did not change. As a result, the owner's equity (the owner's capital account) increases.
Accountants do prepare an income statement or P&L to report the revenues and expenses, but the ultimate effect of a positive amount of profit or net income is to increase the business's assets and owner's equity.",what
What are bonds payable?,"Definition of Bonds Payable
Bonds payable are a form of long term debt usually issued by corporations, hospitals, and governments. The issuer of bonds makes a formal promise/agreement to pay interest usually every six months (semiannually) and to pay the principal or maturity amount at a specified date some years in the future. The agreement containing the details of the bonds payable is known as the bond indenture.
U. S. corporations issue bonds instead of common stock for the following reasons:

Debt is less costly than common stock
The interest on bonds is deductible for income tax purposes
Bondholders are not owners and therefore the ownership interest of the existing stockholders will not be diluted

Example of Bonds Payable
Usually public utilities issue bonds to help finance a new electric power plant, hospitals issue bonds for new buildings, and governments issue bonds to finance projects, operating deficits, or to redeem older bonds that are maturing.
For example, a profitable public utility might finance half of the cost of a new electricity generating power plant by issuing 30-year bonds. If the current market interest rate for the bonds is 4%, the cost after the income tax savings may be only 3%.",what
What is inventory valuation?,"In the U.S. inventory valuation is the dollar amount associated with the items contained in a company's inventory. Initially the amount is the cost of the items defined as all of the costs necessary to get the inventory items in place and ready for sale. (The costs of selling and administration are not included in the cost of inventory.)
Since the inventory items are constantly being sold and restocked and since the costs of the items are constantly changing, a company must select a cost flow assumption. Cost flow assumptions include first-in, first-out; weighted average; and last-in, first out. The company is expected to be consistent in its application of the selected cost flow assumption.
A manufacturer's inventory valuation will include the costs of production, namely direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead. Manufacturers are also required to consistently follow their cost flow assumptions.
Inventory valuation is important in that it affects the cost of goods sold, a significant amount reported on the company's income statement. Inventory is also an important component of a company's current assets, working capital, and current ratio.
If the net realizable value of a company's inventory declines to a value which is less than its cost, the company is usually required to report the inventory at its net realizable value. (Net realizable value is the expected selling price minus the the costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.)",what
"If a company earns a profit, which balance sheet items change?","Definition of Profit
Profit is the result of revenues minus expenses.
How Profits Change the Balance Sheet
Since all business transactions affect at least two accounts, there will likely be an enormous number of changes to the balance sheet. Here are some of the changes:

Owner's equity or stockholders' equity will increase by the positive amount of net income
Accounts receivable will change by the amount of sales/services provided with credit terms
Inventory will decrease when goods are sold
Cash will increase when goods are sold for cash and when accounts receivable are collected
Cash will decrease when cash is paid for expenses, inventory, equipment, liabilities, etc.
Accounts payable will increase for expenses that were not paid with cash
Accumulated depreciation will change when an asset is depreciated

Again, the list is just a few of the balance sheet changes that may occur when a company has profitable operations.",what
What is an intangible asset?,"An intangible asset is an asset that you cannot touch. Examples of intangible assets include  copyrights, patents, mailing lists, trademarks, brand names, domain names, and so on.
Often the market value of an intangible asset is far greater than the market value of a company's tangible assets such as its buildings and equipment.
Accounting principles require that intangible assets be reported on a company's balance sheet at cost or less. Since many intangible assets are not purchased, they may not have a reportable cost. As a result, many valuable intangible assets are not even reported as assets on the company's balance sheet.",what
What is the difference between the current ratio and the acid test ratio?,"The difference between the current ratio and the acid test ratio (or quick ratio) mainly involves the current assets inventory and prepaid expenses.
Definition of Current Ratio
The current ratio uses all of the current assets and divides their total by the total amount of current liabilities.
Definition of Acid Test Ratio
The acid test ratio uses only the following current assets (which are considered to be the ""quick assets"") and divides their total by the total amount of current liabilities:

Cash and cash equivalents
Short-term marketable securities
Accounts receivable (net of the allowance for uncollectible accounts)

Notice that inventory (which is a significant current asset for retailers and manufacturers) and prepaid expenses are not included in the list of quick assets and therefore are not included in the acid test ratio.
Example of Current Ratio and Acid Test Ratio
To illustrate the difference between the current ratio and the acid test ratio, let's assume that a company has the following:

Current liabilities $50,000
Cash and cash equivalents $5,000
Short-term marketable securities $10,000
Accounts receivable, net $25,000
Inventory $56,000
Prepaid expenses $4,000

The current ratio is 2 or 2:1 (total current assets of $100,000 divided by the total current liabilities of $50,000).
The acid test ratio is 0.8 or 0.8:1 (quick assets of $40,000 ($5,000 + $10,000 + $25,000) divided by the total current liabilities of $50,000.",what
What are interim financial statements?,"Interim financial statements for a corporation are the financial statements covering a period of less than one year. Often interim financial statements are issued for the quarters between the annual financial statements. The purpose is to give investors and other users updated information on the corporation's operations. Unlike the annual financial statements, the interim financial statements are usually unaudited and condensed. Therefore, it is wise to also read the previously issued and complete annual financial statements and reports.
In order for the interim income statement amounts to add up to the amounts reported in the official income statement for the year, it is necessary that the accounting practices in the interim financial statements be consistent with the accounting practices that will be followed in the annual financial statements.",what
What is a compilation?,"Definition of Compilation
A compilation refers to a company's financial statements that have been prepared or compiled by an outside accountant. 
A compilation is usually part of an accounting firm's write-up service. With compilations, or compiled financial statements, the outside accountant converts the client's data into financial statements without providing any assurances or auditing services.
A compilation report should accompany the compiled financial statements to indicate that the financial statements 1) are the representation of the company's management, and 2) have not been reviewed or audited and therefore the accountant does not offer an opinion or any assurances on the financial statements.
Compilations allow companies without an accountant to have financial statements prepared by an outside professional without the higher cost of reviewed or audited financial statements.
Example of a Compilation
A company prepares its own monthly financial statements by using popular accounting software. However, as part of the company's loan agreement with its bank, the company must provide the bank with annual financial statements that have been compiled by a certified public accountant. (The bank does not require the borrower to incur the expense of a CPA's review or audit.)",what
How should an interest only loan be recorded?,"Defintion of an Interest Only Loan
An interest only loan specifies that only interest payments are required during the life of the loan. No principal payment is required until the loan comes due.
Example of an Interest Only Loan
Assume that on July 1, a company borrows $100,000 with an annual interest rate of 12%. The interest for each month is to be paid on the last day of the month. No principal payment is required until the loan comes due in two years.
On July 1 the company records the loan as follows:

Debit Cash for $100,000 (the proceeds from the loan)
Credit Notes Payable for $100,000 (the principal amount that is due in two years)

Since the principal balance of $100,000 will not be reduced until two years later, the note payable is reported on the balance sheet as a noncurrent or long-term liability for the first year. During the second year the principal balance is reported as a current liability.
If the current month's interest is paid on the last day of each month, there will be no interest liability reported on the end-of-the-month balance sheets. Each month's payment of interest requires a credit to Cash and a debit to Interest Expense, which is reported on the monthly income statement.",what
What are marketable securities?,"Marketable securities are unrestricted financial instruments which can be readily sold on a stock exchange or bond exchange. Marketable securities are often classified into two groups: marketable equity securities and marketable debt securities.
Marketable equity securities include shares of common stock and most preferred stock which are traded on a stock exchange and for which there are quoted market prices.
Marketable debt securities include government bonds and corporate bonds which are traded on a bond exchange and for which there are quoted market prices.",what
What are the elements of financial statements?,"Definition of Elements of Financial Statements
The elements of financial statements are the classes of items contained in the financial statements. 
Examples of Elements of Financial Statements
The elements of the financial statements include:

Assets
Liabilities
Equity or net assets
Investments by owners
Distributions to owners
Comprehensive income
Revenues
Expenses
Gains
Losses

The above list is based on the FASB's Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No. 6, Elements of Financial Statements, which you may read at www.FASB.org.",what
What is the debt to equity ratio?,"Definition of Debt to Equity Ratio
The debt to equity ratio or debt-equity ratio is the result of dividing a corporation's total liabilities by the total amount of stockholders' equity.
Expressed as a formula, the debt to equity ratio is: (Liabilities/Stockholders' Equity):1.
Generally, the higher the ratio of debt to equity, the greater is the risk for the corporation's creditors and prospective creditors.
Example of Debt to Equity Ratio
A corporation with $1,200,000 of liabilities and $2,000,000 of stockholders' equity will have a debt to equity ratio of 0.6:1. A corporation with total liabilities of $1,200,000 and stockholders' equity of $400,000 will have a debt to equity ratio of 3:1.",what
What is the accrual method?,"The accrual method of accounting reports revenues on the income statement when they are earned even if the customer will pay 30 days later. At the time that the revenues are earned the company will credit a revenue account and will debit the asset account Accounts Receivable. (When the customer pays 30 days after the revenues were earned, the company will debit Cash and will credit Accounts Receivable.)
The accrual method of accounting also requires that expenses and losses be reported on the income statement when they occur even if payment will take place 30 days later. For example, if a company has a $15,000 repair done on December 15 and the vendor allows for payment on January 15, the company will report a repair expense and a liability of $15,000 as of December 15. (On January 15 the company will credit Cash and will debit the liability account.)
The accrual method of accounting, which is also known as the accrual basis of accounting, is required for large companies. (The cash method of accounting may be used by individuals and some small companies.) The accrual method and the associated adjusting entries will result in a more complete and accurate reporting of a company's assets, liabilities, equity, and earnings during each accounting period.",what
What is the difference between a contingent liability and an estimated liability?,"Definition of a Contingent Liability
A contingent liability is a potential liability (and a potential loss or potential expense). For a contingent liability to become an actual liability a future event must occur.
Examples of Contingent Liabilities
Assume someone files a lawsuit against Jay Corp. Jay Corp now has a contingent liability. The lawsuit will become an actual liability only if Jay Corp is unsuccessful in defending itself. (Many lawsuits are nuisance suits that will not be victorious in court.)
Another contingent liability is the warranty that automakers provide on new cars. Since it is probable (not merely possible) that some vehicles will require work during the warranty period and the automakers can estimate that amount, the estimated amount of the warranty cost will be reported as a liability on the automakers' balance sheets at the time that the cars are sold. The other part of the journal entry is to debit Warranty Expense and report it on the income statement.
Definition of an Estimated Liability
An estimated liability is a liability that is absolutely owed because the services or goods have been received. However, the vendors' invoices have not yet been received and the exact amount is not yet known. The company is required to estimate the amount since the estimated amount is far better than implying that no liability is owed and that no expense was incurred. Many of the accrual adjusting entries require estimated amounts.
Examples of Estimated Liabilities
Liabilities that are not contingent liabilities but are estimated liabilities include the following:

The electricity and natural gas consumed but the bill has not been received
An emergency repair that occurred but the bill has not been received
Real estate taxes that have occurred but the tax bill has not been received
Worker compensation insurance premiums which have occurred but the bill has not been received

These liabilities must be recorded by using estimated amounts.",what
What is the book value per share of stock?,"If a corporation does not have preferred stock outstanding, the book value per share of stock is a corporation's total amount of stockholders' equity divided by the number of common shares of stock outstanding on that date.
For example, if a corporation without preferred stock has stockholders' equity on December 31 of $12,421,000 and it has 1,000,000 shares of common stock outstanding on that date, its book value per share is $12.42.
Keep in mind that the book value per share will not be the same as the market value per share. One reason is that a corporation's stockholders' equity is simply the difference between the total amount of assets reported on the balance sheet and the total amount of liabilities reported. Noncurrent assets are generally reported at original cost less accumulated depreciation and some valuable assets such as trade names might not be listed on the balance sheet.",what
Is it okay to have negative amounts in the equity section of the balance sheet?,"Definition of Equity Section of the Balance Sheet
The equity section of the balance sheet is known as:

Owner's equity if it is a sole proprietorship. The amount may be reported as a single amount described as owner's capital. On the other hand, it is common for today's accounting software to show three amounts: owner's capital at the start of the year, current year net income, and current year draws by the owner.
Stockholders' equity if it is a corporation. The reported components may be paid-in capital, retained earnings, treasury stock, and accumulated other comprehensive income.

Examples of Negative Amounts in the Equity Section
If the current year's net income is reported as a separate line in the owner's equity or stockholders' equity sections of the balance sheet, a negative amount of net income must be reported. The negative net income occurs when the current year's revenues are less than the current year's expenses.
If the cumulative earnings minus the cumulative dividends declared result in a negative amount, there will be a negative amount of retained earnings. This negative (or positive) amount of retained earnings is reported as a separate line within stockholders' equity.
The owner's drawing account in a sole proprietorship will have a debit balance. Hence, if it is reported as a separate line, it is reported as a negative amount since the owner's equity section of the balance sheet normally has credit balances.
If a corporation has purchased its own shares of stock the cost is recorded as a debit in the account Treasury Stock. The debit balance will be reported as a negative amount in the stockholders' equity section, since this section normally has credit balances. 
Accumulated other comprehensive income can also be a negative (or positive) amount.",what
In what order are liabilities listed in the chart of accounts?,"Order for Listing Liabilities
It is logical for a company's liabilities to be organized in the chart of accounts in the same way as they are presented on the balance sheet:

Current liabilities
Noncurrent or long-term liabilities

Order for Listing Current Liabilities
Within the current liabilities classification, the order in which the current liability accounts are listed can vary. Here is a summary of how they might be organized:

Short-term notes payable
Current portions of long-term debt
Accounts payable
Payroll related liabilities
Other accrued expenses
Income taxes payable

Again, the order will vary. For example, some companies will list Accounts Payable as the first current liability account.",what
What is the difference between a land improvement and a leasehold improvement?,"Examples of land improvements include paved parking areas, driveways, fences, outdoor lighting, and so on. Land improvements are recorded separately from land, because land improvements have a limited life and are depreciated. Land is assumed to last indefinitely and will not be depreciated.
Land improvements are recorded in a general ledger asset account entitled Land Improvements. The depreciation of land improvements will result in depreciation expense on the company's income tax return. This will reduce its taxable income and will reduce a profitable company's income tax payments.
An example of a leasehold improvement is the permanent improvement to a building that is being rented under a 10 year lease. For instance, the tenant might construct permanent walls and offices inside of the warehouse that it leases from the owner. The lease will likely state that all improvements to the building will belong to the owner of the building. The amount spent by the tenant to improve the building will be recorded by the tenant in its asset account Leasehold Improvements. Generally, the amount of these leasehold improvements will be depreciated by the tenant over the useful life of the improvements or over the life of the lease, whichever is shorter. The depreciation expense associated with the leasehold improvements will reduce the tenant's taxable income and its income tax payments if the company is profitable.",what
Where does a bond sinking fund appear on the balance sheet?,"A bond sinking fund is reported in the section of the balance sheet immediately after the current assets. The bond sinking fund is part of the long-term asset section that usually has the heading ""Investments.""
The bond sinking fund is a long-term (noncurrent) asset even if the fund contains only cash. The reason is the cash in the fund must be used to retire bonds, which are long-term liabilities. In other words, because the money in the bond sinking fund cannot be used to pay current liabilities, it must be reported outside of the working capital section of the balance sheet. (Working capital is current assets minus current liabilities.)",what
How can working capital be improved?,"Definition of Working Capital
Working capital is defined as the amount by which a company's current assets exceed its current liabilities.
How Working Capital Can be Improved
Some of the ways that working capital can be increased include:

Earning additional profits
Issuing common stock or preferred stock for cash
Borrowing money on a long-term basis
Replacing short-term debt with long-term debt
Selling long-term assets for cash

In addition to increasing working capital, a company can improve its working capital by making certain that its current assets are converted to cash in a timely manner. For example, if a company can better manage its inventory and its accounts receivable, the company's cash and liquidity will increase. This in turn improves the company's working capital. Similarly, if the company can negotiate more favorable credit terms with its suppliers, the company will have the benefit of having a larger cash balance (even though the amount of working capital will not change).",what
What is the accounts receivable collection period?,"The accounts receivable collection period is similar to the days sales outstanding or the days sales in accounts receivable.
To illustrate the accounts receivable collection period, let's assume a corporation had net credit sales of $360,000 during the past year and its accounts receivable balance was on average $40,000. The average credit sales per day were approximately $1,000 per day ($360,000 of annual credit sales divided by 360 or 365 days per year). The average accounts receivable balance of $40,000 divided by $1,000 of credit sales per day equals 40 days.
An alternative calculation is to use the accounts receivable turnover ratio. In our example, the accounts receivable ratio is 9 times per year ($360,000 of net credit sales divided by $40,000—the average accounts receivable balance). 360 days per year divided by the accounts receivable turnover of 9 equals 40 days.
Accounts Receivable Turnover Days Sales in Accounts Receivable
Balance Sheet: Retail/Wholesale - Corporation",what
How do you estimate the amount of uncollectible accounts receivable?,"One way to estimate the amount of uncollectible accounts receivable is to prepare an aging. An aging of accounts receivable lists every customer's balance and then sorts each customer's balance according to the amount of time since the date of the sale. For example, assume that all sales are made with terms of 30 days. Let's also assume that Customer A has an accounts receivable balance of $12,000—consisting of $8,000 that was sold 15 days ago and $4,000 that was sold 40 days ago.
The $8,000 will be entered into the column with the heading ""Current"" and $4,000 will be entered into the column with the heading ""1-30 days past due."" After the sorting/entering is done for each and every customer, the columns are summed. The ""Current"" column is likely to be collectible. However, the amounts in the column headed ""1-30 days past due"" might not be 100% collected. The amounts in the column with the heading ""31-60 days past due"" will have a higher probability of being uncollectible. The column ""61-90 days past due"" indicates a still greater likelihood of not being collected. And the amounts in the column ""More than 90 days past due"" will be even less likely to be collected in their entirety.
Examining the details of each of the past due accounts will help you estimate the amount that will likely be uncollectible.
Another way to estimate the amount of uncollectible accounts is to simply record a percentage of credit sales. For example, if your company and its industry has a long run experience of 0.2% of credit sales being uncollectible, you might enter 0.2% of each period's credit sales as a debit to Bad Debt Expense and a credit to Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.",what
How many years is the appropriate time for depreciating leasehold improvements?,"Leasehold improvements should be depreciated or amortized according to the lessee's normal depreciation policy except that the time period shall be the shorter of: 1) the useful life of the leasehold improvements, or 2) the remaining years of the lease. The remaining years of the lease include the years in the lease renewals that are reasonably assured.
A discussion of your question was done by the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). You can read it by selecting EITF 05-6 at www.fasb.org/st.",what
What is a contra liability account?,"A contra liability account is a liability account where the balance is expected to be a debit balance. Since a debit balance in a liability account is contrary to the normal credit balance, the account is referred to as a contra liability account.
The most common contra liability accounts are Discount on Bonds Payable, Bond Issue Costs, Debt Issue Costs, and Discount on Notes Payable. The debit balances in these accounts are amortized or allocated to Interest Expense over the life of the bonds or notes.
The credit balance in the liability account Bonds Payable minus the debit balances in the contra liability accounts Discount on Bonds Payable and Bond Issue Costs is the carrying value or book value of the bonds. The credit balance in Notes Payable minus the debit balances in Discount on Notes Payable and Debt Issue Costs is the carrying value or book value of the notes payable.",what
How is working capital defined and measured?,"Working capital is the amount of current assets minus the amount of current liabilities as of specific date. These amounts are obtained from your company's balance sheet. For example, if your company's balance sheet reports current assets of $450,000 and current liabilities of $320,000 then your company's working capital is $130,000.
Even with a significant amount of working capital, a company can experience a cash shortage if its current assets are not turning to cash. For example, if a company has most of its current assets in the form of inventory, that inventory needs to be sold. Similarly, if a company has a large amount of receivables that are not being collected, the working capital amount isn't much consolation when you can't meet Friday's payroll.
There are several financial ratios that pertain to working capital. They include the current ratio, quick ratio, accounts receivable turnover ratio, days sales in accounts receivable, inventory turnover ratio, and days sales in inventory.
Monitor your current assets daily to keep the cash coming into your checking account. If you do the right things each day, your financial ratios have a better chance of being respectable at the end of the month.",what
What is the debt ratio?,"Definition of Debt Ratio
The debt ratio is also known as the debt to asset ratio or the total debt to total assets ratio. Hence, the formula for the debt ratio is: total liabilities divided by total assets.
The debt ratio indicates the percentage of the total asset amounts (as reported on the balance sheet) that is owed to creditors.
The larger the debt ratio the greater is the company's financial leverage. The appropriate debt ratio depends on the industry and factors that are unique to the company. 
Example of Debt Ratio
Assume that a corporation's balance sheet reports total liabilities of $60,000 and total assets of $100,000. The corporation's debt ratio is 0.60 or 60% ($60,000 divided by $100,000).",what
What is a promissory note?,"Definition of Promissory Note
A promissory note is a written promise to pay an amount of money by a specified date (or perhaps on demand). The maker of the promissory note agrees to pay the principal amount and interest.
The maker of the promissory note is known as the borrower or debtor and records the amount owed in a liability account such as Notes Payable. The person or organization that has the right to receive the money when the promissory note comes due is known as the lender or creditor and records that amount in an asset account such as Notes Receivable.
Under the accrual method of accounting, both the borrower and the lender must report any accrued interest  as of each balance sheet date. The maker/borrower of the note will report interest expense and interest payable. The creditor/lender will report the accrued interest as interest income and interest receivable.
Example of a Promissory Note
A promissory note is created when a company borrows money from its bank. However, a promissory note could also be used when a company is unable to pay one of its suppliers as agreed. In that situation, the supplier may demand that the company issue a promissory note. This results in the company replacing its account payable with a note payable, and the supplier replacing its account receivable with a note receivable.",what
What are the required financial statements?,"The required financial statements for U.S. business corporations are:

Statement of income. This financial statement is also known as the statement of operations, statement of earnings, or income statement. It reports the corporation's revenues, expenses, gains and losses (except for items stipulated as other comprehensive income) for a period of time such as a year, quarter, 13 months, etc.
Statement of comprehensive income. This financial statement begins with the bottom line of the income statement and then lists the items considered to be other comprehensive income. Some of these items involve currency translation, hedging, and pensions.
Balance sheet. This statement of financial position reports a corporation's assets, liabilities and stockholders' equity as of the final instant of the date shown in its heading (December 31, January 31, June 30, etc.)
Statement of cash flows. This statement reports the major causes for the change in cash and cash equivalents during the accounting period. The cash flows are presented as operating, investing, or financing activities.
Statement of stockholders' equity. This financial statement is often presented as the statement of shareholders' equity, statement of equity, statement of changes in stockholders' equity, etc. It reports all of the changes in stockholders' equity which occurred during the accounting period.

The five annual financial statements must be accompanied with notes to the financial statements. These notes are needed in order to disclose additional information about items that are reported or are not reported in the financial statements.
You can see examples of the required financial statements (and the required notes) for a publicly traded U.S. corporation by searching the Internet for the corporation's name plus the words investor relations. Select Annual Reports (or select SEC filings and annual reports or 10-K).",what
What is the difference between Rent Receivable and Rent Payable?,"The asset account Rent Receivable is used by the landlord to report the amount of rent that has been earned by the landlord but has not been received from the tenant as of the balance sheet date. The liability account Rent Payable is used by the tenant to report the amount of rent that the tenant owes for rent but has not been paid as of the balance sheet date.
If the rent is to be paid on the first day of each month, and if the rent is paid on time, the landlord will have a zero balance in Rent Receivable. Similarly, the tenant will have a zero balance in Rent Payable. It is only if the tenant falls behind in making the rent payments that amounts will be entered into the Rent Receivable and Rent Payable accounts.",what
What are the notes to the financial statements?,"Definition of Notes to Financial Statements
The notes to the financial statements are a required, integral part of a company's external financial statements. They are required since not all relevant financial information can be communicated through the amounts shown (or not shown) on the face of the financial statements. The notes are also referred to as footnote disclosures.
Generally, the notes are the main method for a company to comply with the full disclosure principle.
Example of Notes to Financial Statements
The first note to the financial statements is usually a summary of the company's significant accounting policies for the use of estimates, revenue recognition, inventories, property and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, fair value measurement, discontinued operations, foreign currency translation, recently issued accounting pronouncements, and others.
The remaining notes contain the details (including schedules of amounts) for items such as inventories, accrued liabilities, income taxes, employee benefit plans, leases, business segment information, fair value measurements, derivative instruments and hedging, stock options, commitments and contingencies, and more. 
Each external financial statement should also include a reference to the notes, such as: The accompanying notes are an integral part of the financial statements.",what
What is the difference between the Cash Flow and Funds Flow statements?,"The cash flow statement, known formally as the Statement of Cash Flows, reports a company's change in cash and cash equivalents from one balance sheet date to another. The cash flow statement classifies the amount of the change according to operating, investing, and financing activities. The cash flow statement has been required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board since 1988, when it issued its Statement No. 95. You can read about the statement of cash flows at www.FASB.org/st.
Prior to 1988, accountants prepared a funds flow statement. Generally, the funds flow statement reported on the change in working capital from one balance sheet date to another.",what
What is long-term debt?,"Definition of Long-term Debt
In accounting, long-term debt generally refers to a company's loans and other liabilities that will not become due within one year of the balance sheet date. (The amount that will be due within one year is reported on the balance sheet as a current liability.)
Example of Long-term Debt
Let's assume that a company has a mortgage loan with a principal balance of $200,000 with 120 monthly payments remaining. The loan payments due in the next 12 months include $12,000 of principal payments. The $200,000 of debt should be reported on the company's balance sheet as follows:

$188,000 as a long-term or noncurrent liability such as noncurrent portion of mortgage loan
$12,000 as a current liability such as current portion of mortgage loan

When the word ""debt"" is used to mean ""liabilities"" (as is done in financial ratios) then other examples will include vehicle loans, bonds payable, capital lease obligations, pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations, and deferred income taxes.
Some long-term debt that will be due within one year can continue to be reported as a noncurrent liability if the company intends to refinance the debt and can prove it will be done within 12 months without reducing its working capital.",what
What is a deferred cost?,"A deferred cost is a cost that occurred in a transaction, but will not be expensed until a future accounting period.
An example of a deferred cost is the fees necessary to register a new bond issue. A company will likely have to pay attorneys and accountants to prepare and audit the many statements required by government agencies. When these fees are significant, they are recorded as deferred costs in the long-term liability account, Bond Issue Costs or Unamortized Bond Issue Costs. The amount of the deferred costs will then be amortized (systematically charged) to Interest Expense over the life of the bonds.
A second example is the amount paid in advance for the next six months of insurance. This prepayment is a deferred cost that is recorded in the current asset Prepaid Insurance. In each of the future months, one-sixth of the deferred amount of the insurance premium should be charged to Insurance Expense.
The capitalization of interest involved when a company constructs its own building is also a deferred cost. The reason is that the interest will be added to the cost of the building and depreciated over the life of the building—instead of being expensed immediately as interest expense.",what
What is the working capital ratio?,"Some use the term working capital ratio to mean working capital or net working capital. Working capital is defined as current assets minus current liabilities. When used in this manner, working capital ratio is not really a ratio. Rather, it is simply a dollar amount.
For example, if a company has $900,000 of current assets and has $400,000 of current liabilities, its working capital is $500,000. If a company has $900,000 of current assets and has $900,000 of current liabilities, it has no working capital.
Other people use the term working capital ratio to mean the current ratio, which is defined as the amount of current assets divided by the amount of current liabilities.",what
What is the entry when merchandise has been received but not the vendor's invoice?,"If you received merchandise, but have not received the vendor's invoice by the end of the accounting period, you need to 1) debit Purchases (periodic method) or debit Inventory (perpetual method) for the cost of the goods or merchandise received, and 2) credit Accounts Payable. You also need to include the merchandise in your physical inventory.
When the vendor's invoice is received and processed, be sure to reverse (remove) the above entry.",what
Does collecting a customer's accounts receivable affect net income?,"Collecting accounts receivable that are in a company's accounting records will not affect the company's net income. (Generally speaking, net income is revenues minus expenses.)
Under the accrual basis of accounting, revenues and accounts receivable are recorded when a company sells products or earns fees by providing services on credit. At the point of delivering the goods or services, the company debits Accounts Receivable and credits Sales Revenues or Service Revenues. When an account receivable is collected 30 days later, the asset account Accounts Receivable is reduced and the asset account Cash is increased. No revenue account is involved at the time of collection.
Your question brings to light the difference between a receipt and a revenue. Cash receipts from collecting accounts receivable or from the proceeds of a bank loan are not revenues. Revenues are amounts that companies earn through their operations by selling products or providing services (whether or not cash is received at the time of the sale or service).",what
What are the ways to value inventory?,"Generally, the balance sheet of a U.S. company must value inventory at cost. In other words, a company's inventory is not reported at the sales value. (An exception occurs when a company's inventory consists of readily salable commodities that have quoted market prices.)
Since the costs of products may change during an accounting year, a company must select a cost flow assumption that it will use consistently. For instance, should the oldest cost be removed from inventory when an item is sold? If so, the company will select the cost flow assumption known as first-in, first out (FIFO). In the U.S. an alternative is to remove the period's most recent cost when an item is sold. This is known as last-in, first-out (LIFO). Another option is to use an average method such as the weighted-average method or the moving-average method. Both the LIFO method and the average methods will result in different values depending on whether a company uses the perpetual method or the periodic method. Still another option is to use the specific identification method.
The LIFO cost flow assumption can be achieved by tracking the units in inventory or by using price indexes. When price indexes are used, it is referred to as dollar-value LIFO. (Retailers often use a technique called dollar-value retail LIFO.)
The accountants' concept of conservatism can result in some inventories being valued at less than cost. Hence, an additional method for valuing inventory is the lower of cost or net realizable value. For example, if the net realizable value of a company's inventory has declined to an amount that is less than cost, the company will likely have to reduce its inventory cost. The amount of that adjustment will also reduce the current period's net income.
A company's inventory must be measured and reviewed very carefully as it is an important amount for determining a company's financial position and profitability.",what
What is the difference between unearned revenue and unrecorded revenue?,"In financial accounting, unearned revenue refers to amounts received prior to being earned. For example, if ABC Service Co. receives $24,000 on December 31, 2012 for a one-year service agreement covering January 1 through December 31, 2013, the entire $24,000 is unearned as of December 31, 2012. On the December 31, 2012 balance sheet ABC should report a liability such as Unearned Revenues for $24,000. During 2013 ABC should move $2,000 per month from the liability account on its balance sheet to a revenue account on its income statement.
I associate unrecorded revenue with revenues that were earned, but not yet recorded in a company's accounting records. For example, an electric utility will provide electricity to customers for up to one month before it reads the customers' meters, calculates the bills and records the billings as revenues and accounts receivable. As a result, the electric utility will have up to one month of unrecorded revenue. At each balance sheet date, the utility should accrue for the revenues it earned but had not yet recorded. This is done through an adjusting entry that debits a balance sheet receivable account and credits an income statement revenue account.",what
How do you calculate the payroll accrual?,"The payroll accrual is the amount that needs to be entered into a liability account in order for the credit balance in the liability account to be the amount owed to employees. The amount owed is the amount the employees have earned from working, but as of the date of the balance sheet this amount has not been paid to the employees.
To illustrate the payroll accrual, assume that a company's employees were paid on September 30 for their work through September 25. The credit balance needed in the liability account as of September 30 is the amount that the employees earned for the days of September 26 through September 30.",what
What is the difference between bad debt and doubtful debt?,"Some people will use these terms or account titles interchangeably: Bad Debt Expense, Doubtful Account Expense, Uncollectible Account Expense. The same for these terms or account titles: Allowance for Bad Debts, Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts.
The ""Allowance for ..."" is a balance sheet account. However, it is a contra account to the asset Accounts Receivable. (Generally, the Allowance account will have a credit balance—whereas Accounts Receivable and other asset accounts normally have debit balances.) The Allowance account communicates to the reader of the balance sheet the amount of Accounts Receivable that will likely not be collected.
The three Expense account titles listed above are income statement accounts and will have the usual debit balance. These expense accounts report how much bad debt expense was incurred during the period shown in the heading of the income statement.

Why do you separate current liabilities from long-term liabilities?,"Current liabilities are separated from long-term liabilities on classified balance sheets. (You don't have to prepare a classified balance sheet, but it is the norm. Classified balance sheets also separate the current assets from the long-term assets.)
Current liabilities are the obligations that are due within one year of the balance sheet's date and will require a cash payment or will need to be renewed. Knowing which liabilities will have to be paid within one year is important to lenders, financial analysts, owners, and executives of the company. (Current assets include cash and other assets that will turn to cash within one year.) Knowing the liabilities that are due within one year and the amount of assets turning to cash within one year are so important that it makes sense to prepare a classified balance sheet.
The amount of current liabilities is used in two of the most common financial ratios. Working capital is the amount of current assets minus the amount of current liabilities. The current ratio is computed by dividing the amount of current assets by the amount of current liabilities.",what
Why would Prepaid Insurance have a credit balance?,"Several situations could cause a credit balance in the asset account Prepaid Insurance. For example, let's assume a company's insurance has a cost of $600 every six months. As a result, the company decides to debit Prepaid Insurance when the amount is paid semiannually. It also prepares an automatic monthly adjusting entry to debit Insurance Expense $100 and to credit Prepaid Insurance for $100. If one of the $600 payments is debited to Insurance Expense (or another account) instead of Prepaid Insurance, the monthly adjusting entries will cause the balance in the Prepaid Insurance account to become a credit balance.
Another possibility is that the company simply failed to pay the insurance company and the monthly adjusting entries caused the balance in Prepaid Insurance to become a credit balance. Whatever the cause of the credit balance in Prepaid Insurance, the account balance needs to be adjusted before issuing a balance sheet. The Prepaid Insurance account must report the true amount that is prepaid (paid but not yet expired) as of the date of the balance sheet. If nothing is prepaid then the Prepaid Insurance account must show a zero balance. If an amount is owed to the insurance company, there should be a liability account with a credit balance for the amount owed as of the balance sheet date.
Because adjusting entries involve a balance sheet account and an income statement account, it is wise to also look at the amount being reported in the income statement account Insurance Expense. You should monitor both the Insurance Expense account balance and the Prepaid Insurance account balance throughout the year. The amount paid to the insurance company that has expired needs to be reported as an expense and the amount that has not yet expired needs to be reported as the asset Prepaid Insurance.",what
What is solvency?,"I use the term solvency to mean 1) that a company is able to pay its obligations when they come due and 2) that a company is able to continue in business.
Some people look to a company's working capital in deciding whether a company is solvent. They conclude that a company with a positive amount of working capital is solvent. In other words, a company that is solvent has more current assets than it has current liabilities. Stated another way a company that is solvent will have a current ratio that is greater than 1:1.
Others look at a company's total assets and total liabilities in deciding whether a company is solvent. They might conclude that if a company's total assets are greater than its total liabilities, the company is solvent.
I suspect that the definition of  solvency varies among people in the same country and from country to country. You should check the legal system in your country to find the appropriate meaning.",what
Where does accrued interest on notes receivable get reported on the balance sheet?,"Accrued interest on notes receivable is likely to be reported as a current asset such as Accrued Interest Receivable or Interest Receivable. The accrued interest receivable is a current asset if the interest amount is expected to be collected within one year of the balance sheet date.
I would expect that even a long-term note receivable that is due in five years will require that the interest on the note be paid quarterly, semiannually or annually. Hence the accrued interest will be a current asset.
If the interest on the note is not expected to be received within one year of the balance sheet date, then the accrued interest receivable should be reported as a long-term asset.",what
"What is the advantage of using historical cost on the balance sheet for property, plant and equipment?","The main advantage of using historical cost on the balance sheet for property, plant and equipment is that historical cost can be verified. Generally, the cost at the time of purchase is documented with contracts, invoices, payments, transfer taxes, and so on.
The historical cost of plant and equipment (not land) is also used to determine the amount of depreciation expense reported on the income statement. The accumulated amount of depreciation is also reported as a deduction from the assets' historical costs reported on the balance sheet. (In the case of impairment, some assets might be reported at less than the amounts based on historical cost.)
The use of historical cost is also a disadvantage to those users of the financial statements who want to know the current values.",what
How are fully depreciated assets reported on the balance sheet?,"Fully depreciated assets that continue to be used are reported at cost in the Property, Plant and Equipment section of the balance sheet. The accumulated depreciation for these assets is also reported in this section. As a result, the combination of these assets' costs minus their accumulated depreciation will likely be a net amount of zero. This net amount is the carrying amount, carrying value or book value.
The cost and accumulated depreciation will continue to be reported until the company disposes of the assets. The disposal might be the sale or the retirement of the assets.
Fully depreciated assets and their resulting book value of zero reinforces accountants' position that depreciation is a process to allocate assets' costs to expense; it is not a process for valuing assets.",what
Does paying an account payable affect net income?,"Paying accounts payable that are already included in a company's accounting records will not affect the company's net income. (Generally speaking, net income is revenues minus expenses.)
Under the accrual basis of accounting, if an expense is associated with an accounts payable, the expense will be recorded at the time the accounts payable is recorded—not at the time of the payment. For example, on January 2 a company has its office copier repaired. The cost of the repair is $300 and is to be paid by January 31. On January 2, the invoice for the repair is recorded with a $300 debit to Repairs and Maintenance Expense–Office Equipment and a $300 credit to Accounts Payable. On January 31 when the invoice is paid, the company will debit Accounts Payable and will credit Cash for $300. As you see, the January 31 transaction affects two balance sheet accounts; no expense account or other income statement account is involved.
The January 31 transaction also illustrates that an expenditure is not necessarily an expense. Here are two additional examples: (1) A company pays cash to purchase an asset that will be used in the business. At the time of the purchase, an expenditure takes place, but not an expense. The expense will occur later when the asset is depreciated. (2) A company repays $50,000 of principal owed on its bank loan. The $50,000 is an expenditure, but it is not an expense.
Expenses are costs that are used up in order for the company to earn revenues. Expenses are also costs that expired during an accounting period. Under accrual accounting, expenses can occur before or after a cash expenditure is made.",what
What is the purpose of the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts?,"The Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is used when Bad Debt Expense is recorded prior to knowing the specific accounts receivable that will be uncollectible. For example, a company might have 500 customers purchasing on credit and they owe the company a total of $1,000,000. The $1,000,000 is reported on the company's balance sheet as accounts receivable.
The company doesn't know specifically which customer will not pay, but it estimates that a few customers out of the 500 will not be paying the full amount they owe. The company estimates that $10,000 will not be collected. Rather than waiting until those specific customers are identified, the company makes an accounting entry that debits Bad Debt Expense and credits Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.
The amount of the entry will be the amount necessary to get the ending balance in the Allowance account to be a credit of $10,000. When the balance sheet is prepared, it will show Accounts Receivable of $1,000,000 less the Allowance of $10,000 for a net realizable value of $990,000—the amount that will likely be turned into cash.
The entry also meant that the income statement will be reporting $10,000 of Bad Debt Expense sooner than if the company waited for the customers to admit they were not able to pay. This means that the expense is matched more closely with the revenues—the goal of accounting's matching principle.
While this allowance method is good for financial reporting, it might not be allowed for income tax purposes. Be sure to check with a tax professional for the income tax rules.",what
Should trademarks be included on the balance sheet?,"A trademark should be reported on the balance sheet as an intangible asset. However, the cost principle prevents the reported amount from being more than the cost of acquiring and defending the trademark. A trademark that was developed internally (rather than purchased) might have a cost of $0, and therefore it will not be listed on the balance sheet.
For example, Company X, a consumer products company, introduced a new product in 1960. It registered the trademark in 1960 for a small fee that was immediately expensed. Since then Company X has been very effective in promoting this trademarked brand. Consumers now pay a premium price for this recognized and superior product. A competitor offers to purchase the trademark from Company X for $300 million in cash. If Company X does not sell the trademark, Company X will not list the trademark as an asset. (Recall that the trademark's cost was $0.)
If Company X were to sell the trademark to Company Y for $300 million, Company Y will report the trademark on its balance sheet at $300 million. The reason is that there was a transaction for $300 million and Company Y's cost of the trademark was indeed $300 million.",what
How does petty cash affect expenses?,"Definition of Petty Cash
Petty cash is a small amount of currency and coins that a company has available to make very small payments instead of requesting and processing a company check. The amount of the petty cash fund is recorded in a current asset account entitled Petty Cash when the petty cash fund is established.
Example of Petty Cash Affecting Expenses
Assume that the petty cash money is used to pay postage of $10. While the company incurs this cost at the time of payment, it will be recorded in the general ledger account Postage Expense when the petty cash fund is replenished. 
In order to get the expenses entered in the proper accounting period, it is necessary to replenish the petty cash fund at the end of each accounting period. (This is done in addition to replenishing the fund whenever the currency and coins are low.)",what
What is the difference between the current ratio and working capital?,"The current ratio is the proportion (or quotient or fraction) of the amount of current assets divided by the amount of current liabilities.
Working capital is not a ratio, proportion or quotient, but rather it is an amount. Working capital is the amount remaining after current liabilities are subtracted from current assets.
To illustrate the difference between the current ratio and working capital, let's assume that a company's balance sheet reports current assets of $60,000 and current liabilities of $40,000. The company's current ratio is 1.5 to 1 (or 1.5:1, or simply 1.5) resulting from dividing $60,000 by $40,000. The company's working capital is $20,000 which is the remainder after subtracting $40,000 from $60,000.

What is the difference between reserve and provision?,"In the U.S. the use of the word reserve has been discouraged for several decades. In its place, the accounting profession has recommended the use of words such as allowance, accumulated, or provision. For instance, many years ago the contra account to a plant asset may have been titled Depreciation Reserve. To some readers, that name implied that cash had been set aside to replace the asset. To better communicate reality, the accounting profession recommended a more descriptive title such as Accumulated Depreciation. Similarly, the contra account to Accounts Receivable may have been titled Reserve for Bad Debts. Again, that title could imply that money was set aside. To avoid misinterpretation, the accounting profession suggested Allowance for Bad Debts or Provision for Bad Debts.
The word provision might appear in the title of a contra account as we just noted. In addition, provision will occasionally appear in the title of an expense account, such as Provision for Income Taxes.",what
What is the difference between the current ratio and the quick ratio?,"The current ratio is the proportion (or quotient or fraction) of the amount of current assets divided by the amount of current liabilities.
The quick ratio (or the acid test ratio) is the proportion of 1) only the most liquid current assets to 2) the amount of current liabilities. In other words, the quick ratio assumes that only the following current assets will turn to cash quickly: cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Hence, the quick ratio does not include inventories, supplies, and prepaid expenses.
To illustrate the difference between the current ratio and the quick ratio, let's assume that a company's balance sheet reports current assets of $60,000 and current liabilities of $40,000. Its current assets include $35,000 of inventory and $1,000 of supplies and prepaid expenses. The company's current ratio is 1.5 to 1 [$60,000 divided by $40,000]. Its quick ratio is 0.6 to 1 [($60,000 minus $36,000) divided by $40,000].

What is other comprehensive income?,"Definition of Other Comprehensive Income
Other comprehensive income, or OCI, consists of items that have an effect on the balance sheet amounts, but the effect is not reported on the company's income statement. Instead, these changes are reported on the statement of comprehensive income along with the amount of net income from the income statement.
Since the OCI items do not affect the net income, they do not cause a change in a corporation's retained earnings. Instead, the current period's OCI items cause a change in accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a different component of stockholders' equity.
Examples of Other Comprehensive Income
Some examples of the items classified as other comprehensive income include:

Unrealized gains/losses on hedge/derivative financial instruments
Foreign currency translation adjustments
Unrealized gains/losses on postretirement benefit plans",what
What is discount on bonds payable?,"Discount on bonds payable (or bond discount) occurs when bonds are issued for less than their face or maturity amount. This is caused by the bonds having a stated interest rate which is lower than the market interest rate for similar bonds.
To illustrate the discount on bonds payable let's assume that a corporation will be issuing bonds with a maturity amount of $5,000,000 and a stated interest rate of 6% per year. However, the bonds are actually issued when the market demanded 6.1%. Since the investors will insist on earning the market interest rate of 6.1% the investors will not pay the full $5,000,000. If we assume that investors pay $4,900,000 for the bonds, the difference of $100,000 will be recorded by the issuer as a debit to the contra liability account Discount on Bonds Payable.
Over the life of the bonds the debit balance in Discount on Bonds Payable will decrease as it is amortized to Interest Expense. The combination of the unamortized debit balance in Discount on Bonds Payable, the unamortized debit balance in Bond Issue Costs, and the $5,000,000 credit balance in Bonds Payable is the book value or carrying value of the bonds payable.",what
How do you account for bond issue costs?,"The costs associated with issuing bonds should be recorded in a contra liability account such as Bond Issue Costs. Over the life of the bonds you will need to systematically move the bond issue cost from the balance sheet to the income statement. Accountants refer to this as amortizing the costs.
Let's illustrate the amortization of bond issue costs by assuming the total of the bond issue costs were $24,000 and the bonds will mature in 10 years. Each month you would debit Interest Expense for $200 ($24,000 divided by 120 months) and would credit Bond Issue Costs for $200. The concept is to match the $24,000 cost to the accounting periods that are benefiting from the bonds having been issued.
Our discussion pertains to financial statement reporting and we are not familiar with income tax reporting. You should discuss the income tax treatment with your tax adviser.",what
What is leverage?,"In accounting and finance, leverage refers to the use of a significant amount of debt and/or credit to purchase an asset, operate a company, acquire another company, etc.
Generally the cost of borrowed money is much less than the cost of obtaining additional stockholders' equity. As a result, it is usually wise for a corporation to use some debt and leverage. Perhaps this is one of the reasons that leverage is also known as trading on equity.
Financial ratios such as debt to equity and debt to total assets are indicators of a corporation's use of leverage. In these ratios debt is the total amount of all liabilities (current and noncurrent). This means that a corporation's debt includes bonds payable, loans from banks, loans from others, accounts payable, and all other amounts owed.
In a related Q&A we illustrate how leverage can increase or decrease the returns on investments.",what
How is petty cash reported on the financial statements?,"Definition of Petty Cash
Petty Cash is a small amount of money that a company has available to pay small amounts without writing a company check. The money might be used to pay the mail carrier for postage due on an envelope being received, reimbursing an employee for a company errand, etc.
Reporting Petty Cash on the Financial Statements
The petty cash amount may appear as the first or second item listed in the current asset section of the balance sheet.  However, the petty cash amount might be combined with the balances in the other cash accounts and their total reported as Cash or as Cash and cash equivalents as the first current asset.",what
What is the difference between notes payable and notes receivable?,"A written promissory note is a note payable for the borrower and it is a note receivable for the lender. Hence, the promissory note is a liability for the borrower and it is an asset for the lender.
To illustrate, let's assume that Local Retailer borrows $20,000 from its bank and signs a promissory note. Local Retailer records $20,000 in its liability account Notes Payable and also records the $20,000 in its Cash account. The bank records the $20,000 promissory note in its asset account Notes Receivable and it records the $20,000 increase in its customer's checking account (which is a liability account on the bank's balance sheet).
Since the promissory note is a contract to pay interest at a specified date, it requires Local Retailer to report interest expense in each accounting period and to report interest payable for any interest owed at the end of an accounting period. The bank is required to report interest revenue in each accounting period and to report interest receivable for any interest it has earned but has not received as of the end of each accounting period.",what
Should inventories be reported at their cost or at their selling prices?,"Generally inventories are reported at their cost. A merchant's inventory would be reported at the merchant's cost to purchase the items. A manufacturer's inventory would be at its cost to produce the items (the cost of direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead).
However, if the net realizable value (NRV) of the inventory is less than the cost, the NRV will usually need to be reported on the balance sheet instead of the cost. Net realizable value is defined as the expected selling price in the ordinary course of business minus any costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. When the cost of the inventory is written down to its NRV, the amount of the write down is reported on the income statement. (In a few industries, such as gold mining and meatpacking, it is accepted practice to report the inventory at its net realizable value.)
Since the unit cost of items in inventory is likely to be changing (think inflation), the costs used for inventory reporting will be based on a cost flow assumption. For example, the FIFO cost flow assumption will result in the inventory being reported at the more recent costs, since the first costs are assumed to have been the first costs out of inventory. Under the LIFO cost flow assumption, the inventory will be valued at the older costs, since the more recent costs are assumed to be the first costs to flow out of inventory.",what
What are the limitations of the balance sheet?,"One limitation of the balance sheet is that only the assets acquired in transactions can be included. Therefore, some of a company's most valuable assets will not be reported on the balance sheet. For example, assume that a company developed an internet business that now attracts millions of visitors each day and has $10 million in annual revenues. Since the internet business was not purchased from another company and its cost to develop was not significant, the company's balance sheet will include the business's cash, receivables and some related payables. However, the company's balance sheet will not be reporting the internet business at anywhere near the $30 million that the company was offered for the internet business.
Similarly, the immensely talented designers and content writers employed by an internet business cannot be reported as assets on the company's balance sheet since they were not acquired (and accountants are not able to compute a precise amount for these human resources). This is also the case for a company's reputation, its brand names that were developed through years of effective marketing, its customers' future demand for its unique services, etc.
Another limitation of the balance sheet pertains to a company's long-term (or noncurrent) assets which have increased in value since the time they were purchased in a transaction. For instance, a company's land will be reported at an amount no greater than its cost (due to the accountant's cost principle). Its buildings will be reported at their cost minus their accumulated depreciation (due to the cost principle and the matching principle). Hence, the amounts reported on the balance sheet for a company's land and buildings could be much lower than their market value.",what
Why is prepaid insurance a short term asset?,"Prepaid insurance is usually a short term or current asset because the prepaid amount will be used up or will expire within one year of the balance sheet date.
The definition of a short term or current asset is cash and other assets that will turn to cash or will be used up or consumed within one year of the balance sheet date. If a company's operating cycle is longer than one year, the definition allows for assets turning to cash, used up, or consumed during the operating cycle to be reported as a current asset.
Often companies are billed in advance for insurance premiums covering a one year period or less. Hence the prepaid amount is usually a current asset.
If a company would have to pay an insurance premium in advance for a period longer than one year, the portion of the prepayments that will not turn to cash within one year (or the operating cycle if it is longer than one year) would be reported as a long term asset.",what
What is the entry for the down payment from a signed contract?,"A down payment received before it is earned is recorded with a debit to the current asset account Cash and a credit to the current liability account Customer Deposits.
When the contract is completed, the account Customer Deposits will be debited for the amount of the down payment, the sale will be recorded with a credit, and Cash or Accounts Receivable will be debited.",what
Are bonds payable reported as a current liability if they mature in six months?,"Bonds payable that mature (or come due) within one year of the balance sheet date will be reported as a current liability if the issuer of the bonds must use a current asset or will create a current liability in order to pay the bondholders when the bonds mature.
However, the bonds could be reported as a long-term liability right up to the maturity date if:

The company has a sufficient, long-term investment that is restricted for the purpose of paying the bondholders when the bonds mature. This type of investment is known as a bond sinking fund.
The company has a binding agreement that guarantees that the existing bonds will be refinanced by issuing new bonds or by issuing shares of stock.",what
What is a valuation account?,"In accounting, a valuation account is usually a balance sheet account that is used in combination with another balance sheet account in order to report the carrying amount of an asset or liability.
An example of a valuation account that is associated with an asset is the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. This account's credit balance will be combined with the debit balance in Accounts Receivable in order to report the carrying amount of the company's accounts receivable. Other valuation accounts include Discount on Notes Receivable, Accumulated Depreciation, and allowance accounts used with inventory and investments.
Two examples of a valuation account associated with a liability are Bond Issue Costs and Discount on Bonds Payable. The debit balances in these valuation accounts will be combined with the credit balance in Bonds Payable in order to report the carrying amount of the bonds. Premium on Bonds Payable is a valuation account with a credit balance.",what
Why is the distinction between product costs and period costs important?,"The distinction between product costs and period costs is important to:

Properly measure a company's net income during the time specified on its income statement, and
To report the proper cost of inventory on the balance sheet

Definition of Product Costs
Product costs include the costs to manufacture products or to purchase products. If a product is unsold, the product costs will be reported as inventory on the balance sheet. When the product is sold, its cost is removed from inventory and will be included on the income statement as the cost of goods sold. Product costs are also referred to as inventoriable costs.
Examples of Product Costs
The product costs for a retailer will be the amount paid to the supplier plus any freight-in. Product costs for a manufacturer will be the direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead used to manufacture a product.
Definition of Period Costs
Period costs are expenses that will be reported on the income statement without ever attaching to products. Since they are not product costs, period costs will not be included in the cost of inventory. Instead, period costs will be referred to as period expenses since they will be reported on the income statement as selling, general and administrative (SG&A) or interest expenses.
Example of Period Costs
Selling expenses (such as commissions, salaries of sales employees, advertising), general and administrative (general office salaries, rent, utilities, etc.), and interest expense will be reported on the income statement when they are directly related to sales or when they are used up. For example, the insurance premiums that a company pays for nonmanufacturing protection will be expensed in the period in which the insurance premiums expire. (However, the insurance premiums for the manufacturing operations will become part of the product costs as the insurance premiums expire.)",what
Why does commitment and contingencies appear on the balance sheet without an amount?,"The term or caption commitment and contingencies appears near the end of a balance sheet without an amount in order to direct a reader's attention to the disclosures included in the notes to the financial statements.
An amount is not shown for a variety of reasons. For example, a chain of retail stores may have signed five-year, noncancelable leases to rent retail space for $1 million per year. This commitment needs to be disclosed to the readers of the balance sheet. However, if none of the $5 million is actually due as of the balance sheet date, there is no liability amount to be recorded in a liability account.
Another example of a commitment is an electric utility which has signed a noncancelable contract to purchase 100 million tons of coal during the following 10 years. This commitment also needs to be disclosed to the readers of the balance sheet. However, if none of the coal has been delivered as of the balance sheet date, the utility company will not report a liability since nothing is due as of the balance sheet date.
There are also some loss contingencies which are not recorded with amounts in the general ledger, but must be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. You can learn more about these contingencies by using the search box on AccountingCoach.com.",what
What causes a reduction in Accumulated Depreciation?,"The balance in the account Accumulated Depreciation will be reduced when an asset that has been depreciated is removed.
When an asset is sold, the depreciation expense is first recorded up to the date of the sale. Then the asset and its accumulated depreciation is removed and the proceeds are recorded.
Here's an example. A company has Equipment of $600,000 and Accumulated Depreciation of $380,000 before an item of equipment is sold. The original cost of the equipment being sold was $50,000. The first step is to record the current period's depreciation on that one item. Let's assume the depreciation will be $500. Let's also assume that after it is recorded, the item's accumulated depreciation will be $40,500. The company receives $5,000 for the equipment. The journal entry to record the disposal will consist of a debit to Cash for $5,000; a debit to Accumulated Depreciation for $40,500; a debit to Loss of Disposal of Asset for $4,500; a credit to Equipment for $50,000.
Prior to this transaction, the balance in the Accumulated Depreciation account was a credit balance of $380,000. The asset's current period depreciation of $500 increased the account's credit balance to $380,500. The disposal of the asset will reduce the balance in Accumulated Depreciation by $40,500 to a new balance of $340,000.",what
How do you record the sale of land?,"If a company sells land that it was holding for future use, the company will 1) debit Cash for the amount it receives, 2) credit Land for the amount in the general ledger account that applies to the land being sold, and 3) record the difference as a gain or loss on sale of land.
Since land does not get depreciated, there is no depreciation expense to be recorded up to the date of the sale, nor is there any accumulated depreciation to be removed from the books of the company.",what
What is the difference between the terms capitalize and depreciate?,"Capitalize refers to adding an amount to the balance sheet. For example, certain interest from loans to self-construct a building will be added to the cost of the building. The building's cost including the capitalized interest will be recorded as an asset on the balance sheet.
Depreciate refers to reducing an amount reported on the balance sheet. Depreciation is defined as systematically allocating the cost of a plant asset from the balance sheet and reporting it as depreciation expense on the income statement. If the building has a cost of $600,000 and a useful life of 30 years, then (assuming no salvage value and straight-line depreciation) each year $20,000 of cost is removed from the asset section of the balance sheet and will appear on the income statement as depreciation expense. (This in turn reduces owner's equity and keeps the balance sheet in balance.)
The interest on debt that is capitalized will not be expensed during the year of construction. Instead, it is added to the cost of the building (capitalized) and will be part of the annual depreciation expense occurring during the building's 30-year life.
In summary, capitalize means to add an amount to the balance sheet. Depreciate means to systematically remove an amount from the balance sheet during the asset's useful life.",what
Why is the accuracy of inventory valuation so important?,"Having an accurate valuation of inventory is important because the reported amount of inventory will affect 1) the cost of goods sold, gross profit, and net income on the income statement, and 2) the amount of current assets, working capital, total assets, and stockholders' or owner's equity reported on the balance sheet. In fact, an incorrect inventory valuation will cause two income statements to be incorrect. The reason is the ending inventory of one accounting period will automatically become the beginning inventory in the subsequent accounting period.",what
What is the effective interest rate for a bond?,"A bond's effective interest rate is the rate that will discount the bond's future interest payments and its maturity value to the bond's current selling price (current market price or present value). The effective interest rate is a bond investor's yield-to-maturity. It is also referred to as the market interest rate. The effective interest rate will likely be different from the stated or contractual rate that appears on the face of the bond.
The accounting profession requires that significant amounts of bond discount or premium be amortized by using the effective interest rate. Under this method, the effective interest rate (at the time the bonds were issued) is multiplied times the bond's carrying value. The result is the amount of interest expense for each reporting period. The difference between this expense and the actual interest paid will be the amount of discount or premium that is being amortized during the reporting period. The effective interest rate method ensures that the interest expense on the income statement will be directly related to the bond amounts on the balance sheet.",what
What is the difference between a note payable and a bond payable?,"For accounting purposes, a note payable and a bond payable are similar. That is, both are 1) written promises to pay interest and to repay the principal amount or maturity amount on specified future dates, 2) both are reported as liabilities, and 3) interest is accrued as a current liability.
If the bond or the note has its principal or maturity due within one year of the balance sheet date and the payment will cause a reduction in working capital, the bond or note will be reported as a current liability. If the bond or note will not be due within one year of the balance sheet date or if the maturity date is within one year but will not cause a reduction in working capital when it becomes due, it will be reported as a long-term liability. (For example, there may be a bond sinking fund or a formal agreement for refinancing the debt with new long-term debt or stock.)
Outside of accounting, I am certain there are differences. For example, debt with an original maturity date of less than a year is likely to be a note. However, some notes can be longer than one year. Government debt securities might be bills, notes, or bonds depending on the original maturity date of the debt security. Perhaps some notes do not specify interest.",what
What is a deferred credit?,"A deferred credit could mean money received in advance of it being earned, such as deferred revenue, unearned revenue, or customer advances. A deferred credit could also result from complicated transactions where a credit amount arises, but the amount is not revenue.
A deferred credit is reported as a liability on the balance sheet. Depending on the specifics, the deferred credit might be a current liability or a noncurrent liability. In the past, it was common to see a noncurrent liability section with the heading Deferred Credits.",what
"Under accrual accounting, how are worker comp premiums handled?","Worker comp insurance premiums should be charged to the areas where the related wages and salaries are charged.
Let's assume that the net cost of worker comp insurance after discounts and dividends is 5% of the wages and salaries of direct and indirect manufacturing employees. If for the month of January the direct labor is $40,000, then $2,000 of the worker comp cost should be included as direct labor. If indirect labor for January is $60,000 then $3,000 of worker comp cost should be included as the cost of the indirect labor.
If the general office worker comp rates are 0.2% of the general office wages and salaries, then 0.2% of January's general office wages and salaries will be expensed as worker comp insurance expense.
If the employer remits each month's worker comp cost to its insurance company each accounting period, there will be no prepaid insurance nor will there be a liability for accrued worker comp expense.
If the employer remits worker comp premiums to the insurance company in advance of the cost associated with wages and salaries, the amount that is prepaid as of the balance sheet date should be reported as Prepaid Insurance, a current asset. If the employer has remitted less than the worker comp cost associated with the wages and salaries, the amount owed to the insurance company as of the balance sheet date is reported as a current liability such as Accrued Worker Comp Payable.",what
Which financial statement tells the value of a business?,"None of the financial statements will report the value of a business. The main financial statements (balance sheet, income statement, statement of cash flows, statement of stockholders' equity) may provide some helpful partial information, but they will not report the value of the business.
Two reasons why the value of a business is not included in the financial statements are:

The financial statements are generally based on the company's past recorded transactions. The value of the business will more likely be based on the perceived future transactions.
The accountants' cost principle prohibits a business from reporting some highly-valued assets such as trademarks, brand names, and an effective management team (assuming these were developed internally).

A contemporary example which demonstrates that the financial statements do not reflect the value of a business is a startup company with a promising future. We may have read that a venture capitalist (VC) invested $10 million in a startup. Based on that investment the startup is assumed to have a total value of $100 million. Well the startup's financial statements will not report amounts anywhere near $100 million. Realistically the financial statements will be reporting negative earnings, few assets and little stockholders' equity. The company's value came from the VC's perception of the company's new breakthrough system that is projected to generate amazing future revenues with a limited amount of expenses.
In short, the financial statements provide only some of the information needed when attempting to determine the value of a business.",what
Why does our company's balance sheet report its land at cost when it is so much more valuable?,"Accountants are guided by the cost principle. This requires accountants to report assets at their cost when acquired—not their replacement cost or market value. The historical cost is an objective amount that can easily be audited. In contrast, the market value is subjective: one person thinks the land is worth $1 million while another thinks it's worth $1.5 million.
Further support for the cost principle is the accountants' going concern assumption. A company is assumed to be continuing in business and will not be liquidating. If your company bought the land for possible expansion, its cost is more relevant than the amount the company could get if it were liquidating. After all your company is not liquidating. The revenue recognition principle would be another reason why market values are not reported.
(P.S. I should add that some businesses are required to report assets at market value. I believe those businesses are in industries with significant markets and verifiable quoted market prices.)",what
What is the entry when a company lends money to an employee?,"When a company lends cash to one of its employees, the entry will include a credit to Cash and a debit to an asset account such as Notes Receivable from Employees (if a promissory note is involved) or Other Receivables-Advances to Employees (if a note is not involved).
When the company earns interest on the loan, the interest should be credited to Interest Revenue or Interest Income and should be debited to Interest Receivable or Cash.",what
What is the fixed asset turnover ratio?,"The fixed asset turnover ratio shows the relationship between the annual net sales and the net amount of fixed assets.
The net amount of fixed assets is the amount of property, plant and equipment reported on the balance sheet after deducting the accumulated depreciation. Ideally, you should use the average amount of net fixed assets during the year of the net sales.
A corporation having property, plant and equipment with an average gross amount of $10 million and an average accumulated depreciation of $4 million would have average net fixed assets of $6 million. If its net sales were $18 million, its fixed asset turnover would be 3 ($18 million of net sales divided by $6 million of average net fixed assets).",what
Can absorption costing cause an increase in net income?,"Absorption costing could result in an increase in net income if a company increases its production and its inventory. This occurs because fixed manufacturing overhead is allocated to more production units—some of which will be reported as inventory.
To illustrate, let's assume that a company has no beginning inventory and it has production plans for 100,000 units. Let's also assume that its annual fixed manufacturing overhead is $600,000. If 100,000 units are produced, the fixed manufacturing cost per unit will be $6 ($600,000 divided by 100,000 units). If the 100,000 units are sold for $20 each, the income statement will report sales revenues of $2,000,000 and its cost of goods sold will include $600,000 of fixed manufacturing overhead.
Now let's assume that the company decides to produce 120,000 units even though sales are expected to remain at 100,000 units. Because the fixed manufacturing overhead remains at $600,000 the cost per unit for fixed manufacturing overhead will be $5 ($600,000 divided by 120,000 units produced). In this case the company will report the same sales revenues of $2,000,000 (100,000 units sold times $20) but its cost of goods sold will include only $500,000 of fixed manufacturing overhead (100,000 units sold times $5). The company's balance sheet account Inventory will include $100,000 (20,000 units times $5) of the company's fixed manufacturing overhead.
As was illustrated above, the income statement will report a lower cost of goods sold when production and inventory increased. A smaller cost of goods sold will mean more gross profit and more net income.
Standard Costing: Fixed Manufacturing Overhead Variances
Income Statement: Manufacturer - Corporation, Multiple-Step",what
"Is the cost of land, buildings, and machinery a fixed cost?","Some people refer to land, buildings, and machinery as fixed assets. They are also referred to as plant assets, or as property, plant, and equipment.
The depreciation expense on the buildings and machinery is often viewed as a fixed cost or fixed expense. Hence, in the calculation of the break-even point, the annual depreciation expense on the fixed assets other than land is part of the fixed costs or fixed expenses. There is no depreciation of land.",what
How do I start a petty cash fund?,"To start a petty cash fund you need to open a general ledger account entitled Petty Cash. This will be an additional cash account that you could report either separately or have its balance included with other cash accounts when preparing a balance sheet.
Next you need to write a check for the amount that you believe is the amount needed for making small payments in your office. Let's assume that the amount will be $100. When processing the check you would indicate the account code for Petty Cash, so that the new account will be debited for $100.
You also need to designate one person to be the petty cash custodian. This person's name will be the payee of the $100 check. This person will then be accountable for the $100. At all times the custodian must have a combination of cash and petty cash receipts which add up to $100.
Just prior to issuing financial statements, the petty cash custodian should request cash for the petty cash receipts. This is known as replenishing the petty cash fund. This allows for the expenses to be included in the income statement and will result in the custodian having the $100 of cash that will be reported in the balance sheet. The custodian can also replenish the petty cash fund when there is little cash on hand due to a large amount of petty cash payments.",what
What is capital surplus?,"In the past, capital surplus was used to describe what is now referred to as paid-in capital in excess of par.
For example, when a corporation issues shares of its common stock and receives more than the par value of the stock, two accounts are involved: 1) the account Common Stock is used to record the par value of the shares being issued, and 2) the amount that is greater than the par value is recorded in an account entitled Paid-in Capital in Excess of Par—Common Stock, or Premium on Common Stock.
Many years ago, the account Paid-in Capital in Excess of Par—Common Stock and the account Premium on Common Stock were referred to as capital surplus.",what
What is meant by events after the balance sheet date?,"Events after the balance sheet date are significant financial events that occur after the date of the balance sheet, but prior to the date that the financial statements are issued. For example, a company's balance sheet that has the heading of December 31, 2012 might not be finalized and distributed until February 1, 2013. During January new information may arise that has financial significance. Perhaps there is an event that provides more information about the conditions actually existing on December 31. The second type of event would be a new January event that does not change the December 31 amounts, but needs to be disclosed to the readers of the December 31 financial statements.
An example of the first situation might be that a customer owes Jay Company $200,000 on December 31 and Jay Company assumed that the customer was financially sound. As a result Jay Company did not provide any allowance for the customer's account being uncollectible. Then on January 28, the customer filed for bankruptcy and Jay Company learns that none of the $200,000 receivable will be collected. If the customer's financial condition on December 31 was already in bankruptcy condition, Jay Company will need to adjust its December 31 balance sheet and its income statement for the year 2012 for this $200,000 of bad debts expense.
An example of the second situation might be a loss arising from a catastrophe occurring on January 16, 2013. The amounts reported as of December 31, 2012 will not be adjusted since those amounts were correct as of December 31. However, the readers of the December 31 balance sheet and the 2012 income statement should be informed through a disclosure that something significant has occurred to the company's financial position since December 31.
The events after the balance sheet date are often referred to as subsequent events or post balance sheet events.",what
"Are depreciation, depletion and amortization similar?","In accounting the terms depreciation, depletion and amortization often involve the movement of costs from the balance sheet to the income statement in a systematic and logical manner.
For example, the systematic expensing of the cost of assets such as buildings, equipment, furnishings and vehicles is known as depreciation. The systematic expensing of the cost of natural resources is referred to as depletion. The systematic expensing of other long-term costs such as bond issue costs and organization costs is referred to as amortization.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization are also described as noncash expenses, since there is no cash outlay in the years that the expense is reported on the income statement. As a result, these expenses are added back to the net income reported in the operating activities section of the statement of cash flows when it is prepared under the indirect method.
The term amortization is also used to indicate the systematic reduction in a loan balance resulting from a predetermined schedule of interest and principal payments.",what
Is it acceptable for companies to use two methods of depreciation?,"Yes, many companies use two or more methods of depreciation.
It is acceptable and common for companies to depreciate its plant assets by using the straight line method on its financial statements, while using an accelerated method on its income tax return.
A company could also be depreciating its equipment over ten years for its financial statements, while using seven years for its income tax return.
Even the depreciation for financial statements could consist of some assets being depreciated using the units of production or units of activity method, while other assets are depreciated using the straight line method.",what
"Is contributed capital a noncurrent asset or a current asset, and is it a debit or credit?","The account Contributed Capital is part of stockholders' equity and it will have a credit balance. Contributed capital is also referred to as paid-in capital.
When a corporation issues shares of its stock for cash, the corporation's current asset Cash will increase with the debit part of the entry, and the account Contributed Capital will increase with the credit part of the entry. If the corporation then uses some of its cash to purchase equipment, its current asset Cash will decrease and its noncurrent asset Equipment will increase.
If a corporation receives equipment in exchange for newly issued shares of stock, the noncurrent asset Equipment will increase and Contributed Capital will increase.",what
What is an asset account?,"Definition of an Asset Account
An asset account is a general ledger account used to sort and store the debit and credit amounts from a company's transactions involving the company's resources.
The balances in the asset accounts will be summarized and reported on the company's balance sheet.
Generally, the asset account balances are debit balances and are increased with a debit entry and decreased with a credit entry.
Examples of Asset Accounts
Some examples of asset accounts include Cash, Accounts Receivable, Inventory, Prepaid Expenses, Investments, Buildings, Equipment, Vehicles, Goodwill, and many more.
Two asset accounts, Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Accumulated Depreciation, are known as contra asset accounts since these accounts are expected to have credit balances.
Asset Accounts Are Permanent or Real Accounts
Asset accounts are referred to as permanent or real accounts since they are not closed at the end of the accounting year. Instead, each asset account's balance at the end of the accounting year is carried forward to become the beginning balance of the next accounting year.",what
What is the difference between reserve and allowance?,"More than 60 years ago, accountants in the U.S. used Reserve for Bad Debts as the title of the contra account associated with Accounts Receivable or Loans Receivable. They also used Reserve for Depreciation as the title of the contra account associated with plant assets. The use of the word reserve led some readers of the financial statements to conclude that money was set aside for replacing plant assets or the uncollectible accounts or loans. To avoid this misunderstanding, the accounting profession recommended that the word reserve have a very limited use. Accountants now use Allowance for Doubtful Accounts or Allowance for Bad Debts instead of Reserve for Bad Debts. In the case of plant assets, Accumulated Depreciation is used in place of Reserve for Depreciation.",what
What is an escrow payment?,"An escrow payment is an amount deposited with another party and it is to be released only for its specified purpose.  The following is one example of an escrow payment.
A borrower and lender arrange for the borrower's monthly mortgage payment to include an amount equal to one-twelfth of the property's annual real estate tax. Assuming the annual tax is $6,000 the monthly mortgage payment will include an escrow payment of $500. When the lender receives these monthly escrow payments of $500 each, the lender must hold them in escrow, or hold the funds in an escrow account. When the annual real estate taxes come due, the lender pays the real estate taxes by using the money in the borrower's escrow account.",what
What is accelerated depreciation?,"Accelerated depreciation is the allocation of a plant asset's cost in a faster manner than the straight line depreciation. Compared to straight line depreciation, accelerated depreciation will mean 1) more depreciation in the earlier years of an asset's life and 2) less depreciation in the later years of the asset's life. [Note that the total amount of depreciation over the asset's life will be the same regardless of the depreciation method used.] Hence, the difference between accelerated depreciation and straight line depreciation is the timing of the depreciation.
Three examples of accelerated depreciation methods include double-declining (200% declining) balance, 150% declining balance, and sum-of-the-years' digits (SYD).
The U.S. income tax regulations allow a business to use accelerated depreciation on its income tax return while using straight line depreciation on its financial statements. For profitable corporations this will likely result in deferred income tax payments being reported on its financial statements.",what
When will a transaction affect only one side of the accounting equation?,"Only one side of the accounting equation will be affected when one asset is used to acquire another asset or to replace another asset, when one liability replaces another liability, when stock is issued to replace a liability, when a cash dividend or stock dividend is declared. There are many other situations as well.
Here are some specific examples when only the left side of the accounting equation is affected. 1) A customer cannot pay an amount it owes and provides the company with a notes receivable. The company's asset Accounts Receivable will decrease and its asset Notes Receivable will increase. 2) A company prepays its insurance. As a result its asset Cash decreases and its asset Prepaid Insurance increases. 3) A company buys equipment for cash. The asset Cash decreases and the asset Equipment increases.
Here are some transactions that will affect only the right side of the accounting equation. 1) A company refinances its short-term debt with long-term debt. Short-term liabilities will decrease and long-term liabilities will increase. 2) A corporation issues common stock to replace its convertible bonds. The result is that liabilities decrease and stockholders' equity increases. 3) A corporation declares a cash dividend. A current liability Dividends Payable is created and the Retained Earnings (part of stockholders' equity) will decrease. 4) A stock dividend is declared. The paid-in capital section of stockholders' equity will increase and the retained earnings section will decrease.",what
What are wages payable?,"Definition of Wages Payable
Wages payable refers to the wages that a company's employees have earned, but have not yet been paid. Under the accrual method of accounting, this amount is likely recorded with an adjusting entry at the end of the accounting period so that the company's balance sheet will include the amount as a current liability. (The adjusting entry typically debits Wages Expense and credits Wages Payable.)
Example of Wages Payable
To illustrate wages payable we will use the following hypothetical dates and other information. Jane is an hourly-paid sales clerk at a company that ends its accounting year on December 31. During the work week of Sunday December 22 through Saturday December 28 Jane earned $400 of wages that the company will pay to her on January 2. For the last three days of the year (December 29-31) Jane earned $160. This amount (plus any wages she earns from January 1-4) will be included in her January 9 paycheck.
Given this information, the company has wages payable of $560 ($400 + $160) as of December 31.
Reporting Wages Payable on the Balance Sheet
The company's current liabilities on its December 31 balance sheet must include the $560 of wages payable that Jane had earned and the company owes as of December 31. (The company's income statement for the year that ends on December 31 must also report the $560 as part of its wages expense.)
The amount in the account Wages Payable (or Accrued Wages Payable) will often be reported on the balance sheet as part of a current liability description such as accrued compensation, accrued payroll liabilities, accrued expenses, accrued liabilities, etc.",what
What is a comparative balance sheet?,"A comparative balance sheet usually has two columns of amounts that appear to the right of the account titles or other descriptions such as Cash and Cash Equivalents, Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable, etc. The first column of amounts contains the amounts as of a recent moment or point in time, say December 31, 2012. To the right will be a column containing corresponding amounts from an earlier date, such as December 31, 2011. The older amounts appear further from the account titles or descriptions as the older amounts are less important.
Providing the amounts from an earlier date gives the reader of the balance sheet a point of reference—something to which the recent amounts can be compared.",what
What is a lien?,"A lien is a legal document filed by a creditor (lender) in order to record its claim on the debtor's (borrower's) property. The lien is recorded at a government's office. The lien provides a creditor with some protection or collateral until the debtor pays the creditor the amount owed.
Here are three examples of liens:

A bank may lend a retailer $50,000 but one of the conditions is that the bank will file a lien on the retailer's inventory. In this situation the bank's lien results in its loan becoming secured.
A mortgage is a lien filed by a lender in order to secure the lender's long-term real estate loan. The lien will require that the lender be paid the amount owed on the loan before the real estate can be transferred to another party.
The U.S. government may file a lien on a company's assets until a tax obligation has been paid.

A lien on a company's assets is to be disclosed in the company's financial statements.",what
Why does an inventory error affect two periods?,"An inventory error affects two periods because 1) the ending inventory of one period will become the beginning inventory for the following period, and 2) the calculation of the cost of goods sold is beginning inventory + purchases – ending inventory.
We will demonstrate this with some amounts. Let's assume that a company began on December 1. During the month of December it purchased or manufactured $100,000 of goods. At the end of December 31, the company reported that its ending inventory was $15,000. As a result, its balance sheet will report inventory of $15,000 and its income statement will report cost of goods sold of $85,000. In January it purchases $130,000 of goods and at the end of January 31 it reports inventory of $20,000. It will report January's cost of goods sold as $125,000 (beginning inventory of $15,000 plus purchases of $130,000 minus ending inventory of $20,000).
Now let's assume that only one error occurred and it involved the calculation of the December 31 ending inventory. Instead of the $15,000 that had been reported, the true amount of inventory was $19,000. That meant the December 31 balance sheet understated the true cost of inventory by $4,000. It also meant that the income statement's cost of goods sold was not $85,000. Rather, the true cost of goods sold was $81,000 ($100,000 minus $19,000 of inventory). In January, the true cost of goods sold is $129,000 (beginning inventory of $19,000 plus the purchases of $130,000 minus the January 31 inventory of $20,000).
To recap, the December 31 balance sheet reported the incorrect ending inventory and the December and January income statements reported the incorrect cost of goods sold, and gross profit and net income. The true cost of goods sold for December was $81,000—not the $85,000 that was reported. The true cost of goods sold for January was $129,000—not the $125,000 that was reported. That one error in calculating the December 31 inventory cost resulted in December's cost of goods sold being too high and January's cost of goods sold being too low. That in turn meant that the reported gross profit for December was $4,000 too low and January's reported profit was $4,000 too high.",what
What is the net book value of a noncurrent asset?,"The net book value of a noncurrent asset is the net amount reported on the balance sheet for a long-term asset.
To illustrate net book value, let's assume that several years ago a company purchased equipment to be used in its business. The equipment's cost was $100,000 and its accumulated depreciation as of its recent balance sheet date was $40,000. This means that up to the balance sheet date $40,000 of the asset's cost had been reported as Depreciation Expense. It also means that the equipment's net book value is $60,000 ($100,000 of cost minus $40,000 of accumulated depreciation). Net book value or simply book value indicates that $60,000 of the noncurrent asset's cost has not yet been charged to depreciation expense.
Net book value or book value can also be associated with noncurrent assets other than fixed assets. Two examples include long-term investments and unamortized bond issue costs.",what
What are common-size financial statements?,"Common-size financial statements present the financial statement amounts as a percentage of a base number. For example, the common-size income statement will report the revenue and expense amounts as percentages of net sales. The common-size balance sheet will report each asset, liability, and owner equity amount as a percentage of total assets.
Common-size financial statements allow you to compare the financial statements of large companies with the financial statements of smaller companies, because you are comparing percentages instead of dollars. For example, a small retailer can compare her cost of goods sold (perhaps 78%) to a much larger retailer's cost of goods sold (perhaps 80%). Similarly, one company's inventory might be 33% (of total assets) while a competitor's might be 28%.
Common-size financial statements are related to a technique known as vertical analysis.",what
Why will some asset accounts have a credit balance?,"A few asset accounts intentionally have credit balances. For instance, the account Accumulated Depreciation (which is a plant asset account) will have a credit balance since it is credited for the amounts that are debited to Depreciation Expense. The account Allowance for Bad Debts will have a credit balance for the amounts in Accounts Receivable that are not likely to be collected. The accounts Accumulated Depreciation and Allowance for Bad Debts are referred to as contra asset accounts because their credit balances are contrary to the expected debit balances found in most asset accounts.
There are also unexpected situations that result in asset accounts having credit balances. Here are five examples:

An error caused by posting an amount to an incorrect account.
Continuing to depreciate or amortize an asset after its balance has reached zero.
Receiving and posting an amount that was greater than the recorded receivable.
Expenses occurred faster than the agreed upon prepayments.
The amount of checks written exceeded the positive amount in the Cash account.

Before issuing the balance sheet, any errors (such as items 1 and 2) need to be corrected. The accounts with credit balances in items 3, 4, and 5 need to be reclassified to the liability section of the balance sheet.",what
Can a fully depreciated asset be revalued?,"A fully depreciated asset cannot be revalued because of accounting's cost principle.
Definition of a Fully Depreciated Asset
A fully depreciated asset is one that has accumulated depreciation equal to its cost. Hence, the book value of the asset is $0. Once an asset is fully depreciated, there will be no additional depreciation expense.
Example of a Fully Depreciated Asset
Let's assume that a company purchased a building more than 30 years ago at a cost of $600,000. The company then depreciated the building at a rate of $20,000 per year for 30 years. Today the building continues to be used by the company and it plans to continue using it for many more years. The company's current balance sheet will report the building at its cost of $600,000 minus its accumulated depreciation of $600,000 (a book value of $0) even if the building's current market value is $2,000,000.
Unless there are improvements to the building, there will be no depreciation expense after the 30th year.",what
Where is a contract with a customer reported on the balance sheet?,"A contract to perform future services for a customer is not reported on the balance sheet of the company that will be providing the services.  For example, if Company Jay and one of its customers sign a contract in December agreeing that Company Jay will deliver $20,000 of services beginning in January, the contract is not reported on Company Jay's December 31 balance sheet. (If the customer makes a deposit of $3,000 at the time of signing the contract, the $3,000 will be recorded by Company Jay in December with a $3,000 debit to Cash and a $3,000 credit to the liability account Customer Deposits or Unearned Revenues. With no downpayment or advance payment in December, there is no entry recorded.)
The $20,000 contract is not reported as an asset on Company Jay's December 31 balance sheet. The reason is that Company Jay has not earned any of the contract amount and therefore does not have a right or a receivable to the $20,000 as of December 31. Similarly, Company Jay's income statement for December and its December 31 owner's equity cannot include any earnings associated with the contract.",what
What is the return on assets ratio?,"The return on assets ratio, or return on total assets ratio, relates a company's after tax net income during a specific year, to the company's average total assets during the same year.
Let's assume that a company had $60,000 of net income after tax during a recent year. During the same 12 month period its total assets averaged $1,000,000. Its return on assets ratio for the year was 6% ($60,000 divided by $1,000,000).
You would compare this company's return on assets to other companies in the same industry.",what
What is the difference between an adjunct account and a contra account?,"Let's illustrate adjunct and contra accounts with bonds payable. If a corporation issues $100,000 of its bonds payable for a price of 97, it will be issuing the bonds at a discount of 3%. Its journal entry will include a debit to Cash for $97,000; a credit to Bonds Payable for $100,000; and a debit to Discount on Bonds Payable for $3,000. Discount on Bonds Payable is a contra account because it is a liability account with a debit amount. The carrying value of the bonds will begin at $97,000 since the $100,000 in Bonds Payable is offset by the $3,000 debit in Discount on Bonds Payable.
If a corporation issues $300,000 of bonds at a price of 102, it will be issuing the bonds at a premium of 2%. The journal entry will include a debit to Cash for $306,000; a credit to Bonds Payable for $300,000; and a credit to Premium on Bonds Payable for $6,000. Since a credit balance is the normal balance for a liability account, the account Premium on Bonds Payable cannot be referred to as a contra account. Here is where the term adjunct account is used. Immediately after the bonds are issued, the bonds will have a carrying value of $306,000 ($300,000 PLUS $6,000).
Some people might use the term adjunct accounts for both the Discount on Bonds Payable and for the Premium on Bonds Payable. Others might use the term valuation accounts.
Other examples of contra accounts include Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, Accumulated Depreciation, Discount on Notes Payable, Bond Issue Costs, Discount on Notes Receivable, LIFO Reserve, and certain investment accounts.",what
What is a mortgage loan?,"A mortgage loan is a loan with a lien on real estate so that the lender has collateral until the loan is repaid. On any given date, the borrower is liable for the unpaid principal balance plus any accrued interest expense up to that point. It is common for mortgage loans to require monthly interest and principal payments that will repay the principal balance over a number of years.
In accounting, the borrower's balance sheet will report a current liability for 1) the principal payments that will be coming due within one year after the balance sheet date, and 2) any accrued interest that is owed as of the balance sheet date. (Interest for future accounting periods is not reported as a liability.)
The borrower's balance sheet will also report a noncurrent liability for the difference between 1) the total unpaid principal balance owed as of the date of the balance sheet, minus 2) the principal payments that are reported as a current liability.
The lender's balance sheet will report a current asset and a noncurrent asset for the principal balance receivable and any accrued interest receivable. These amounts will be symmetrical to the amounts reported as liabilities on the borrower's balance sheet for the same date.",what
Why does a company's profit appear as a credit on its balance sheet?,"The accounting equation and the double entry system provide an explanation why a company's profit appears as a credit on its balance sheet.
Asset accounts usually have debit balances while liabilities and owner's or stockholders' equity usually have credit balances. When a company provides services for cash, its asset Cash is increased by a debit and its owner's equity is increased by a credit. The credit is initially recorded in a revenue account, but revenue accounts are temporary accounts that cause owner's equity to increase.
If the owner withdraws some cash for personal use, the asset Cash will decrease through a credit and the owner's equity will decrease through the debit part of the accounting entry. The debit might initially be recorded in the sole proprietor's Drawing account but this account is also a temporary account that will cause the owner's equity to decrease.
Generally speaking, the credit balance reported in the owner's or stockholders' equity section of the balance sheet reflects the owners' investments in the company plus the profits earned minus the amounts distributed to the owners since the time that the company began.",what
What is the transaction approach and balance sheet approach to measuring net income?,"The transaction approach to measuring net income is the traditional bookkeeping and accounting method. That is, individual transactions such as each sale, each purchase, and every expense are recorded into general ledger accounts. At any point you can go to an account such as Salaries Expense for Sales Staff and see the year to date amount of such an expense. With the use of accounting software, an enormous quantity of transactions can be recorded into many detailed accounts.
I believe that the balance sheet approach is also referred to as the capital maintenance approach. Under the balance sheet approach one looks at the change in stockholders' or owner's equity to determine the amount of net income during the period between balance sheets. This approach requires that you exclude any additional capital from the owners as well as any dividends or withdrawals distributed to the owners. For example, if stockholders' equity increased by $5 million with $2 million caused by the issuance of new shares of stock, and $1 million distributed as dividends, the net income would have been $4 million. We can verify the calculation with the following:  net income of $4 (an addition to equity) plus new investor money of $2 (an addition to equity) = $6 of additions to equity, minus dividends of  $1 (a decrease to equity) = $5 (the net increase to equity). Under this balance sheet approach you will not have the detailed information on revenues and expenses that would be available under the transaction approach.",what
What would cause a decrease in accumulated depreciation?,"A decrease in accumulated depreciation will occur when an asset is sold, scrapped, or retired. At that point, the asset's accumulated depreciation and its cost are removed from the accounts. (The net of these two amounts—known as the book value or carrying value—is then compared to the proceeds to determine if there is a gain or loss on the disposal.)
Some accounting textbooks state that the cost of an expenditure that extends the useful life of an asset should be debited to the accumulated depreciation account instead of the asset account. Such an entry will also reduce the credit balance in the accumulated depreciation account.",what
A corporation has a large balance in retained earnings. Does that mean that its dividends to stockholders will be increasing?,"Not necessarily. The balance in retained earnings means that the company has been profitable over the years and its dividends to stockholders have been less than its profits. It is possible that a company with billions of dollars of retained earnings has very little cash available today.
One possible explanation for the small amount of cash in relation to the retained earnings is that the company invested in new plant assets in order to expand its operations. Rather than distributing the company's cash to its stockholders, the company used the cash to pay for the factory and equipment in order to meet demand for its new product line.
Corporations might have a stated policy on dividends. For example, a corporation might pay dividends equal to approximately 40% of its earnings. Another corporation might have a plan to increase the amount of dividends each year by more than the rate of inflation. A new corporation might pay no dividends until its ratio of debt to equity is a specified percentage.",what
What is a provision for discounts allowable?,"The provision for discounts allowable is likely to be a balance sheet account that serves to reduce the asset account Accounts Receivable. The provision account's counter part (remember double entry accounting) is an income statement account, such as Sales Discounts or Discounts for xxx.
Let me give you an example from the meat industry. We had 40,000 pounds of beef without a local customer, so we sold it to a company 1,000 miles away for the local price of say $1.50 per pound. Our accounting entry was to debit Accounts Receivable $60,000 and to credit Sales $60,000. We also knew that the beef would shrink approximately 800 pounds as it traveled in the refrigerated truck and that the customer would deduct $1,200 (800 pounds X $1.50) when the customer processed and paid our invoice. In order to more accurately report our Accounts Receivables, our Net Sales and our weekly profit, I immediately made an entry to debit Discount for Shrinkage (a contra account to Sales) and a credit to Provision for Discounts (a contra account to Accounts Receivable). By recording that entry, our balance sheet would report the true amount to be collected, $58,800 ($60,000 invoiced minus the anticipated deduction of $1,200). The income statement would report that Sales minus the discount were only $58,800.
The provision account allowed our Accounts Receivable to agree with our sales invoices, yet the balance sheet would report the net amount that we would realistically receive. It allowed us to ""match"" the discount to the week of the sale and not mismatch the discount to a later week when the customer remitted the reduced amount.",what
What is a letter of credit?,"A letter of credit is a letter or document issued by a bank for use by one of its customers. The letter of credit states that the bank will guarantee payment up to the stated amount for transactions of its customer (named in the letter of credit).
The letter of credit is helpful if the bank's customer is traveling in countries where the customer is not known. The letter of credit will allow the customer to purchase goods on credit because the seller is assured of payment. In other words, the credit risk to the seller is greatly reduced because the seller can rely on the credit of the bank instead of the credit of the customer.
A letter of credit should not be confused with a line of credit.",what
What is the meaning of arrears?,"In accounting we use the word arrears in at least two ways. One use involves the omitted dividends on cumulative preferred stock. For example, if a corporation has cumulative preferred stock and due to a shortage of cash decides to omit the dividend on those preferred shares, the preferred dividend is in arrears. The result of having these dividends in arrears is that the owners of the common stock cannot receive a dividend until the preferred stock's dividends in arrears are paid and the preferred stock's current year dividend is also paid. Having dividends in arrears also requires a disclosure in the notes to the financial statements.
Arrears is also used in the context of annuities. When an annuity's equal payments occur at the end of each period, the annuity is said to be an annuity in arrears or an ordinary annuity.
Arrears is also used to simply mean past due, or behind in payments.",what
How should the cost of a yearly subscription for a newspaper be recorded?,"In theory, the payment in advance for a one-year subscription should initially be recorded as a debit to Prepaid Expenses and a credit to Cash. During the subscription period, you would debit Subscription Expense and would credit Prepaid Expenses. 
For example, if the annual subscription cost is $240 and it is paid in advance, you would initially debit Prepaid Expenses for $240 and credit Cash for $240. If your company issues monthly financial statements, then each month during the subscription period you would debit Subscription Expense for $20 and credit Prepaid Expenses for $20. This results in 1) the matching of $20 to expense on each of the monthly income statements, and 2) the balance sheet reporting the amount that is prepaid or not yet expired.
At a large company, the annual cost of $240 will usually be an immaterial amount. The materiality concept will allow you to violate the matching principle, and to avoid the monthly adjusting entry, by simply debiting Subscription Expense for the entire $240 at the beginning of the one-year subscription period.",what
What is a lease?,"A lease is usually a written agreement between an owner of property (land, building, equipment, vehicle, etc.) and a person or business that will use the property for a stated period of time at a specified series of payments.
The owner of the property is known as the lessor and the person using the property is the lessee.
Some leases are for short periods of time and there is no intention of transferring ownership of the asset in exchange for the rent payments. Two examples of this type of lease are 1) the lease for a one-bedroom apartment covering a 12-month period and rent payments of $1,100 per month, and 2) the lease of a new automobile for 24 months with payments of $300 per month.
Other leases may be for longer periods and ownership of the asset will transfer to the lessee for a small additional payment. An example is a noncancellable lease requiring 60 monthly payments of $600 per month for a forklift truck. At the end of the lease period (after the 60th payment) the lessee may take ownership of the forklift truck for an additional payment of $500.
Since leases are contracts requiring a series of payments, there is a question of how the lease and the related payments should be accounted for by the lessee and the lessor. As of September 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) were close to issuing a common financial accounting reporting standard that will replace the present U.S. accounting rules.",what
What if a company's Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is understated?,"When a company's Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is understated, the credit balance in this account is too small. This indicates that the company has reported too little of Bad Debts Expense and therefore too much net income.
Having a credit balance in the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts that is too small also means that the company is reporting too much for the following balance sheet items: net receivables, total current assets, working capital, total assets, and owner's equity.",what
What is the total asset turnover ratio?,"The total asset turnover ratio indicates the relationship of net sales for a specified year to the average amount of total assets during the same 12 months.
Let's assume that during a recent year a corporation had net sales of $2,100,000 and its total assets during the same 12 month period averaged $1,400,000. The company's total asset turnover for the year was 1.5 (net sales of $2,100,000 divided by $1,400,000 of average total assets).
This ratio will vary by industry, as some industries are more capital intensive than others. Always compare your company's financial ratios to the ratios of other companies in the same industry.",what
Which financial ratios are considered to be efficiency ratios?,"I consider the efficiency ratios to be the ratios also known as asset turnover ratios, activity ratios, or asset management ratios.
These efficiency ratios include 1) accounts receivable turnover ratio, and the related ratio days' credit sales in accounts receivable; 2) inventory turnover, and the related ratio days' cost of sales in inventory; 3) total asset turnover; and 4) fixed asset turnover.
The accounts receivable turnover ratio and the inventory turnover ratio are also used in the context of a firm's liquidity.
The total asset turnover and fixed asset turnover are indicators of a company's effectiveness in utilizing its assets.",what
How do I determine my payroll tax liabilities?,"Your payroll tax liabilities will include the following:

Federal, state, and local income taxes withheld from employees' wages, salaries, bonuses, etc. but not yet remitted.
The unremitted Social Security and Medicare taxes that were to be withheld plus your company's matching of those taxes.
State and federal unemployment taxes not yet remitted. Your state can tell you the rate for your company and the wages to which the rate applies. For example, it might be 5% on the first $9,000 of annual wages and salaries. The federal rate (after credit) is 0.6% on the first $7,000 of annual wages and salaries.

In addition to the payroll taxes, you may have payroll related liabilities for worker compensation insurance, health insurance, 401-k contributions, pensions, vacations, and so on.",what
What is a certificate of deposit?,"A certificate of deposit, also referred to as a CD, is a time deposit at a bank, credit union, or other financial institution. However, the certificate of deposit cannot be withdrawn until an agreed upon date known as its maturity date. If a withdrawal becomes a necessity, the financial institution will assess a penalty—usually the loss of interest.
A depositor will earn more interest on a certificate of deposit than the amount earned on a savings account or money market account. The length of a certificate of deposit could be one month, three months, six months, one year, 17 months, three years, etc. Generally the longer the time until maturity, the higher the interest rate.
A CD that matures in less than one year will be reported by the bank as a current liability, and will be reported as a short-term investment by the depositor (provided the amount is not restricted by the depositor).",what
The balance sheet and income statement are connected.,"In the tip of April 20, I mentioned that adjusting entries almost always involve both a balance sheet account and an income statement account. (For example, the cost of supplies that are no longer on hand is moved from the balance sheet to supplies expense on the income statement. Insurance premiums that are no longer prepaid are moved from the balance sheet to insurance expense on the income statement.) The first accounting course teaches us that the basic accounting equation is Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity. Owner's Equity or Stockholders' Equity is a section of the balance sheet that increases when the company's net income increases.
The point of these observations is the following tip: The number of balance sheet accounts is usually small in relation to the number of income statement accounts. If you can be certain that the relatively few balance sheet accounts have the correct ending balances, you can have some confidence that the bottom line of the income statement is proper. (The income statement may contain errors—perhaps you entered an amount into the wrong account—but the overall net income has a good chance of being correct.)
I received this tip from a CPA named Bob many years ago, when he helped me to delegate some accounting work. I continue to value his insight.",what
Are the sales taxes part of a retailer's sales?,"No. The sales taxes collected by a retailer are not part of its sales revenues. This means that the sales taxes collected by a retailer will not be reported on its income statement. Rather, the sales taxes collected are reported on the balance sheet as a current liability until they are remitted to the government.
To illustrate, let's assume that all of a retailer's products are subject to a state sales tax of 6%. If the retailer sells $500 of merchandise for cash, it will collect $530. This will be recorded with 1) a debit to Cash for $530, 2) a credit to Sales for $500, and 3) a credit to Sales Taxes Payable for $30. Note that the Sales account did not include the $30 of sales taxes.
When the retailer remits the sales taxes to the government, the liability account Sales Taxes Payable will be debited.",what
What is a deferred asset?,"A deferred asset represents costs that have occurred, but because of certain circumstances the costs can be reported as expenses at a later time. One of these circumstances is the assurance from an electric utility's regulators that the costs being deferred will be recoverable through increases in future utility rates.
To illustrate, let's assume that an electric utility spent $300,000 for a project before it had to be abandoned. The state regulators ruled that the utility may recover the $300,000 from its customers in the form of higher rates over a 5-year period starting next year. Because of this assurance, the utility can record the $300,000 as a deferred asset. In each of the five subsequent years, the utility will credit the deferred asset account for $60,000 and will debit an expense for $60,000. Hence, the $60,000 of increased expenses will be matched with the $60,000 of increased revenues on five annual income statements.
Deferred assets are also referred to as deferred charges, deferred costs, or deferred debits. For the example we used above, utilities will use the term regulatory assets.
The balance in a deferred asset account will be reported on the balance sheet as a current asset and/or as a noncurrent asset depending on the facts involved.",what
What is inflation accounting?,"In the U.S., inflation accounting has resulted in optional supplementary disclosures on the effects of 1) general inflation, and 2) changes in the prices of specific types of assets. In other words, the main financial statements continue to report only the traditional, historical cost amounts without any adjustment for changing prices. [During the years 1979 to 1985, some supplementary disclosures on the effects of changing prices had to be included in the notes to the financial statements of the very large U.S. corporations. From 1986 until today, the supplementary disclosures are optional. Hence, the disclosures are not likely to be made.]
One reason that inflation accounting is now optional for U.S. corporations is that the U.S. inflation rate has been modest or low since 1983. Another reason is the belief that the cost of computing the disclosure amounts will be greater than the benefit to the readers of the financial statements.
To illustrate the logic of inflation accounting, let's assume that the general inflation rate and the changes in the costs of specific assets are increasing at a constant rate of 10% each year. This means that a power plant built for a cost of $1 billion will cost $10 billion at the end of a useful life of 25 years. By computing straight-line depreciation based on the historical cost, the income statement will report depreciation expense of $40 million per year ($1 billion/25 years). Obviously this is much lower than the current cost of the productive capacity being used up each year.
Similarly, if a retailer's cost of items in inventory is increasing at an annual rate of 10%, the cost of goods sold reported on the income statement (based on historical costs) will be less than the cost the company will spend in order to replace the units sold.
The use of historical costs during periods of increasing prices means that companies with large amounts of plant assets and inventory will be reporting net income that is greater than the true economic profit. As a result, the reported net income during inflationary periods is said to include illusory profit.",what
What is a contra inventory account?,"A contra inventory account is a general ledger account with a credit balance. The credit balance in the contra inventory account will be combined with the debit balance in the inventory account when a balance sheet is prepared.
If a company's inventory has a net realizable value (NRV) that is less than the cost of the inventory, it may choose to keep the original costs in its Inventory account and to reduce the reported amount of inventory through a contra inventory account such as Allowance to Reduce Inventory to NRV. For example, if the Inventory account has a debit balance of $40,000 for the cost of the goods on hand at a balance sheet date, but the net realizable value is only $37,000, the Allowance account will be adjusted to show a credit balance of $3,000.",what
How do you calculate ending inventory?,"Physically Counting the Items in Inventory
One method for calculating the cost of a company's ending inventory is to 1) physically count the quantity of each of the items in inventory and then 2) multiply those quantities by each item's actual unit cost.
The actual unit costs must be consistent with the cost flow assumption (FIFO, weighted-average, etc.) that was elected by the company. Special attention is required for items that are on consignment or are in transit. Taking the physical counts can be very time consuming and complicated especially when inventory items are moving between operations. As a result, large companies are likely to physically count the inventory items only at the end of the accounting year.
Using the Quantities in the Company's Inventory System
A second method which can be used for interim financial statements is to calculate the ending inventory by using the quantities on the company's inventory system. Those quantities are multiplied by the actual unit costs that reflect the company's cost flow assumption. (Throughout the year the inventory system's quantities should be adjusted to agree with any physical counts. Some companies will physically count a different group of inventory items each month and compare those counts to the system's quantities.)
Estimating the Cost of the Ending Inventory
A third approach is to use the gross profit method to calculate the estimated cost of the ending inventories that will be used on the interim financial statements.",what
Are liabilities always a bad thing?,"Liabilities are obligations and are usually defined as a claim on assets. However, liabilities and stockholders' equity are also the sources of assets. Generally, liabilities are considered to have a lower cost than stockholders' equity. On the other hand, too many liabilities result in additional risk.
Some liabilities have low interest rates and some have no interest associated with them. For example, some of a company's accounts payable may allow payment in 30 days. With those payables it is better to have the liability and to keep your cash in the bank until they become due.
In our personal lives, our first house was probably purchased with a down payment and mortgage loan. That mortgage loan was a big liability, but it allowed us to upgrade our living space. I viewed my mortgage loan liability as a good thing because it allowed me to own a nice home in a beautiful neighborhood.
So some liabilities are good—especially the ones that have a very low interest rate. Too many liabilities could cause financial hardships.",what
"If a mortgage payment is due by December 31, but the payment is not made until the following month, should the loan payment be accrued at December 31?","The interest portion of the mortgage payment should be accrued as of December 31 under the accrual method of accounting. In other words, there needs to be an adjusting entry dated December 31 to debit Interest Expense and to credit Interest payable for the amount of interest owed as of December 31.
The principal balance on the mortgage loan already appears in the general ledger and on the balance sheet as the liability Mortgage Loan Payable. Therefore, there is no accrual needed for the principal portion of the loan payment due at December 31.",what
Why aren't retained earnings distributed as dividends to the stockholders?,"A corporation's earnings are usually retained instead of being distributed to the stockholders in the form of dividends because the corporation is in need of money to strengthen its financial position, to expand its operations, or to keep up with the inflation in its present size of operations.
The stockholders may prefer to forego dividends in order to see its stock value increase from the corporation's wise use of the retained earnings. This is especially true of  U.S. individuals in high federal and state  income tax brackets. These stockholders might end up paying 40% of the dividend amount in income taxes. They would rather have their stock appreciate in value with no tax payments and later sell their shares of stock at the lower capital gains tax rates.",what
What is Form 10-K?,"Form 10-K is a corporation's annual report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Form 10-K is required for U.S. corporations whose stock is publicly traded.
Form 10-K contains a wealth of information on the corporation in general such as its products, sales, markets, risks, officers, directors, and more. A significant portion of the Form 10-K is entitled Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. Another major section is Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. You will learn much about the corporation and about accounting by reading a corporation's entire Form 10-K. (In other words, don't skip the notes to the financial statements.)
A corporation's Form 10-K is usually available from each corporation's website (usually under Investor Relations). You can also access and download the SEC reports at no cost from http://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/webusers.htm.",what
Why isn't a key employee reported as an asset on the balance sheet?,"While an employee could be an organization's most valuable asset, accountants record past transactions that can be measured.
Since an employee is not purchased, there is no past transaction and cost that the accountant can record in order to report this person as an asset owned by the entity. The salary and bonuses paid to a key employee are reported as expenses in the period in which the employee performed services.
Not being able to record a valuable employee as an asset is similar to a valuable brand name developed internally by a company over time. Since the brand name was not purchased from another entity, there is no past transaction and purchase cost to be recorded.
I assume that an entity's payment made to another professional sports team for a professional athlete's services for the next three years will result in recording the payment as an asset—a prepaid expense or deferred charge—that will then be amortized to expense over the three year contract.",what
Is the sales tax on merchandise purchased for resale included in inventory?,"In our state, sales tax is paid only by the end customer. In other words, a retailer does not pay sales tax on merchandise that is purchased for resale. To avoid the sales tax, the retailer furnishes the supplier with a reseller's certificate, which allows the supplier to not charge the sales tax.
If a sales tax is paid by the reseller and the sales tax could have been avoided, the sales tax would have to be expensed immediately. Costs that are not necessary cannot be recorded as assets.
If the sales tax could not have been avoided, then the sales tax would be part of the cost of the merchandise purchased. If the merchandise has not been sold, the entire cost will be reported as inventory, a current asset on the balance sheet. If the merchandise has been sold, then the entire cost will be reported on the income statement as the cost of goods sold.",what
Is an automobile loan payment an expense?,"Only the interest portion of an automobile loan payment is an expense. The principal portion of the loan payment is a reduction of the loan balance, which is reported as a Note Payable or Loan Payable in the liability section of the balance sheet.
Expressed another way, an automobile loan payment consists of two components: an interest payment and a principal payment. While the loan payment is a cash outflow or an expenditure, only the interest portion is an expense that will be reported on a company's income statement.",what
Are fixed assets the same as plant assets?,"I use the term fixed assets to mean the same as plant assets. In other words, I believe that both fixed assets and plant assets refer to the assets reported on the balance sheet as Property, Plant and Equipment.",what
What accounts for the difference in inventory values between periodic LIFO and perpetual LIFO?,"The difference between periodic LIFO and perpetual LIFO involves the time at which costs are removed from inventory. Under periodic LIFO, the latest costs are assumed to be removed from inventory at the end of the year. Under, perpetual LIFO the latest costs are assumed to be removed from inventory at the time of each sale.
We will illustrate the difference by using the following information. A company's accounting year is January 1 through December 31 and the company sells only one type of product. In its beginning inventory are 2 units with a cost of $10 each. The company sells 1 unit on March 1. On April 1, the company purchases 5 units at a cost of $11 each. On September 1, the company sells 3 units. In summary, the company had 2 units on January 1, purchased 5 units on April 1, sold 4 units during the year, and has 3 units on hand at December 31.
Under periodic LIFO, the costs of the latest purchases starting with the end of the year are removed first. Since 4 units were sold during the year, the costs removed from inventory and charged to the cost of goods sold will be the latest cost of 4 units, which is $11 each. This means the cost of its December 31 inventory under periodic LIFO will be $31 (1 unit at $11 plus 2 units at $10).
Under perpetual LIFO, the costs of the latest purchases as of the date of each sale are removed first. On March 1, the latest cost at that time for the 1 unit sold was $10. At the time of the sales on September 1, the latest costs of the 3 units sold was $11 each. Under perpetual LIFO its cost of goods sold will be $43 (1 at $10 and 3 at $11), and its inventory will be reported at a cost of $32 (2 units at $11 and 1 unit at $10).",what
Does the income statement explain the change in the equity section of a balance sheet?,"The income statement could explain the change in the equity section of a balance sheet. However, there are likely to be some other explanations as well.
Here is a list of the items that would cause an increase in the total amount of a corporation's stockholders' equity:

Positive net earnings or net income reported on the corporation's income statement.
Some positive Other Comprehensive Income items occurred but they are not to be reported on the income statement.
Additional shares of stock were issued in exchange for cash or other assets.
Donated capital was received.

Here is a list of items that could cause a decrease in the total amount of a corporation's stockholders' equity:

Negative net earnings or a net loss reported on the corporation's income statement.
Some negative Other Comprehensive Income items occurred but they are not to be reported the income statement.
The corporation declared cash dividends.

To see all of the explanations for the change in the equity section of a balance sheet, you should review the statement of stockholders' equity. This financial statement should be issued along with a corporation's balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows.",what
What is net working capital?,"Definition of Net Working Capital
Net working capital is the amount (as opposed to being a ratio) remaining after subtracting a company's total amount of current liabilities from its total amount of current assets. Hence, the formula is: net working capital = current assets minus current liabilities. (Net working capital is also known as working capital.)
Example of Net Working Capital
As an example, a company with current assets of $130,000 and current liabilities of $100,000 has $30,000 of net working capital. This amount may be sufficient for some companies but inadequate for other companies.
Difference Between Net Working Capital and Liquidity
Net working capital is often cited as one of the indicators of a company's liquidity. However, the amount of net working capital alone does not assure a company of the liquidity necessary to pay its current liabilities when they come due. For example, if a company's current assets consist mainly of slow-moving inventory and some slow-paying accounts receivable, the company may not be able to convert its current assets to a sufficient amount of cash in time to pay its obligations. Not having sufficient cash to pay employees, suppliers and other creditors may lead to serious problems.
In contrast, another company that sells fast-moving products online with customers paying with credit cards will have liquidity even with a small amount of net working capital. If this company's suppliers also have credit terms of net 60 days or the company pays its bills by using its business credit card, the company may be able to operate with negative working capital.
Managing Working Capital
In short, net working capital management is critical for a company's positive relationships with lenders, suppliers, employees and customers. All of the components of net working capital should be examined in detail and managed properly.",what
Why do companies use cost flow assumptions to cost their inventories?,"Cost flow assumptions are necessary because of inflation and the changing costs experienced by companies. If costs were completely stable, it wouldn't matter how costs were flowed.
To illustrate the cost flow assumption, let's assume that a company's product had a cost of $100 at the start of the year, at mid-year the cost was $105, and at the end of the year the cost was $110. Which cost would you match with the sale of one item at the end of the year? Would you match the $100 cost with the selling price of the unit sold? (If so, you are assuming a FIFO cost flow.) Would you match the $110 cost with the sale? (That's the LIFO cost flow assumption.) If you would matched the average of $105, you would be using the weighted-average cost flow assumption.
The cost flow assumption will also affect the inventory values. If you matched the $100 cost with the sale, the company's inventory will have the higher costs. If you matched the $110 cost with the sale, the company's inventory will have lower costs. The weighted-average cost would mean that both the inventory and the cost of goods sold would be valued at $105 per unit.
You must also realize that the cost flow assumption is independent of the physical flow of the products. This means you can rotate your company's inventory (by selling its oldest units first) and yet flow the costs by using LIFO or weighted average.
Many U.S. companies have switched their cost flow assumption from FIFO to the LIFO because they were experiencing rising costs. By flowing the recent higher costs into the cost of goods sold on the income statement and tax return (and keeping the older lower costs in inventory), they are reporting a more realistic net income and less taxable income.",what
What is a limitation of the inventory turnover ratio?,"One limitation of the inventory turnover ratio is that it tells you the average number of times per year that a company's inventory has been sold. For example, if during the past year a company had sales of $7 million, cost of goods sold of $5 million, and its inventory cost averaged $1 million, the company's inventory turnover was on average 5 ($5 million of cost of goods sold divided by $1 million of inventory cost). A turnover ratio of 5 indicates that on average the inventory had turned over every 72 or 73 days (360 or 365 days per year divided by the turnover of 5).
However, the average turnover ratio of 5 might be hiding some important details. What if four items make up 40% of the company's sales and account for only 10% of the inventory cost? These fast selling items will have a turnover ratio of 20 (cost of goods sold of $2,000,000 divided by their average inventory cost of $100,000) meaning these items turn every 18 days (360 days divided by the turnover of 20). This means that the remaining items in inventory will have a cost of goods sold of $3,000,000 and their average inventory cost will be $900,000. As a result, the majority of the items in inventory will have an average turnover ratio of 3.3 ($3,000,000 divided by $900,000). In other words, the majority of items are turning on average every 109 days (360 days divided by the turnover ratio of 3.3). That's a significant difference from the 72 days that we first computed on the totals.
People within the company can overcome the shortcomings described above, since they have access to all of the sales and inventory detail. A computer generated report can compute the inventory turnover ratio and the days' sales in inventory for each and every item sold and/or held in inventory. By reviewing each item, the slow moving items will not be hidden behind an average.",what
Why is a negative cash balance reported as a liability?,"The following will illustrate why a negative cash balance is reported as a liability instead of being reported as a negative asset amount.
Company X writes checks for more than its bank balance and sends them to its vendors. When the checks get back to Company X's checking account, Company X's bank will have two options when Company X's checking account does not have sufficient funds to cover the checks:
1. The bank could pay the checks and allow Company X's checking account to be overdrawn. (Some call this an unauthorized loan by the bank.) Company X then has the obligation or liability to repay the bank for the courtesy extended to Company X.
2. If Company X's bank does not pay the checks because the account has insufficient funds, the bank will return the checks as NSF (not sufficient funds). These checks are returned through the banking system and eventually the bank of the payee will take the amount of the check from the payee's checking account. The payee will in turn reinstate the liability amount owed to it by Company X. In essence Company X did not eliminate its liability to the payee by issuing a worthless check.
Hopefully these two bank options illustrate why accountants will report a negative cash balance as a liability.
By the way, checks not paid by the bank on which they are drawn are said to have ""bounced"" or are called ""rubber checks"" since they are bounced back through the banking system by the bank on which they were drawn.",what
What is the rationale for not reporting plant assets at their liquidation value?,"I will assume that the plant assets' liquidation values are higher than the present carrying values when answering your question.
Plant assets (buildings and equipment used in manufacturing; also called fixed assets) are not reported at their higher liquidation value because of several accounting principles. Below are four accounting principles that come to mind.
The cost principle requires that plant assets be reported at amounts that are not greater than cost. Cost is an objective and verifiable amount. Liquidation value is subjective and the amount can vary significantly depending on the assumptions made.
The matching principle requires that the cost of plant assets be allocated to depreciation expense. This means that over a plant asset's useful life some of the plant asset cost is matched with revenues on the income statement. Therefore the plant asset's carrying amount will be decreasing each period.
The going concern assumption implies that the company will be continuing in business. Since it is assumed that the company is not liquidating, the liquidation value of the plant assets is not relevant.
The revenue recognition principle prohibits a company from showing a gain from merely holding a plant asset. What would you credit if you increased the plant asset amount?
Those four accounting principles provide some of the rationale for not reporting the liquidation value when it is higher than cost.
If a company is not a going concern or if the plant asset's value has been impaired, the above rationale does not hold. For those situations you will need to follow the appropriate accounting rules.",what
How do you record the sales tax on the purchase of an asset?,"Accountants define the cost of an asset as all of the costs that are necessary to obtain the asset and to get it ready for use.
If your state does not allow an exemption from sales tax for the asset you purchased, the sales tax should be recorded as part of the cost of the asset.",what
How does the aging of accounts receivable determine bad debts expense?,"The aging of accounts receivable allows you to quickly identify the credit customers that are past due and the length of time that the amounts have been past due. Focusing on the past due accounts receivable will assist you in estimating how much of the accounts receivable will never be collected.
The estimated amount of accounts receivable that will never be collected should be the credit balance in the general ledger account  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. This credit balance when combined with the debit balance in Accounts Receivable will mean that the amount that is likely to be collected will be reported on the balance sheet.
When the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is credited to increase its balance, the entry will debit the general ledger account Bad Debts Expense.",what
What is accumulated other comprehensive income?,"Accumulated other comprehensive income is a separate line within the stockholders' equity section of the balance sheet. This line accumulates the effects of items known as other comprehensive income, which are reported in each period's statement of comprehensive income. It is analagous to retained earnings which is accumulating the revenues and expenses that are reported on each period's income statement. 
Some examples of the items which comprise accumulated other comprehensive income include:

Unrealized gains/losses on hedge/derivative financial instruments
Foreign currency translation adjustments
Unrealized gains/losses on postretirement benefit plans

In short, the above examples will impact the balance sheet and the statement of comprehensive income. However, the examples will not affect net income, the income statement, or retained earnings.",what
What is the periodic inventory system?,"Definition of Periodic Inventory System
The periodic inventory system does not update the general ledger account Inventory when a company purchases goods to be resold. Rather than debiting Inventory, the company debits the temporary account Purchases. Any adjustments related to these purchases of goods will be credited to a general ledger contra account such as Purchases Discounts or Purchases Returns and Allowances. When the balances of these three purchases accounts are combined, the resulting amount is known as net purchases.
When goods are sold under the periodic inventory system there is no entry to credit the Inventory account or to debit the account Cost of Goods Sold. Hence, the Inventory account contains only the ending balance from the previous year. As a result, the company must compute an inventory amount at the end of each accounting period in order to report the amount of its ending inventory for its balance sheet and the cost of goods sold for its income statement.
Computing the Inventory Amount Under the Periodic Inventory Method
At the end of an accounting year, the company's ending inventory is normally computed based on a physical count of its inventory items. However, the inventory amounts for the monthly and quarterly financial statements are usually estimates. Under the periodic inventory system the cost of goods sold is computed as follows: beginning inventory (previous year's ending inventory cost) + net purchases = cost of goods available - costs computed for the ending inventory = cost of goods sold. An alternative format is: net purchases plus the decrease in inventory or minus the increase in inventory = cost of goods sold.
Inventory Records Outside of the General Ledger
It should be noted that companies using the periodic inventory system in their general ledger accounts often have sophisticated inventory systems outside of the general ledger for tracking the items it purchases, produces, sells and has on hand.",what
What is the difference between liquidity and liquidation?,"Liquidity usually refers to a company's ability to pay its bills when they become due. Liquidity is often evaluated by comparing a company's current assets to its current liabilities. Working capital, the current ratio, and the quick ratio are referred to as liquidity ratios or short-term solvency ratios , since their calculations use some or all of the current assets and the current liabilities. Sometimes a company's accounts receivable turnover ratio, inventory turnover ratio, and free cash flow are also used to assess a company's liquidity.
Liquidation is a term commonly used when a company sells parts of its business for cash, or when it sells assets in order to pay debts. Liquidation may also involve the winding down or the closing of a business.",what
Is the current portion of long term debt adjusted monthly?,"A monthly adjustment to the current portion of long term debt is necessary when:
1. the company issues monthly balance sheets, and
2. the amount to be paid on a loan's principal balance during the next 12 months is different from the amount presently shown as a current liability.
The amount reported as a current liability plus the amount reported as a long term liability must be equal to the total amount owed on the debt.",what
"When calculating inventory turnover, do you use sales or the cost of goods sold?","I calculate the inventory turnover by using the cost of goods sold. I use the cost of goods sold because inventory is in the general ledger at its cost and it is reported on the balance sheet at cost. Since inventory is the cost of goods on hand, it makes sense to relate it to the cost of goods sold.
Assume that during the past year a company's inventory had an average cost of $10,000. (This was the average of the amounts in the asset account Inventory and the average of the amounts reported on the balance sheet during the past year.) Also assume that during the year the company has sales of $60,000 and its cost of goods sold was $40,000. On average, the inventory turned over 4 times ($40,000 of cost of goods sold during the year divided by $10,000 the average cost of goods on hand during the year.)",what
What is a burden rate in inventory?,"I assume that the burden rate in inventory refers to a manufacturer's indirect manufacturing costs, which are also referred to as factory overhead, indirect production costs, and burden. In the U.S., a manufactured product's cost consists of direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead. Since manufacturing overhead is an indirect cost, it is usually assigned or allocated through an overhead rate or burden rate. Two examples of an overhead or burden rate are 1) a percentage of direct labor, and 2) an hourly cost rate assigned on the basis of machine hours.
A product's manufacturing cost, consisting of direct materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead, is used to report the cost of goods sold and also the cost of units in inventory. Therefore, if you look at the detail of a product's inventory cost, you may see the manufacturing overhead being assigned or applied to the unit through a burden rate.",what
Does the accrual method apply to the purchase of equipment?,"The accrual method does apply to the purchase of equipment (as well as applying to revenues and expenses).
To illustrate, let's assume that on December 29 a company ordered and received some equipment to be used in its operations. The payment for the equipment is to be made on February 10. Under the accrual method, on December 29 the company should debit the asset account Equipment and credit the liability account Accounts Payable. (When the supplier or vendor is paid on February 10, the company's asset Cash will be credited and its liability account Accounts Payable will be debited.)",what
Why are some plastic cards called debit cards?,"I assume the name debit card relates to the reduction in the cardholder's checking account balance at the time that the card is used. The checking account balances of a bank's customers are liabilities for the bank. When the cardholder uses his or her debit card, the bank's liability account such as Customer Checking Accounts or Demand Deposits will be reduced. To reduce the normal credit balance in the bank's liability account, a debit entry is required.
The name debit card also helps to distinguish it from a credit card. The use of a credit card means that the bank (or other financial institution) is making a loan or providing credit to the cardholder. Usually the cardholder will receive a monthly statement showing the credit card transactions and must remit at least a portion of the amount owed within a stated amount of time. The bank will also charge interest on the unpaid balances.",what
Should receipts be recorded using the date the money was received or the date the money was deposited in the bank accounts?,"Cash receipts should be recorded with the date the money was received. For example, a church collects money during each of its services on Sunday, June 4.
On Monday, June 5, the money is counted and is deposited into the church's bank account. The transaction to record the cash and the revenues (remember double entry) should be dated Sunday, June 4, since that is the day of the transaction—the day the church received the money.
The day the money is deposited into the bank account is not the proper date of the transaction. The accounting records should report that the money was received on Sunday, June 4.",what
What if an employee's actual vacation payment is greater than the amount that has been accrued?,"Let's assume that a company's accounting year ends on December 31 and the company has only one employee who worked the full year. The company's handbook specifies that the employee earns 10 hours of vacation for each month worked. However, the vacation hours for the year accumulate. The total vacation hours earned as of December 31 will be paid to the employee on June 1 of the following year by using the employee's June 1 pay rate.
Next, let's assume that each month the company records an accrual adjusting entry that debits Vacation Expense for $200 (10 hours X $20 per hour) and credits Vacation Liability for $200. As a result, the balance in the balance sheet account Vacation Liability at December 31 is $2,400 (12 months X $200, or 120 hours X $20).
On the following June 1, the employee's pay rate is $20.50 which means the employee's gross vacation pay will be $2,460 (120 hours X $20.50). The June 1 journal entry to record the vacation payment is:

Debit Vacation Payable $2,400 (to eliminate the December 31 liability)
Debit Vacation Expense $60
Credit Cash, Payroll Withholdings, etc. for a total of $2,460

Note that the $60 difference was recorded as Vacation Expense in the year of the payment. The financial statements of the prior year were not restated for the $5 monthly differences. The reason is the prior year's monthly amounts were estimates (not mistakes) and the difference is immaterial.",what
"If a company issues stocks or bonds to pay outstanding debt, should this noncash transaction be included in the cash flow statement?","If a company issues stocks or bonds for cash and then pays off the debt, the transaction is reported in the financing section of the statement of cash flows.
If the transaction is a direct conversion of debt to equity (shares of stock) or debt to bonds and no cash receipts or cash payments occur, the transaction is to be disclosed as supplementary information.
This situation and other noncash financing and investing activities are described in Paragraph 32 of the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows, available at www.FASB.org/st.",what
How do I record exterior cement work? Is it an asset or an expense?,"If the cement work was done to repair or maintain existing cement work, then the expenditure should be recorded as an expense. Even if the cost is very large, repairs and maintenance must be expensed. The cost of repairs or maintenance cannot be recorded as an asset.
If the cement work is an addition or an improvement (more than repairing or maintaining existing cement work), the cost of the cement work is viewed as a new asset. If the amount is significant, you should record the expenditure as an asset and then depreciate the cost over the useful life. However, if the amount of the addition or the improvement is relatively small, the accounting concept of materiality allows you to expense the entire amount immediately.",what
Is it possible to have a balance sheet for a single day?,"A balance sheet presents the amounts of a company's assets, liabilities, and owner's equity as of an instant or moment in time within a day. Usually it is the instant as of the end of the day. In other words, you can have a balance sheet each day, but the balance sheet amounts represent the amount at the instant or moment after all of the transactions of the specified day have been recorded.
We avoid saying that the balance sheet is for the day, since the amounts are not for the 24-hour period. For example, the cash amount that is reported on the balance sheet is the cash as of the end of the day. For the day, the cash balance may have been $1000 at 8 a.m., $1200 at 9 a.m., $823 at 10 a.m., $3134 at 4 p.m., etc. Similarly, account balances such as accounts receivable and accounts payable are changing during the day.
If you do prepare a balance sheet as of the end of each day, you will need to make daily adjusting entries in order for the balance sheet to be meaningful. For example, each day more electricity is used and therefore each day there is an additional liability and an expense for electricity.",what
Is a utility bill an expense?,"The utility bill for a retailer or for a service company is an expense. Under the accrual basis of accounting, the utility bill is an expense for the period indicated by the meter reading dates.
A manufacturer's utility bill is more complicated. The utility bill for its selling and general administration will be an expense for the period indicated by the meter reading dates. However, the utility bill for the direct and indirect manufacturing operations is part of its manufacturing overhead. As such, the utility bill will be assigned or allocated to the units produced. In other words, the utility bill will be clinging to the units produced. Some of the utility cost will be clinging to the units in inventory and therefore will be part of the cost of the asset inventory. Some of the utility cost will be clinging to the units that have been sold and will be part of the expense known as the cost of goods sold.",what
What are the disclosures for a manufacturer's inventory?,"A manufacturer should disclose the following categories of inventory: raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods, manufacturing supplies, and packaging supplies. When some of these amounts are not significant, some categories may be combined, such as raw materials and supplies, or raw materials and work-in-process.
In addition, a manufacturer (and others with inventory) should disclose the method for valuing the inventory. This includes whether it is cost or the lower of cost or net realizable value, and also the cost flow assumption such as 1) first-in, first-out or FIFO, 2) last-in, first-out or LIFO, 3) weighted average, etc. If LIFO is used, the company must disclose what the dollar amount of inventory would have been if FIFO had been used.",what
What are external financial statements?,"The external financial statements of a U.S. corporation should consist of a complete set of the following:

income statement (statement of earnings, statement of operations)
statement of comprehensive income
balance sheet (statement of financial position)
statement of cash flows (cash flow statement)
statement of stockholders' equity (statement of shareholders' equity, statement of equity)
notes to the financial statements

These financial statements become ""external"" when they are distributed to people and organizations not involved in the corporation's operations. Some examples of external users are current investors and lenders, potential investors and lenders, financial analysts, certain government agencies, credit rating organizations, certain customers and suppliers, and others.
Since the external financial statements are likely to be compared to those of other corporations (and to previously issued financial statements), it is imperative that standardized rules be followed. In the U.S. these common rules are known as generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which are established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).",what
Are income taxes affected by accelerated depreciation?,"Using accelerated depreciation on the income tax return will mean greater depreciation expense and smaller taxable income in the earlier years of an asset's life. However, it will be followed by smaller depreciation expense and greater taxable income in the later years of the asset's life.
For a corporation with consistent taxable income, the use of accelerated depreciation on the income tax return instead of the straight-line method, will defer some income tax until the later years of an asset's life. Over the entire life of the asset, the total depreciation expense is the same. The methods merely affect the timing of the depreciation.
It is also important to note that a corporation may use the straight-line method on its financial statements and at the same time use accelerated depreciation on its income tax returns. The differences in income taxes resulting from using different methods are referred to as timing differences or temporary differences.
You can learn more about the reporting of income taxes caused by timing and temporary differences by reading the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, available at www.FASB.org/st.",what
"If we dispose of an asset, will there be a change in the owner's equity?","The owner's equity of a sole proprietorship will change only if the disposal of an asset causes a gain or loss to be reported on the income statement.
To illustrate this, let's assume that a truck that was used in the business is sold for $5,000. If the truck had a cost of $40,000 and accumulated depreciation of $35,000 there will be no gain or loss reported on the income statement. The reason is the $5,000 received is equal to the $5,000 of book value that is being removed from the balance sheet. With no gain or loss on the disposal, the owner's equity is unchanged.
On the other hand, if the same truck is sold for $3,000 there will be a $2,000 loss ($3,000 of cash received versus the $5,000 of book value removed) reported on the income statement. When the account Loss on Disposal of Assets is closed, the owner's capital account will be reduced by the $2,000 loss.",what
What is a line of credit?,"In business a line of credit or credit line is an arrangement/commitment by a bank or other creditor with a customer. The agreement specifies an amount that the customer can borrow or use in the future, assuming that the customer's financial condition is maintained.
For example, a company may arrange with its bank to borrow money as needed but never owe the bank in excess of $500,000. The agreement might specify that interest will be calculated by multiplying the prime rate times the loan balance.
In the U.S. many individuals have a home equity line of credit that allows them to borrow up to the amount of ""the line.""",what
Where is a manufacturer's inventory reported in the balance sheet?,"A manufacturer's inventory will be reported in the current assets section of the balance sheet and in the notes to the financial statements. In the current assets section the amount of the manufacturer's inventory will be positioned after cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and receivables.
If only the sum of the manufacturer's inventory categories is listed in the current assets section, then the notes to the financial statements will report the detailed amounts for raw materials and supplies, work-in-process and finished goods.
The notes to the financial statements will also described how the manufacturer's inventory is valued. For example, the notes will disclose whether FIFO lower of cost or market, LIFO, weighted average, or other cost flow methods were used. If LIFO is used, then the excess of current cost over LIFO cost is also disclosed.",what
Why is there a large difference between share value and stockholders' equity?,"There can be many reasons why the market value of a corporation's stock is much greater than the amount of stockholders' equity reported on the balance sheet. Let's start by defining stockholders' equity as the difference between the asset amounts reported on the balance sheet minus the liability amounts. Next, the accountant's cost principle requires that only the cost of items purchased can be reported as an asset. This means that valuable trade names that were never purchased (but were developed over time) are not reported on the balance sheet. The same holds for a great management team and an amazing reputation. The cost principle also means that many long-term assets are reported at cost (and not at their current higher market value). Many plant assets are reported at minimal amounts because their costs have been reduced by the cumulative amount of depreciation taken over the years.
Other factors contributing to a high market value might be a corporation's earnings and dividends that are consistently growing and/or a special niche for its products or services that is recognized by the market.
Lastly, a corporation's stockholders' equity may have been reduced from the purchase of treasury stock at a high cost.",what
Are undeposited checks reported as cash?,"Undeposited checks that are not postdated (not dated with a future date) are reported as cash. Accountants define cash as more than just currency and coins. For example, unrestricted checking accounts are also reported as cash.",what
Is the sales tax paid on merchandise that you will resell an expense?,"I believe that most states have sales tax exemptions for merchandise purchased for resale. Check with your state's sales tax department to see if you can obtain a resellers permit to avoid being charged the sales tax by your suppliers.
If you purchase an asset and the sales tax is required, the sales tax should be recorded as part of the cost of the goods or services received. For example, if you were required to pay sales tax on the new company car, the cost of the car will include the sales tax. If you purchased supplies and the cost of the supplies was subject to sales tax, the sales tax is part of the cost of the supplies. If you received services that were subject to the sales tax, the sales tax is a necessary part of the cost of the services.",what
"Why can a retailer record its purchase of merchandise as a debit to purchases within the cost of goods sold, instead of the asset inventory?","Before we explain why companies will record the purchases of merchandise in the Purchases account instead of the Inventory account, let's agree that the objective of the accounting process is to have accurate financial statements. In this case we want an income statement which reports an accurate amount of cost of goods sold, and the resulting gross profit and net income. We need the balance sheet to report an accurate cost of inventory, and the resulting amount of current assets, working capital, total assets, and stockholders' equity. I believe this objective will require some type of an adjustment to the the Inventory account balance and to the cost of goods sold regardless of how the purchases of merchandise were initially recorded.
Now for the reason companies often record purchases in a purchases account. Generally, companies will have a relatively stable amount of inventory and the cost of its annual purchases will be many times the cost of its inventory. This means that most of the cost of its purchases will appear as the cost of goods sold on its income statement. For the minor change in the cost of inventory from the beginning to the end of the accounting period, an adjustment can be made. For example, let's assume that the cost of purchases during the year amounted to $560,000. Let's also assume that the inventory at the end of the year has a cost of $70,000 compared to the inventory cost of $67,000 at the end of the previous accounting year. An adjustment will be entered to debit the Inventory account for $3,000 which will increase the Inventory account balance from $67,000 to $70,000. The credit portion of the entry of $3,000 will cause the cost of goods sold to be reported as $557,000 ($560,000 of debits in the Purchases account during the year minus the amount that increased the cost of inventory: $3,000). After this adjustment, the balance sheet will report the true cost of the ending inventory of $70,000 and the income statement will report the true cost of goods sold of $557,000.",what
What is a permanent account?,"Definition of Permanent Account
In accounting, a permanent account refers to a general ledger account that is not closed at the end of an accounting year. The balance in a permanent account is carried forward to the subsequent year, where it becomes the beginning balance for the new year.
Permanent accounts are also known as real accounts.
Examples of Permanent Accounts
Generally, the balance sheet accounts are permanent accounts, except for the owner's drawing account which is a balance sheet account and a temporary account. (The owner's drawing account is a temporary account because its balance is closed to the owner's capital account at the end of each year in order to begin the next year with a $0 balance.) 
Examples of permanent accounts are:

Asset accounts including Cash, Accounts Receivable, Inventory, Investments, Equipment, and others
Liability accounts such as Accounts Payable, Notes Payable, Accrued Liabilities, Deferred Income Taxes, etc.
Owner's (Stockholders') equity accounts including Owner's Capital, Common Stock, Retained Earnings, and others",what
What causes a corporation's market value to be greater than its book value?,"One cause of a corporation's market value being greater than its book value is the accountant's cost principle. In order for an item to be listed as an asset on a corporation's balance sheet, the item must have been purchased (or donated). If an item is not listed on the balance sheet as an asset, it will not be included in a corporation's book value. (A corporation's book value is the amount of stockholders' equity reported on the balance sheet, which is the amount of assets reported minus the amount of liabilities reported.)
Often a corporation's most valuable assets were not purchased and, therefore, will not be reported as assets and will not be included in the corporation's book value. Think of the late Steve Jobs and the culture he developed at Apple. He and his team, the innovative culture, the wildly successful brand names, etc. could never be listed on the balance sheet as assets nor directly included in the corporation's book value.
On the other hand, the market does recognize those attributes as being immensely valuable. Hence the corporation's market value was and is greater than its book value.",what
Will the adjusting entry amounts appear in the balance sheet and income statement?,"Absolutely. The adjusting entry amounts must be included on the income statement in order to report all revenues earned and all expenses incurred during the accounting period indicated on the income statement. The adjusting entry amounts must also be included in the amounts reported on the balance sheet as of the end of the accounting period.
In the following accounting period, the accrual-type adjusting entries will usually be reversed. They are reversed or removed because the actual invoices or other documents containing the accrued revenues or expenses will be arriving and will be entered into the accounting records by the bookkeeper or the accounts payable clerk.",what
What is the definition of capital market?,"Often, capital market refers to the structured market for trading stocks and bonds. Examples are the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, and the New York Bond Exchange.
However, capital market can also include less structured markets such as private placements for stocks, bonds, and other debt.",what
Why is a product that sells for $50 reported in inventory at its cost of $40?,"Generally, items in inventory are valued at their cost—not their selling prices—because of the cost principle.
Another reason for not valuing items in inventory at their selling prices is that inventory items cannot be sold without a sales effort. Until that effort is made and an item is actually sold, the company cannot report the $10 increase from $40 to $50. This is referred to as the revenue recognition principle. In other words, only after an item is actually sold can the company report the revenue of $50 minus the cost of $40 for a gross profit of $10.
There are some exceptions to reporting inventory at cost. One exception is industries where no sales effort is required and the extensive effort of production has been completed. In these industries the inventory may be reported at its net realizable value, which is the sales value minus the costs to dispose of the items. The gold mining industry and certain other commodities are examples.
Another exception to reporting inventory at cost occurs in any industry when a product will have to be sold for less than its cost. In that situation the item should normally be reported at its net realizable value. (U.S. income tax rules require conformity between tax and financial reporting. As a result, there are complexities involved.)",what
What is a debenture?,"A debenture is an unsecured bond. In other words, a debenture is a bond without a lien on specific assets owned by the issuing corporation.",what
What conditions cause a discount on bonds payable?,"Discount on bonds payable occurs when a bond's stated interest rate is less than the bond market's interest rate.
If a $1,000,000 bond issue promises to pay interest of 8% per year and the bond market demands 8.125%, the bonds will sell for less than $1,000,000. The difference between the $1,000,000 of face value and the amount the bond market is willing to pay is the discount on bonds payable.
The amount of the discount is a function of 1) the number of years before the bonds mature, and 2) the difference in the bond's stated interest rate and the market's interest rate.",what
Is a money market account a current asset or a fixed asset?,A money market account is a current asset unless it is restricted for a long-term purpose. The amount of an unrestricted money market account will likely be reported on the balance sheet as part of a company's cash or its cash and cash equivalents.,what
Where should a business report cash which is restricted to purchase a long-term asset?,"The cash which a business has restricted to purchase a long-term asset should be reported on the balance sheet under the asset heading Investments. Investments is the first of the long-term asset headings and it is positioned immediately after current assets.
The cash restricted for a long-term asset is not reported as part of the company's current assets because the cash is not available to pay current liabilities. Expressed another way, when the business restricts its cash for the purchase of a long-term asset, the business must reduce the amount it reports as working capital (which is current assets minus current liabilities).",what

What does it mean to recognize an expense?,"Definition of Recognize an Expense
To recognize an expense means to report the proper amount of an expense on the income statement for the appropriate accounting period.
When and How to Recognize an Expense

When there is a cause-and-effect relationship between a company's revenues and some of its expenses, these expenses should appear on the same income statement as the associated revenues. Accountants describe this as matching expenses with revenues. For instance, a company's sales of products which are properly reported on its July income statement will cause the related expense known as the cost of goods sold to be reported/recognized on the July income statement. If the company's sales reps have earned commissions on the July sales, these commissions should also be recognized/reported as Commissions Expense on the company's July income statement (regardless of when the company pays the commissions).
If a cause-and-effect relationship does not exist between a company's revenues and its costs, and there is no future economic benefit which can be measured, the costs should be recognized/reported immediately as expenses on the current income statement. A few examples include advertising, office salaries, interest on most loans, and research and development costs.
When a cost has a future economic benefit which can be measured, the accountant should report the cost as an asset. Then as the future benefit expires (is used up) the cost should be systematically recognized/reported as an expense on the appropriate income statements. Some examples include the expensing of prepaid insurance premiums and the depreciation of assets used in the company's business.

Use of Adjusting Entries
Companies use adjusting entries in order for their income statements and balance sheets to be reporting the proper amounts in the appropriate accounting periods under the accrual method of accounting.",what
Why does a cost system developed for inventory valuation distort product cost information?,"The cost system for inventory valuation may have been developed to provide a reasonable total cost of inventory and a reasonable total cost of goods sold in order to have reasonably accurate financial statements. If a company has small inventory amounts and significant sales, a simple cost system that spreads manufacturing overhead costs solely on the basis of machine hours can result in a reasonably accurate balance sheet and income statement.
While a simple cost system using just one cost driver (machine hours) may result in accurate financial statements, it often fails to provide the true cost of individual products that vary in complexity. For example, one product might require very few machine hours but will require many hours of special handling. The costs assigned on the basis of machine hours alone will be too low in relationship to the true cost of manufacturing this product. Another product might require many machine hours but no other activities. This product's cost will be overstated because the rate assigned via the machine hours will include an amount for other activities that generally occur for the other products manufactured.
A cost system developed for inventory valuation is limited to the cost of direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead. The total cost of providing products to a customer will also include nonmanufacturing expenses. One customer might require a company to incur additional selling, delivering, storing, and administrative expenses. Another customer might not require any of those activities and their related expenses.
Activity based costing attempts to calculate the true cost of a product and customer by assigning costs and expenses based on their root causes. Because there are many root causes, the company will assign costs based on many cost drivers. This results in more accuracy for the cost and expense of a specific product for a specific customer than simply spreading the manufacturing costs on the basis of one cost driver such as machine hours.",what
"If an accrual adjusting entry increases an expense and a liability, how does the balance sheet remain in balance?",An expense is a temporary account which reduces owner's equity or stockholders' equity. The decrease in owner's equity will offset the increase in the liability account.,what
What is a toxic asset?,"I would define a toxic asset as an investment whose value has dropped significantly and there is no market in which to sell the asset.
To illustrate, let's assume that at the peak of the real estate market you lent $150,000 to someone who was purchasing a house for $170,000. In other words, you made a $150,000 investment and recorded it as the asset Mortgage Loan Receivable. The house is the collateral for the loan receivable. Within one year, the local housing market drops by 30% and the borrower loses her job. She stops making the loan payments and at that point your Mortgage Loan Receivable account shows a balance of $147,000. This scenario is widespread in your community and houses are not selling.
I would consider your Mortgage Loan Receivable to be a toxic asset. There are few investors willing to purchase a loan without payments being made by the borrower, the value of the collateral has dropped to less than $120,000 ($170,000 minus the 30% average drop in value), and a lot of houses are for sale with virtually no buyers.",what
What is a sale on credit?,"Definition of Sale on Credit
A sale on credit is revenue earned by a company when it sells goods and allows the buyer to pay at a later date. This is also referred to as a sale on account.
Normally, this means that the company selling the goods is transferring ownership of its goods to the buyer and in return has a current asset known as accounts receivable. One consequence is the seller becomes one of the buyer's unsecured creditors. This means that the seller has the risk of bad debts expense if the buyer does not pay the full amount owed to the seller.
Example of a Sale on Credit
Assume that a company is in an industry where it is necessary to give customers invoice payment terms of net 30 days. If the company sells $10,000 of goods to a customer with those terms, the company will debit Accounts Receivable for $10,0000 and will credit Sales for $10,000. When the company receives the $10,000 from the customer, the company will debit Cash for $10,000 and will credit Accounts Receivable for $10,000.",what
What is Subchapter S?,"Subchapter S refers to a section of Chapter 1 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code.
A subchapter S corporation, which is also referred to as an S corporation, is a corporation that does not pay the income taxes on its income. Rather, the owners of the S corporation are responsible for the income taxes which pertain to their share of the S corporation's income. Hence, the income statement of an S corporation does not report income tax expense, and the balance sheet does not report income taxes payable.
There are certain requirements in order to elect the Subchapter S status. Learn more about Subchapter S corporations at www.IRS.gov or from a tax professional.",what
"If cash and a note are exchanged for a plant asset, is the amount of the note used in the depreciation calculation?","A plant asset's cost is depreciated, unless the asset is land.
Cost is defined as the cash or cash equivalent amount at the time of the transaction. This means that the asset's cost is the cash amount plus the note's present value at time that the asset is purchased.
To illustrate this, let's assume that equipment is purchased by giving $50,000 of cash plus a promissory note of $100,000. If the note has an interest rate that is a fair rate considering the market rates and the riskiness of the party signing the note, then the present value of the note is $100,000. The equipment will then be recorded at its cost of $150,000. This cost of $150,000 will be depreciated over the equipment's useful life.
If the note specifies zero interest, then the present value of the note is less than $100,000. Let's assume that the note's present value is computed to be $90,000. This means that the asset's cost will be $140,000—the cash of $50,000 plus the note's $90,000 of present value. Assuming no salvage value, the total depreciation expense over the life of the equipment will equal $140,000. The $10,000 difference will be reported as interest expense over the life of the note.",what
What are quick assets?,"Definition of Quick Assets
Quick assets are a company's current assets which can quickly be converted into cash. Quick assets provide the liquidity necessary to pay the company's obligations when they come due.
The total of a company's quick assets is compared to the total of its current liabilities in the calculation of the company's quick ratio.
Examples of Quick Assets
Common examples of quick assets include:

Cash and cash equivalents
Temporary marketable securities
Accounts receivable (after deducting an allowance for doubtful accounts)

Generally, inventory cannot be converted to cash quickly. Therefore, inventory is not considered to be a quick asset.",what
What is net sales?,"Definition of Net Sales
Under the accrual basis of accounting, net sales is the total amount of goods shipped/delivered to customers during a specified period of time minus any early payment discounts (if offered by the seller) and minus allowances for goods returned by customers, adjustments to the sales invoice amounts, etc. 
Does Sales Include Sales Tax?
The amount of a company's sales does not include the sales taxes collected by the seller. The reason is that the sales taxes included in the sales invoices are not revenues earned by the seller. Instead, the sales taxes are the state/local government's revenues. The seller is merely acting as an agent that is required to collect and remit the sales taxes to the government.
As a result, the sales taxes included in a company's sales invoices are recorded in a current liability account such as Sales Taxes Payable. When the company remits the sales taxes to the state or local government, the balance in Sales Taxes Payable is reduced. Any unremitted balance in Sales Taxes Payble is reported in the current liability section of the company's balance sheet.
Sales vs Net Sales
Assume that a company has sales invoices for the month amounting to $63,000. The sales invoices represent the goods shipped to customers and includes $1,000 of sales taxes pertaining to its retail customers. The company offers credit terms of 1/10, net 30 days and some customers paid within 10 days and were granted early payment discounts of $300. The company also granted allowances of $200 to customers who received damaged goods or had been given a price adjustment.
Given the above information, the company's sales are calculated as follows:
Sales invoices with a total of $63,000 minus $1,000 of sales taxes that were included as required by the state/local government = the company's sales of $62,000. Sales are also referred to as gross sales.
The company's net sales are calculated as follows:
Sales (or gross sales) of $62,000 minus early payment discounts of $300 and sales allowances of $200 = the company's net sales of $61,500.",what
Is the deposit for a booth at a future trade show an asset?,"The deposit for a booth at a future trade show is an asset until the trade show occurs.
Once the trade show occurs the deposit amount should be moved from the balance sheet asset account to an income statement expense account.",what
Why are bonds payable less costly than common stock?,"Bonds payable are less costly than common stock because the bonds issued by a corporation contain a formal contract to pay the investor a fixed amount of interest every six months and to pay the face or principal amount when the bonds mature. The contract to pay these cash amounts to the investors makes bonds a less risky investment than common stock. Less risk for the investor means the investor will earn a smaller return—and the corporation will have a smaller cost.  Some bonds might also provide collateral and some bonds might require that a sinking fund be established to set aside money to pay the bondholders when the bonds come due. These features will further reduce the investor's risk and should further reduce the corporation's cost.
Another reason why bonds are less costly than common stock is that the  interest paid by the corporation will be deductible on the corporation's income tax return. If a corporation's combined federal and state income tax rate is 35%, then $100,000 of interest expense will save the corporation $35,000 of income taxes. This means that a corporation's ultimate or net cost of a 10% bond is only 6.5%.",what
Are LIFO inventory amounts ever written-up to their market value?,"LIFO inventory amounts will not be written-up, even when the current market value of the inventory is far greater than the amount reported on the balance sheet.
The reason inventory is not increased to its current value is the cost principle, the cost flow assumption, consistency, and other accounting concepts and principles. When a company elects the LIFO cost flow assumption, it chooses to put its most recent costs in the cost of goods sold, and to leave its earlier costs in inventory. The company cannot violate the cost principle by later increasing the inventory to an amount that is greater than those earlier actual costs.
One place that you might find part of the difference between the LIFO cost reported on the balance sheet and its current market value is the ""Inventories"" footnote to the financial statements. For example, in General Electric's 2011 Annual Report to the SEC (Form 10-K), it indicates that if General Electric had not been using LIFO (for many years), its balance sheet inventory amount would have been greater by $450 million. That does not mean that the difference between its inventory cost and its market value is $450 million, but I suspect that it is part of the difference.",what
What is a bank reconciliation?,"What is a Bank Reconciliation
A bank reconciliation is a process performed by a company to ensure that its records (check register, general ledger account, balance sheet, etc.) are correct. This is done by comparing the company's recorded amounts with the amounts shown on the bank statement. Any differences must be justified. When there are no unexplained differences, accountants state that the bank statement has been reconciled.
The bank reconciliation is an important part of a company's internal controls over its assets. To be effective, it should be done by someone other than an authorized check signer and/or record keeper.
Example of a Bank Reconciliation
Let's assume that a new company opens its first checking account on June 4 with a deposit of $10,000. During the month of June the company wrote five checks with a total of $5,000. It also made a $2,000 deposit in the bank's night depository after banking hours on June 30. As a result, the company's Cash account (in its general ledger and referred to as the ""books"") as of June 30 shows a positive, debit balance of $7,000.
The bank statement shows a June 30 balance of $5,975. Note that this balance is different from the company's general ledger's Cash account balance of $7,000. Generally, neither balance is the correct amount of cash that should be reported on the company's balance sheet.
To reconcile the company's balance and the bank's balance requires comparing the details. To illustrate, let's assume that:

The bank statement shows a bank service charge of $25, but the company's general ledger does not
The $2,000 deposit made by the company on June 30 is not shown on the bank statement
One of the company's five checks written in June having an amount of $1,000 does not appear on the bank statement

We prefer to perform the bank reconciliation by adjusting both the company's cash balance and the bank statement balance to be the correct amount of the company's checking account balance, as shown here:

The company's Cash account balance of $7,000 needs to be decreased by $25 for the bank service charge. As a result, the adjusted balance per the company's books is $6,975. This is the amount that the company can report on its balance sheet if it agrees to the adjusted balance per the bank.
The bank statement balance of $5,975 needs to be increased for the $2,000 deposit and to be decreased by the $1,000 check. After these adjustments, the adjusted balance per the bank is $6,975 ($5,975 + $2,000 - $1,000).

Since both the company's books and the bank statement have an adjusted balance of $6,975 the bank statement has been reconciled.

What is meant by reconciling an account?,"Definition of Reconciling an Account
Reconciling an account is likely to mean proving or documenting that an account balance is correct.
Examples of Reconciling an Account
When a company reconciles its bank statement, it is reconciling the balance in its general ledger account Cash (or Cash: Checking Account) with the bank's information.
Prior to issuing a company's financial statements, it is wise to reconcile every balance sheet account by collecting the information that supports the accounts' ending balances. For example, the Accounts Receivable balance could begin by comparing the balance with an aging of the accounts receivable. 
Another example is reconciling the balance in the general ledger account Utilities Payable. This might be accomplished by computing the daily cost of each utility that the company uses. The cost per day is then multiplied by the number of days since the last meter reading date shown on the utility bills that have already been recorded.",what
What does debit memo mean on a bank statement?,"Definition of Bank Debit Memo
A debit memo on a company's bank statement refers to a deduction by the bank from the company's bank account. In other words, a bank debit memo reduces the bank account balance similar to a check drawn on the bank account.
Examples of a Bank Debit Memo
Some examples of a bank debit memo include the following withdrawals from a company's checking account:

The company's monthly loan payment
The fee for printing the company's checks
The fee for handling a check that the company deposited and the check was returned because of insufficient funds
A transfer of funds to another account at the bank

The bank's use of the term debit memo is logical because the company's bank account is a liability in the bank's general ledger. (The bank accepted the company's cash which is recorded by a debit to the bank's Cash account, and the bank credits its liability account Customer Deposit Accounts. The liability is appropriate since the bank has the obligation to return the customer's money on demand). The bank's liability is reduced when the bank charges the company's account for a bank fee. Hence, the credit balance in the bank's liability account is reduced by a debit.
In the company's general ledger, the bank debit memo will reduce the company's checking account (which is an asset) and will require the company to credit its Cash account (and debit another account such as Bank Fees Expense).",what
What is a credit memo?,"Definition of Credit Memo
One type of credit memo is issued by a seller in order to reduce the amount that a customer owes from a previously issued sales invoice. Another type of credit memo, or credit memorandum, is issued by a bank when it increases a depositor's checking account for a certain transaction.
Example of a Credit Memo
Assume that SellerCorp had issued a sales invoice for $800 for 100 units of product that it shipped to BuyerCo at a price of $8 each. BuyerCo informs SellerCorp that one of the units is defective. SellerCorp will then issue a credit memo for $8.
The credit memo will result in the following entry in SellerCorp's accounting records: 1) a debit of $8 to Sales Returns and Allowances, and 2) a credit of $8 to Accounts Receivable. In other words, the credit memo reduced SellerCorp's net sales and its accounts receivable. 
When BuyerCo records the credit memo, the following will occur in its accounting records: 1) a debit of $8 to Accounts Payable, and 2) a credit of $8 to Purchases Returns and Allowances (or to Inventory).",what
What is an outstanding check?,"Definition of Outstanding Check
An outstanding check is a check that a company has issued and recorded in its general ledger accounts, but the check has not yet cleared the bank account on which it is drawn. This means that the bank balance will be greater than the company's true amount of cash.
Example of an Outstanding Check in the Bank Reconciliation
In the bank reconciliation process, the total amount of outstanding checks is subtracted from the ending balance on the bank statement when computing the adjusted balance per bank. (No adjustment is needed to the company's general ledger accounts, since the outstanding checks were recorded when they were issued.)
Checks that are outstanding for a long period of time are known as stale checks. In the U.S., outstanding checks are considered to be unclaimed property and the amounts must be turned over to the company's respective state after several years. Therefore, rather than allowing checks to become stale and then remitting the amounts to a state government, companies should contact the payees of any checks that have been outstanding for several months.
The amount of outstanding checks is sometimes referred to as float.",what
Can you help me to understand credit memo and debit memo in the bank reconciliation?,"Definition of Bank Credit Memo
A bank credit memo is an item on a company's bank account statement that increases a company's checking account balance.
Examples of Bank Credit Memo in a Bank Reconciliation
A few examples of a bank credit memo appearing in a company's bank account include:

The bank adding interest that was earned for having money on deposit
The bank having collected a note for the company
A refund of a previous bank charge

Since the amount of the bank's credit memo has already been added to the bank's balance, the bank reconciliation will not reconcile unless the amount is also included in the company's general ledger Cash account. To record the bank credit memo the company will debit Cash and credit another account. For example, if the bank statement shows a credit memo of $20 for interest earned, the company will debit Cash for $20, and credit Interest Income for $20. (The company's Cash account needs to be debited because its asset has increased.)
Definition of Bank Debit Memo
A bank debit memo is an item on a company's bank account statement that reduces the company's checking account balance.
Examples of Bank Debit Memo in a Bank Reconciliation
Some examples of bank debit memos include:

Bank service charge for maintaining the checking account
A subtraction for a customer's check that did not clear the customer's bank account
A bank fee for handling a check that was returned for insufficient funds
A monthly loan payment

Since the amount of a bank debit memo has already been subtracted from the bank account, the amount must also be subtracted from the company's general ledger Cash account. For example, if the bank statement shows a debit memo of $25 for a service charge, it means that the company's general ledger Cash account will need an entry that credits Cash for $25, and debits Bank Fee Expense or Miscellaneous Expense for $25. (The company's Cash account needs to be credited because the company's asset account has decreased.)
[The bank debits the company's bank account balance to reduce the balance because its customers' account balances are liabilities for the bank. For instance, when the bank records a customer's deposit, the bank debits its Cash account and credits its liability account Customer Deposits. Hence, when the bank pays a customer's check, the bank's cash is reduced and the bank's liability account Customer Deposits is reduced. The bank records this with a credit to Cash and a debit to Customer Deposits.]",what
What journal entries are prepared in a bank reconciliation?,"Definition of Journal Entries in a Bank Reconciliation
Journal entries are required in a bank reconciliation when there are adjustments to the balance per books. These adjustments result from items appearing on the bank statement that have not been recorded in the company's general ledger accounts.
Examples of Journal Entries in a Bank Reconciliation
Common adjustments to the balance per books include:

Bank fees or service charges for maintaining the account, fees for returned checks, processing wire transfers, check printing, etc.
Bank interest earned
Loan payments
Electronic charges or remittances from suppliers and others
Customer's checks that were deposited but are now being returned because of insufficient funds

The journal entries for the bank fees would debit Bank Service Charges and credit Cash. 
The journal entry for a customer's check that was returned due to insufficient funds will debit Accounts Receivable and will credit Cash.
Interest earned by the company will be recorded with a debit to Cash and a credit to Interest Income.",what
When does a negative cash balance appear on the balance sheet?,"Definition of Negative Cash Balance
A negative cash balance results when the cash account in a company's general ledger has a credit balance. The credit or negative balance in the checking account is usually caused by a company writing checks for more than it has in its checking account.
Example of Reporting Negative Cash on the Balance Sheet
When a company prepares its balance sheet, a negative balance in the cash account should be reported as a current liability which it might describe as checks written in excess of cash balance. The logic is that the company likely issued the checks to reduce its accounts payable. Since the issued checks will not be paid by the company's bank, the company still has the liability.
A negative cash balance in the general ledger does not mean that the company's bank account is overdrawn. Let's assume that a company writes checks for $100,000 and mails them at the end of the day to suppliers in another state. Those checks might not clear the company's bank account until three or four days later. Therefore, it is possible that the company's Cash account shows a negative $40,000 but at the bank the company's checking account balance could have a positive balance of $60,000. If the company deposits at least $40,000 tomorrow morning, the bank balance will be large enough for the bank to pay the $100,000 of checks it had written.",what
What are some reasons that cause the balance on the bank statement to differ from the cash balance on the books?,"Reasons a Bank Balance Will Differ from a Company's Balance
Some of the reasons for a difference between the balance on the bank statement and the balance on the books include:

Outstanding checks
Deposits in transit
Bank service charges and check printing charges
Errors on the company's books
Electronic charges and deposits that appear on the bank statement but are not yet recorded in the company's records

How to Document the Differences
Any items that are already recorded in the company's general ledger accounts, but have not yet appeared on the bank statement (outstanding checks, deposits in transit), will be noted as an adjustment to the balance per bank statement. Outstanding checks are a deduction to the balance per bank; deposits in transit are an addition to the balance per bank.
If an item is on the bank statement but has not yet been entered on the books, the items are noted as an adjustment to the balance per books. Bank service charges, check printing charges, and other electronic deductions that are not yet recorded in the company's accounts will become deductions from the cash balance per the books. Electronic deposits not yet recorded by the company will become additions to the cash balance per books.",what
What is a deposit in transit?,"Definition of Deposit in Transit
A company's deposit in transit is the currency and customers' checks that have been received and are rightfully reported as cash on the date received, and the amount will not appear on the company's bank statement until a later date. A deposit in transit is also known as an outstanding deposit.
When there is a deposit in transit, the amount should be listed on the company's bank reconciliation as an addition to the balance per bank.
Example of Deposit in Transit
To illustrate a deposit in transit, let's assume that a retailer had sales of $4,600 on Saturday, June 29. The retailer deposits the money in the bank's night depository on Saturday evening. The retailer's Cash should be debited for $4,600 on June 29. However, the bank statement will report the $4,600 as a deposit on Monday, July 1, when the bank processes the items from its night depository.
When preparing a bank reconciliation as of June 30, the company needs to adjust the balance on the bank statement by adding $4,600 for the deposit in transit. This is done because the $4,600 is rightfully included in the company's general ledger as of June 29, but the $4,600 is not reported on the bank statement as of June 30.",what
"In a bank reconciliation, what happens to the outstanding checks of the previous month?","Definition of Outstanding Checks
Outstanding checks are checks written by a company, but the checks have not cleared the bank account. 
Example of an Outstanding Check in the Bank Reconciliation
In a bank reconciliation the outstanding checks are a deduction from the bank balance (or balance per the bank statement).
If an outstanding check from the previous month did not clear the bank account in the current month, the check will remain on the list of outstanding checks. As a result, the bank reconciliation for the current month will again show the outstanding check amount as a subtraction from the bank statement balance.
If an outstanding check of the previous month clears the bank, it means the bank paid the check and the check will appear as a deduction on the statement. Hence, the check is removed from the list of outstanding checks.",what
Why does a company prepare a bank reconciliation?,"Reasons for Preparing a Bank Reconciliation
There are several reasons for a company to prepare a bank reconciliation:

To safeguard the company's cash. Performing a bank reconciliation results in improved internal control over the company's cash if the reconciliation is done by someone other than the person handling and/or recording receipts and payments. Having this additional person prepare the bank reconciliation reduces the odds of an improper use of the company's cash.
To improve the confidence that the amount of cash that is reported on the company's balance sheet is accurate. The additions and deductions on the bank statement are compared (or reconciled) with the items that are entered in the company's general ledger Cash account. Some differences, such as outstanding checks and deposits in transit, are noted as simply timing differences.
Since most companies use the double-entry system of accounting, any omission or error in the company's general ledger Cash account also means that at least one other general ledger account will have a corresponding omission or error. For example, if a company had wired money from its bank account for emergency computer maintenance services and had not recorded the credit to its Cash account, it is also omitting the debit to the account Computer Maintenance Expense. The bank reconciliation could prevent this omission from occurring.",what
What is bank balance and book balance?,"Definition of Bank Balance
The term bank balance is commonly used when reconciling the bank statement. It is also known as the balance per bank or balance per bank statement. Typically it is the ending balance on the bank statement for each month.
Example of Bank Balance
When a company receives its checking account statement from its bank showing June's activity, the ending balance on June 30 is the bank balance. (Generally, this bank balance will not agree with the amount in the company's records since some checks written by the company will not have cleared the bank by June 30. Similarly, some money received by the company on June 30 may not have been deposited in time for the amount to appear on the June bank statement.)
Definition of Book Balance
The term book balance, which is also used in the bank reconciliation is the amount shown in the company's general ledger for the bank account. Book balance is also referred to as the balance per books.
Example of Book Balance
The balance on June 30 in the company's general ledger account entitled Checking Account is the book balance that pertains to the bank account being reconciled. (For an individual, the book balance is likely to be the balance appearing in the person's check register.) It is common for the book balance to not agree with the balance on the bank statement as of the same day. This is the case when there are bank fees or electronic transfers on the bank statement that have not yet been recorded in the company's general ledger accounts. For example, the bank statement may reveal that a bank service charge was withdrawn from the account on the last day of the month.",what
Which items on a bank reconciliation will require a journal entry?,"Journal Entries for Bank Reconciliation
The items on the bank reconciliation that require a journal entry are the items noted as adjustments to books. These are the items that appear on the bank statement, but are not yet recorded in the company's general ledger accounts.
Examples of Journal Entries for Bank Reconciliation
Examples of items requiring a journal entry as the result of the bank reconciliation include:

Bank service charges which are often shown on the last day of the bank statement. Since the service charge is on the bank statement, but not yet on the company's books, a journal entry is needed to credit Cash and to debit an expense such as Bank Charges or Miscellaneous Expense.
Check printing charges
Customer checks that were deposited but are now returned as NSF (not sufficient funds)
Bank fees for returned checks
Corrections made by the bank for the company's errors in its deposits
Collections made by the bank of the company's notes receivable
Interest earned on bank accounts
Miscellaneous bank fees
Loan payments
Electronic deposits and withdrawals",what
What is an unpresented cheque or check and does it require an adjustment to the balance sheet?,"Definition of Unpresented Cheque or Check
An unpresented cheque is a check that a company has written, but the check has not yet been paid by the bank on which it is drawn. An unpresented check is also referred to as an outstanding check or a check that has not yet cleared the bank.
In the bank reconciliation, the unpresented or outstanding check is deducted from the balance per the bank in order to arrive at the adjusted or corrected balance per bank.
Effect of Unpresented Check on Balance Sheet
When a company writes a check, the company records it with a credit to the Cash account in the company's general ledger. Whether the check has or hasn't cleared the bank account, the company's Cash account balance is proper. Hence, the company's general ledger Cash account will not require an adjustment for the unpresented or outstanding check when it is reported on the balance sheet.",what
What items are added to the balance per bank on the bank reconciliation?,"Bank Reconciliation Adjustments to Bank Balance
The items that are added to the balance per bank when doing a bank reconciliation include:

Deposits in transit which include the cash and checks that were received by a company as of the date of the bank statement, but were not deposited in time for them to appear on the bank statement
 Bank errors which resulted in too much withdrawn from the bank account or too little added to the bank account.

[Items that are subtracted from the balance per bank on the bank reconciliation include outstanding checks, and bank errors that when corrected will reduce the bank balance.]",what
How do I write off old outstanding checks?,"Years ago when a check appeared on the bank reconciliation's list of outstanding checks for a lengthy period the answer was easy:

Void the check and add the amount to your checkbook balance.
Debit the general ledger Cash account for the amount, and credit the account that was originally debited.
Remove the check from the bank reconciliation's list of outstanding checks.

Today, the answer is different for U.S. companies as states are now likely to have unclaimed property laws. For example, in my state a check issued to a vendor, but has not cleared the bank on which it is drawn, must be reported to the state after five years. In other words, you will now have to report a liability until the amount is remitted to your state.
Since you wrote the check  and intended for it to be paid from the money in your checking, why not contact the payee as soon as the check is outstanding for 30 days? You may learn that the payee did not receive the check, had misplaced it, etc. Why not help your vendor the way you would want to be helped by your customers?
In short, communicate with the payees of your outstanding checks and eliminate the need for reporting and remitting to your state government many years after the original transactions.",what
What is a post-dated check?,"Definition of a Post-dated Check
A post-dated check (or post-dated cheque) is a check written with a future date. In other words, the date that appears on the check is after the date when the check was written. Even with a future date appearing on the check, the check could clear (be paid from) the bank account prior to that date.
Post-dating a check makes sense only if you are certain that the payee will not cash or deposit the check before the date appearing on the check.
Example of a Post-dated Check
To illustrate, let's assume that on May 22 Jim owes a supplier $2,000 for purchases made 40 days ago. Since Jim does not have the money to pay the supplier, he offers to mail the supplier two $1,000 checks: one check dated for June 20 and the other check dated for July 20. 
The supplier agrees to hold the checks and deposit them on the dates shown on the checks. Jim assures the supplier that the checks will be paid by his bank on those dates.
On June 4, when the supplier receives Jim's postdated checks, the supplier should not debit cash nor credit accounts receivable. The reason is that the checks cannot be turned into cash prior to the dates shown on the checks.",what
What is an outstanding deposit?,"An outstanding deposit refers to a company's receipts (cash, checks from customers, etc.) which have been recorded by the company, but the amount will appear on its bank statement at a later date. An outstanding deposit is also known as a deposit in transit.
To illustrate an outstanding deposit, let's assume that on October 31 a company received cash and checks from customers in the amount of $800. Clearly the company should report the $800 as part of its cash as of October 31. However, the company did not deposit the $800 into its bank account until after October 31. Since the $800 is not on its bank statement as of October 31, the $800 is described as an outstanding deposit or deposit in transit as of October 31.
The $800 outstanding deposit is pertinent to the company's bank reconciliation as of October 31. When the company reconciles the bank statement, the outstanding deposit is an addition to the balance shown on the bank statement as of October 31. (There is no adjustment to the balance per books since the $800 had been recorded as of October 31.)
To guide you in preparing the bank reconciliation we developed a bank reconciliation template/form which is part of AccountingCoach PRO. You can also read our free Explanation of the Bank Reconciliation.",what
Is an entry made for outstanding checks when preparing a bank reconciliation?,"No entry is made to a company's general ledger for outstanding checks when preparing a bank reconciliation. The reason is outstanding checks are an adjustment to the bank balance. Outstanding checks are not an adjustment to the company's Cash account in its general ledger.
However, if a company voids one of its outstanding checks, the company will need to make an entry to its general ledger. The entry will debit Cash in order to increase the account balance. The credit portion of the entry will likely be to the account that was originally debited when the check was issued.",what
What is an overdraft?,"An overdraft usually refers to a checking account where the amount of checks presented to the bank for payment exceeds the amount on deposit. When this occurs we say that the checking account customer has overdrawn its account. The overdraft means that the bank's records indicate a negative checking account balance.
A checking account overdraft will likely result in bank fees for either 1) returning the checks to the endorser or payee so that the account balance will not remain negative, or 2) not returning the checks and allowing the checking account balance to remain negative. If checks are returned, they are often noted as being returned for insufficient funds or not sufficient funds (NSF). The bank of the check endorser is also likely to charge its customer a fee for processing the returned checks.
Many companies write checks for more than the amount on deposit in their checking accounts but may not experience a bank overdraft. The reason is the time delay between writing checks and having them clear the checking account on which they are drawn. Taking advantage of this time delay and not having an overdraft is referred to as playing the float.",what
How do you record a return deposit item on a bank statement?,"A deposited check that bounces (the deposited check is returned unpaid by the bank on which it is drawn) is deducted automatically on the depositor's bank statement. The depositor needs to reduce its general ledger account Cash for the amount that was deducted on its bank statement. (In other words, the bank statement is correct and needs no adjustment. It is the depositor's accounting records that do not reflect the returned check.) This means that the depositor needs to 1) credit Cash, and 2) debit the account that was credited when the depositor originally received the check.
Often the depositor's bank will also charge a fee for handling the returned item. Since that fee is automatically deducted on the bank statement, the amount needs to be deducted from the depositor's Cash account. The journal entry will be a credit to Cash and a debit to another account such as a receivable account.
A simple rule is that the adjustment must go where the item is not yet present. Since the return item and the related bank fee are already on the bank statement, the adjustment must go to the general ledger accounts.",what
What is a restrictive endorsement?,"A restrictive endorsement or restricted endorsement places a limitation on the use of a check or other negotiable financial instrument. The most common restrictive endorsement is the phrase For Deposit Only written along with the payee's signature on the back of a check. Other wording for a similar restrictive endorsement might be Pay to the Order of Sample Bank for deposit to account #xxxx followed by the payee's signature. Many companies endorse checks by using a rubber stamp containing this restriction.
Using a restrictive endorsement is one of many actions that a company can take in order to improve the internal control of its assets.",what
What is the allowance method?,"Definition of Allowance Method
The allowance method usually refers to one of the two ways for reporting bad debts expense that results from a company selling goods or services on credit. (The other way is the direct write-off method.)
Under the allowance method, a company records an adjusting entry at the end of each accounting period for the amount of the losses it anticipates as the result of extending credit to its customers. The entry will involve the operating expense account Bad Debts Expense and the contra-asset account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. Later, when a specific account receivable is actually written off as uncollectible, the company debits Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and credits Accounts Receivable.
The allowance method is preferred over the direct write-off method because:

The income statement will report the bad debts expense closer to the time of the sale or service, and
The balance sheet will report a more realistic net amount of accounts receivable that will actually be turning to cash

The allowance method can be applied in one or both of the following ways:

Focusing on the bad debts expense that is needed on the income statement
Focusing on the balance needed in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts (which will be reported on the balance sheet)

Examples of Allowance Method
Let's assume that a corporation begins operations on November 1 in an industry where it is common to give credit terms of net 30 days. In this industry approximately 0.3% of credit sales will not be collected.
Next, let's assume that the corporation focuses on the bad debts expense. If the corporation's actual credit sales for November are $800,000 it will record an adjusting entry dated November 30 to debit Bad Debts Expense for $2,400 ($800,000 X 0.003) and credit Allowance for Doubtful Accounts for $2,400. As a result, its November income statement will be matching $2,400 of bad debts expense with the credit sales of $800,000. If the balance in Accounts Receivable is $800,000 as of November 30, the corporation will report Accounts Receivable (net) of $797,600.
Focusing on the balance in the account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, the corporation will adjust the balance in the account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts so that the combination of that credit balance and the debit balance in Accounts Receivable will be equal to the amount that is expected to turn to cash. The expected amount will likely be determined by aging the accounts receivable.
If the corporation prepares weekly financial statements, it might focus on the bad debts expense for its weekly financial statements, but at the end of each quarter focus on the allowance account.",what
How do you treat voided checks on the bank reconciliation?,"If a voided check was written in a previous month, remove the voided check from the list of outstanding checks and write a journal entry to debit Cash and credit the account(s) that was debited when the check was originally recorded. This entry restores the cash into the checking account and eliminates the debit entered at the time the check was recorded. If the check was written in the current month, you can simply write the journal entry I just described.
Some software will allow a person to go into a previous period's activity (as well as the current period's activity) and remove the voided check or to change the amount to zero. This too will increase the cash balance and will remove the debit from the account originally debited when the check was recorded.",what
What is an uncleared cheque?,"An uncleared cheque is a cheque that has been written and recorded in the payer's records, but the cheque has not yet been paid by the bank on which it is drawn. In the U.S. accounting textbooks, an uncleared cheque is referred to as an outstanding check.
In the bank reconciliation process an uncleared cheque (or outstanding check) is deducted from the balance shown on the bank statement to arrive at the correct or adjusted balance per bank.",what
What is a checking account?,"A checking account is a bank account in which a company deposits money and can subsequently withdraw the money by writing a check, by using a debit card, arranging for electronic transfers, etc. Except for the uncollected funds associated with recently deposited checks, the money in a checking account is available on demand. (Hence, a bank will refer to the amounts in its customers' checking accounts as demand deposits.)
The balances in checking accounts are considered to be money and will be reported as part of a company's current asset cash. (The bank will report its customers' checking account balances as a current liability.)
As part of its internal controls, a company should reconcile its checking account balance with the balance in the bank's records. This process is known as the bank reconciliation.",what
What is float?,"In accounting and bookkeeping, float is the time between the writing of a check and the time that the check clears the bank account on which it is drawn.
For example, Payer Corporation writes a check for $5,000 and mails it to a supplier on Wednesday. However, the check will not clear Payer Corporation's checking account until Monday. Hence, Payer Corporation will have $5,000 of float between Wednesday and Monday.
Mary plays the float when she mails her rent check on Thursday even though she does not have a sufficient balance in her personal checking account. She is counting on her paycheck being electronically deposited on Monday morning prior to her rent check clearing her checking account.
Float is associated with the outstanding checks shown on the bank reconciliation.",what
What is the segregation of duties?,"The segregation of duties is associated with the safeguarding of an organization's assets and the topic known as internal control.
An example of the segregation of duties would be a company's requirement that the bank statement for its checking account must be reconciled by someone other than a person writing checks and someone other than a person recording amounts in the company's general ledger.
Another example of the segregation of duties is that the person handling cash cannot be the same person that records cash amounts in the company's ledgers.
By segregating or separating the duties, it becomes harder for dishonest actions to go undetected.",what
What is an unpresented check?,"An unpresented check is a check written by a company and entered in its records, but the check has not yet cleared the company's checking account. In other words, the check has not yet been paid by the bank on which the check is drawn. An unpresented check is also known as an outstanding check.
An unpresented check is listed on a bank reconciliation as a subtraction from the bank balance.",what
What is not sufficient funds?,"Not sufficient funds or NSF is the term used to describe a check that has been returned by the bank on which it was drawn because the checking account balance was less than the amount of the check.
A check noted as not sufficient funds, NSF, or insufficient funds is also referred to as a returned check, a return item, a check that bounced, or as a rubber check since it was bounced back to the payee by the bank on which the check was drawn.
Checks returned as not sufficient funds usually result in bank charges for both the payee and for the person writing the check.
A check returned as not sufficient funds could be an indication that the financial condition of the maker of the check had declined. This could signal a potential credit loss if the maker of the check is a customer to which you extend credit terms on its purchases.",what
How many days after a month ends should the bank reconciliation be done?,"The bank reconciliation should be done within a few days after the month ends. The reasons include 1) making certain that the company's Cash account has the correct balance, and 2) making sure that the financial statements for the month include all of the company's transactions. At the latest, the bank reconciliation should be done prior to closing the books for the month.
The bank reconciliation might reveal that some revenues and/or receipts were electronically deposited into the bank account but were not yet recorded in the accounting records. Likewise, there might be some expenses and/or payments that were deducted electronically from the bank account, but were not yet entered into the company's accounts. Further, the bank reconciliation might reveal some errors in the transactions already recorded in the company's general ledger.
To save time and to improve internal control, have the bank reconciliation be performed by someone other than the person writing the checks and/or recording amounts in the general ledger.",what
What adjustment is needed when a check that was written in a previous month appears on the current month's bank statement?,"A check written in any previous month but not appearing on previous bank statements, should have been included in last month's list of outstanding checks. Now that the check appears on the current month's bank statement, the check should not be included in the current month's list of outstanding checks. No other action is needed.
The general ledger account has always been correct, because the amount of the check reduced the general ledger account balance at the time the check was written and recorded.
The problem was the previous bank statements. The bank statement balances were too high since the check had not yet cleared the bank checking account. That's why we subtract the amount of the outstanding checks from the bank statement balance. Now that the bank statement balance has been reduced by the check clearing the bank account, there is no longer a need to further subtract the amount of the check as outstanding.",what
What is a voided check?,"A voided check is a check written or partially written but then canceled or deleted by the maker of the check.
The notation of ""void"" is used because checks are prenumbered for control purposes and every check needs to be accounted for.
Voided checks may require some adjustments when reconciling the bank statement. For example, if a check is written in December but is voided in January, the Cash account in the company's general ledger will need to be increased when the check is voided. (Another account will need to be credited because of double entry bookkeeping.)",what
Reconciling the Bank Statement,"Here's a tip a dear neighbor (Herb) had learned in the 1920's from an instructor at a technical college: When doing the bank reconciliation, put it where it ain't. He found it to be helpful and wanted me to share it.
Here are several examples to show how it helped Herb and others:
The bank statement already shows the bank service charge. However, the company usually doesn't know the amount of the service charge until the bank statement arrives. So at that point the service charge is not in the company's general ledger. To reconcile the bank statement with the general ledger Cash account, you will need to enter the bank service charge into the Cash account. Therefore, in the bank reconciliation process the bank service charge will be listed as an adjustment to the books (to the Cash account). As my neighbor learned, you put the service charge where it ain't.
Next let's talk about outstanding checks. Outstanding checks are checks that have been written by the company, but these checks have not yet cleared the bank. (They have not yet made their way to the company's bank account on which they were drawn or written.) Outstanding checks, like all checks written, are already recorded on the company's books, but they are not on the bank statement. Guess what? Put them where they ain't. Outstanding checks will be listed as an adjustment to the balance per the bank.
Deposits in transit are already on the books, but they are not on the bank statement. Deposits in transit will be an adjustment to the balance per bank.
I hope you found Herb's tip to be helpful.",what
What is a rubber check?,"A rubber check is a check that is not paid (or honored) by the bank on which it is drawn. The reason the check is not paid is the maker's account had insufficient funds or not sufficient funds (NSF). Instead of the check being paid, it will be returned (or bounced back) through the banking system. Because the check was bounced back by the bank, the check is described as a rubber check.
A rubber check also causes bank fees for the maker of the check and for the depositor of the check. These fees need to be recorded in the general ledger accounts. If the fees are overlooked initially, they will be adjusting items to the balance per books in the bank reconciliation.
If a rubber check is not redeposited by the payee, the payee must also reduce its general ledger cash account for the amount of the check (and also debit another general ledger account).",what
How do you balance a checkbook?,"You balance a checkbook by comparing the amounts on your bank statement or in your bank account to the amounts you have in your checkbook or check register. Accountants refer to this as reconciling the bank statement or doing a bank reconciliation or bank rec (pronounced as ""wreck"").",what
What is a transposition error?,"Definition of Transposition Error
A transposition error occurs when an amount is recorded incorrectly as the result of switching the positions of two (or more) digits. The switching of the positions causes a difference (between the recorded amount and the correct amount) that will be evenly divisible by 9.
Examples of Transposition Errors
For example, if 986 was the correct amount, but it was recorded incorrectly as 968, the difference between the two amounts is 18. Since this difference is evenly divisible by 9 (18 divided by 9 = exactly 2), the mistake is described as a transposition error. Another example of the many possible transposition errors is recording 3662 as 3626. In this situation, the difference between the correct and incorrect amounts is 36. Because the difference is evenly divisible by 9 (36 divided by 9 = exactly 4), this indicates that the error could be the result of transposing digits.
Determining Whether a Transposition Error Was Involved
If you are faced with finding a difference between two amounts, you might save some time by first dividing the difference by 9. (A few differences that are evenly divisible by 9 include: 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, etc.) Knowing that the error could be a transposition error may lead you to first review the more relevant amounts.",what
Should receipts be recorded using the date the money was received or the date the money was deposited in the bank accounts?,"Cash receipts should be recorded with the date the money was received. For example, a church collects money during each of its services on Sunday, June 4.
On Monday, June 5, the money is counted and is deposited into the church's bank account. The transaction to record the cash and the revenues (remember double entry) should be dated Sunday, June 4, since that is the day of the transaction—the day the church received the money.
The day the money is deposited into the bank account is not the proper date of the transaction. The accounting records should report that the money was received on Sunday, June 4.",what
How does one prepare a company's first bank statement reconciliation?,"To prepare a bank reconciliation for a company that never prepared one previously, I would first make a list of outstanding checks. For example, if your recent bank statement is dated August 31, I would look at the bank statements from June through August and make a list of the check numbers that had been written after June 1, but had not appeared on any of the bank statements from June through August. Next to each check number write the dollar amount of each check. Subtract the total of the outstanding checks as of August 31 from the bank statement balance as of August 31. The resulting amount is the adjusted balance per bank. 
Next, look at the general ledger account that is associated with the bank statement. Let's assume it is the Cash account. Be certain that the Cash account shows items that appear on the recent bank statements. For example, Have the bank service charges been entered in the Cash account? Have the electronic transfers been entered? If not, you will need to make those entries. You may have to go back to earlier bank statements and enter those amounts as well.
Eventually, you need to get the August 31 balance in the Cash account to be equal to the adjusted balance per bank. If the difference is not a significant amount, you can debit or credit the Cash account for the amount necessary for it to agree to the adjusted balance per bank. I would put the same amount into an income statement account such as Difference per Bank Rec. Keep a copy of your documentation and begin a file entitled Bank Reconciliations.
When the September 30 bank statement arrives, prepare another bank reconciliation. Using a copy of the August 31 listing of outstanding checks, cross off the checks that cleared on the September bank statement. Prepare a September 30 listing of outstanding checks beginning with the checks not crossed off on the August 31 copy, and then add the checks written in September that did not clear on the September bank statement. The total of the outstanding checks as of September 30 should be deducted from the bank statement balance of September 30 to arrive at the adjusted balance per bank as of September 30. Be sure to enter into the Cash account the September bank service charge and other items appearing on the bank statement that have not yet been entered in the Cash account. This adjusted balance in the Cash account as of September 30 should be the same as the adjusted balance per bank as of September 30. If there is a difference, you must identify it and make any necessary adjustments.",what
How do you record a check that clears the bank months after it was voided? ,"Since you had voided the check months earlier, your general ledger no longer reflects 1) the original credit to the cash account, and 2) the original debit to another account. Now that the voided check has cleared the bank account, you will need to record the check in your general ledger. The entry will be a credit to the general ledger cash account and a debit (or debits) to the appropriate account.
It might be helpful to recall the bank reconciliation rule: Put it where it isn't. The old check, which you had voided, is now on the bank statement, but it is not in the cash account. Therefore, you need to put the check amount into the general ledger.",what
Are undeposited checks reported as cash?,"Undeposited checks that are not postdated (not dated with a future date) are reported as cash. Accountants define cash as more than just currency and coins. For example, unrestricted checking accounts are also reported as cash.",what
What is the difference between stocks and bonds?,"Definition of Stocks
Stocks, or shares of capital stock, represent an ownership interest in a corporation. Every corporation has common stock. Some corporations issue preferred stock in addition to its common stock. Shares of common stock do not have maturity dates.
Stocks pay dividends, which are a distribution of the corporation's profits to its owners. However, the dividend occurs only if the corporation's board of directors declare the dividend. The dividend payments are not an expense on the corporation's financial statements or on its U.S. income tax return.
Definition of Bonds
Bonds are a form of long-term debt in which the issuing corporation promises to pay the principal amount at a specified maturity date. 
Bonds also promise to pay a fixed interest payment to the bondholders usually every six months until the bonds mature. In the U.S. the interest paid to the bondholders by the corporation is a deductible expense on the corporation's income tax return.
Typically businesses do not issue bonds.",what
What is a current liability?,"Definition of Current Liability
A current liability is:

An obligation that will be due within one year of the date of the company's balance sheet, and
Will require the use of a current asset or will create another current liability

However, if a company's normal operating cycle is longer than one year, current liabilities are the obligations that will be due within the operating cycle.
Current liabilities are usually reported as a separate section of a company's balance sheet. This allows readers to subtract their total from the company's total amount of current assets in order to determine a company's working capital. (Dividing current assets by the current liabilities is the company's current ratio.)
Examples of Current Liabilities
The following are common examples of current liabilities:

Accounts payable or trade payables
Notes payable that will be due within one year
The principal portion of a long-term loan that must be paid within one year
Wages payable
Income taxes payable
Interest payable
Other accrued expenses payable
Deferred revenues and customer deposits",what
What is the difference between equity financing and debt financing?,"Definition of Equity Financing
Equity financing involves increasing the owner's equity of a sole proprietorship or increasing the stockholders' equity of a corporation to acquire an asset.
When a corporation issues additional shares of common stock the number of issued and outstanding shares will increase. This increase will cause the previous stockholders' ownership percentage to be reduced.
Definition of Debt Financing
Debt financing means borrowing money in order to acquire an asset. Financing with debt is referred to as financial leverage. Using debt financing allows the existing stockholders to maintain their percentage of ownership, since no new stock is being issued. However, the additional debt adds risk and may result in higher interest rates for future loans.
Debt financing often comes with strict conditions or covenants regarding interest and principal payments, maintaining certain financial ratios, and more. Failure to meet those conditions can result in severe consequences. In the U.S., a benefit of debt financing is that the interest on the debt is an income tax deductible expense. This income tax savings will partially offset the interest expense on the debt.",what
What is the carrying amount?,"Definition of Carrying Amount
The term carrying amount is also known as book value or carrying value. The term carrying amount is often used when there is a valuation account associated with another general ledger account. 
Examples of Carrying Amount
Here are some examples when the term carrying amount or carrying value is used:

A company's Accounts Receivable has a debit balance of $84,000. The company's Allowance for Doubtful Accounts has a credit balance of $3,000. The carrying amount or carrying value of the receivables is $81,000.
A company has a truck that has its cost of $50,000 in its account entitled Truck. The associated account Accumulated Depreciation has a credit balance of $43,000. The truck's carry amount or book value is $7,000.
A corporation has Bonds Payable of $3,000,000 and Unamortized Discount on Bonds Payable of $150,000 and Unamortized Issue Costs of $50,000. The carrying value of the bonds is $2,800,000.",what
What is par value?,"Definition of Par Value
Par value is a per share amount that will appear on some stock certificates and in the corporation's articles of incorporation. (Some states may require a corporation to have a par value while others states do not require a par value.) (Par value can also refer to an amount that appears on bond certificates.)
In the case of common stock the par value per share is usually a very small amount such as $0.10 or $0.01 and it has no connection to the market value of the share of stock. The par value is sometimes referred to as the common stock's legal capital. When a corporation's common or preferred stock has a par value, corporation's balance sheet will report the total par value of the shares issued for each class of stock. This will be shown as a separate amount in the paid-in capital or contributed capital section of stockholders' equity.
Example of Par Value
Let's assume that a share of common stock has a par value of $0.01 and is sold to an investor for $25. The corporation issuing the stock will debit Cash for $25.00 and will credit Common Stock for $0.01 and will credit Additional Paid-in Capital for $24.99.",what
Where is the premium or discount on bonds payable presented on the balance sheet?,"Definition of Premium or Discount on Bonds Payable
The premium or discount on bonds payable is the difference between the amount received by the corporation issuing the bonds and the par value or face amount of the bonds. If the amount received is greater than the par value, the difference is known as the premium on bonds payable. If the amount received is less than the par value, the difference is known as the discount on bonds payable.
The premium and discount accounts are viewed as valuation accounts. The unamortized premium on bonds payable will have a credit balance that increases the carrying amount (or the book value) of the bonds payable. The unamortized discount on bonds payable will have a debit balance and that decreases the carrying amount (or book value) of the bonds payable.
The premium or discount is to be amortized to interest expense over the life of the bonds. Hence, the balance in the premium or discount account is the unamortized balance.
Where the Premium or Discount on Bonds Payable is Presented
The premium or the discount on bonds payable that has not yet been amortized to interest expense will be reported immediately after the par value of the bonds in the liabilities section of the balance sheet. Generally, if the bonds are not maturing within one year of the balance sheet date, the amounts will be reported in the long-term or noncurrent liabilities section of the balance sheet.",what
What is the effective interest rate?,"Definition of Effective Interest Rate
The effective interest rate is the true rate of interest earned. It can also mean the market interest rate, the yield to maturity, the discount rate, the internal rate of return, the annual percentage rate (APR), and the targeted or required interest rate.
Example of the Effective Interest Rate
Assume that a corporation issues a $1,000 bond with a stated, contractual, face, or nominal interest rate of 5%. This means that the corporation will pay exactly $50 per year during the life of the bond plus the principal amount at maturity. Let's also assume that after the bonds are issued the market interest rates increase by one percentage point. As a result the 5% bond will lose some of its value because the contractual payment of $50 per year is not worth $1,000 when the market is paying $60 per year for a similar $1,000 bond. An investor will purchase the 5% bond only if the cost is low enough to yield 6% over the remaining life of the bond. In other words, the investor will pay less than the $1,000 so that the effective interest rate for the remaining life of the bond will be 6%.",what
Why does a bond's price decrease when interest rates increase?,"Definition of Bond's Price
A bond's price is the present value of the following future cash amounts:

The cash interest payments that occur every six months, plus
The lump sum cash amount that occurs when the bond matures

Typically, a bond's future cash payments will not change, but the market interest rates will change frequently. The change in the market interest rates will cause the bond's present value or price to change. For instance, if a bond promises to pay 6% interest annually and the market rate is 6%, the bond's price should be the same as the bond's maturity value. However, if the market rate increases to 7%, and an existing bond is promising to pay only 6%, the 6% bond will not be worth its face value or maturity value. For it to be sold, the price will have to be less than the maturity amount. However, if the market rates drop to 5%, an existing bond that is promising to pay 6% will be very attractive. As a result, this bond will sell for more than its maturity value. 
In summary, an existing bond's price or present value moves in the opposite direction of the change in market interest rates:

Bond prices will go up when interest rates go down, and
Bond prices will go down when interest rates go up

Example of a Bond's Price
Let's assume there is a $100,000 bond with a stated interest rate of 9% and a remaining life of 5 years. This means that the bond is promising to pay $4,500 at the end of each of the 10 remaining semiannual periods plus $100,000 at the end of the bond's life. If an investor's goal is to earn 9% and the market interest rate is 9%, the investor will pay $100,000 for the bond. However, if the market interest rates increase to 10%, any investor will be able to earn $5,000 semiannually on a $100,000 investment. Obviously, the 9% bond (paying only $4,500 semiannually) will not get sold for $100,000. To get sold, the price will have to be less than $100,000.
For an investor to buy the 9% bond in a 10% market, the bond's price will have to drop to an amount that will provide the buyer with a yield to maturity of 10%. Let's assume that the present value calculation indicates that the price would have to be $96,000. The cash payments of $4,500 every six months for five years on the $96,000 cash investment plus the gain of $4,000 (receiving $100,000 in 5 years versus the investment of $96,000) will result in the required yield of 10%.",what
What is the advantage of issuing bonds instead of stock?,"Definition of Bonds
Bonds payable are a form of long-term debt, which include a formal agreement to pay interest semiannually and the principal amount at maturity. The interest is an expense that reduces the corporation's earnings and its taxable income.
Definition of Stock
Shares of common stock are ownership interests in a corporation. There is no promise to pay dividends nor is there a maturity date. The dividends (if any are paid) do not reduce earnings nor do they reduce the corporation's taxable income. 
Advantages of Issuing Bonds Instead of Stock
There are several advantages of issuing bonds (or other debt) instead of issuing shares of common stock:

Interest on bonds and other debt is deductible on the corporation's income tax return while the dividends on common stock are not deductible on the income tax return. Hence, if a corporation's incremental federal and state income tax rate is 30%, bond interest payments of $40,000 will reduce the income tax payments by $12,000 (30% of the $40,000 reduction in taxable income). If the bond interest rate is 6%, the after-tax interest cost is 4.2% [6% minus 1.8% (30% of 6%)].
Since bonds are a form of debt, the existing stockholders' ownership interest in the corporation will not be diluted. Therefore, the future gains from use of the bond proceeds (minus the bond interest payments) will flow to the stockholders. This is related to the concept of leverage or trading on equity.",what
What is the difference between dividends and interest expense?,"Dividends are a distribution of a corporation's earnings to its stockholders. Dividends are not an expense of the corporation and, therefore, dividends do not reduce the corporation's net income or its taxable income. When a dividend of $100,000 is declared and paid, the corporation's cash is reduced by $100,000 and its retained earnings (part of stockholders' equity) is reduced by $100,000.
Interest on bonds and other debt is an expense of the corporation. The interest expense will reduce the corporation's net income and its taxable income. When interest expense occurs and is paid, the corporation's cash is reduced by the interest payment, but some cash will be saved by the reduction in income taxes. The corporation's retained earnings will also be reduced by less than the amount of interest expense. For example, if a corporation has an incremental tax rate of 40%, interest expense of $100,000 will result in $40,000 less in income tax expense and income tax payments. This means that an interest payment of $100,000 will reduce the corporation's cash and retained earnings by the net amount of $60,000 ($100,000 of interest minus $40,000 of tax savings).
Since interest is formally promised to the lenders, accountants must accrue interest expense and the related liability Interest Payable. If the payment for interest is not made, the corporation will face legal consequences.
Dividends on common stock are not legally required. Therefore, if the corporation does not declare a dividend there is no liability for the omitted dividends.",what
What is the amortization of premium on bonds payable?,"Definition of Amortization of Premium on Bonds Payable
The amortization of the premium on bonds payable is the systematic movement of the amount of premium received when the corporation issued the bonds. The premium was received because the bonds' stated interest rate was greater than the market interest rate.
The amount of the premium is recorded in a separate bond-related liability account. Over the life of the bonds the premium amount will be systematically moved to the income statement as a reduction of Bond Interest Expense.
Example of Amortization of Premium on Bonds Payable
Assume that a corporation issues bonds payable having a maturity value of $1,000,000 and receives a premium of $60,000. The bonds mature in 20 years and there was no accrued interest at the time the bonds are issued.
The corporation will record the bonds as follows:

Debit Cash for $1,060,000 (the amount received from investors)
Credit Bonds Payable for $1,000,000 (the face, par, and maturity amount)
Credit Premium on Bonds Payable for $60,000 (the amount to be amortized)

Since the premium of $60,000 is related to the interest rates when the bonds were issued, the amortization of the premium will involve the account Interest Expense or Bond Interest Expense. Since the bonds mature in 20 years, the $60,000 of premium on bonds payable will mean an annual amortization of $3,000 ($60,000/20 year). The entry for the annual amortization will be the following:

Debit Premium on Bonds Payable for $3,000
Credit Interest Expense for $3,000

Reducing the balance in the account Premium on Bonds Payable by the same amount each period is known as the straight-line method of amortization. A more precise method, the effective interest rate method of amortization, is preferred when the amount of the premium is a large amount.",what
How do you record bonds that are issued?,"Definition of Bonds Payable
Bonds payable is a form of long-term debt often issued by large corporations especially public utilities when constructing large, expensive power plants for generating electricity.
Bonds typically pay interest semiannually at a fixed rate until the bonds mature many years into the future. If the bonds' interest rate is less than the market rates when the bonds are offered, the bonds will sell at a discount. If the bonds' interest rate is greater than the market rate when the bonds are offered, the bonds will sell at a premium. Any discount or premium on the bonds is recorded in a separate account. Another account is used to record the bond issue costs such as legal fees, auditing fees, registration fees, etc. These bond-related accounts will be presented in the long-term liability section of the balance sheet. Any balances in the discount, premium, or issue costs accounts must be amortized to interest expense over the life of the bonds. 
Example of Recording a Bond Issue
Assume that a corporation issues $100 million of bonds payable at an annual interest rate of 5%. The bonds are offered when the market interest rate is 5.1% and there was no accrued interest. As a result, the investors paid $99.5 million for the bonds. The corporation also incurred $1 million of bond issue costs which were paid from bonds' proceeds.
The entry to record the issuance of the bonds is:

Debit Cash for $98.5 million
Debit Bond Discount for $0.5 million
Debit Bond Issue Costs for $1 million
Credit Bonds Payable for $100 million",what
What is a bond sinking fund?,"A bond sinking fund is a restricted asset of a corporation that was required to set aside money for redeeming or buying back some of its bonds payable. The bond sinking fund begins when the corporation deposits money with an independent trustee. The trustee then invests the money in order for the balance in the sinking fund to increase. The balance in the sinking fund will also grow from additional required deposits made by the corporation. The bond sinking fund decreases when the trustee purchases or redeems the corporation's bonds.
Not all corporations with bonds payable are required to have a bond sinking fund. However, bonds with sinking funds are likely to be viewed as less risky.
A bond sinking fund is reported on the bond issuer's balance sheet under the caption Investments, the first long-term (or noncurrent) asset section appearing immediately after current assets.",what
What are bonds payable?,"Definition of Bonds Payable
Bonds payable are a form of long term debt usually issued by corporations, hospitals, and governments. The issuer of bonds makes a formal promise/agreement to pay interest usually every six months (semiannually) and to pay the principal or maturity amount at a specified date some years in the future. The agreement containing the details of the bonds payable is known as the bond indenture.
U. S. corporations issue bonds instead of common stock for the following reasons:

Debt is less costly than common stock
The interest on bonds is deductible for income tax purposes
Bondholders are not owners and therefore the ownership interest of the existing stockholders will not be diluted

Example of Bonds Payable
Usually public utilities issue bonds to help finance a new electric power plant, hospitals issue bonds for new buildings, and governments issue bonds to finance projects, operating deficits, or to redeem older bonds that are maturing.
For example, a profitable public utility might finance half of the cost of a new electricity generating power plant by issuing 30-year bonds. If the current market interest rate for the bonds is 4%, the cost after the income tax savings may be only 3%.",what
Where does a bond sinking fund appear on the balance sheet?,"A bond sinking fund is reported in the section of the balance sheet immediately after the current assets. The bond sinking fund is part of the long-term asset section that usually has the heading ""Investments.""
The bond sinking fund is a long-term (noncurrent) asset even if the fund contains only cash. The reason is the cash in the fund must be used to retire bonds, which are long-term liabilities. In other words, because the money in the bond sinking fund cannot be used to pay current liabilities, it must be reported outside of the working capital section of the balance sheet. (Working capital is current assets minus current liabilities.)",what
What is a contra liability account?,"A contra liability account is a liability account where the balance is expected to be a debit balance. Since a debit balance in a liability account is contrary to the normal credit balance, the account is referred to as a contra liability account.
The most common contra liability accounts are Discount on Bonds Payable, Bond Issue Costs, Debt Issue Costs, and Discount on Notes Payable. The debit balances in these accounts are amortized or allocated to Interest Expense over the life of the bonds or notes.
The credit balance in the liability account Bonds Payable minus the debit balances in the contra liability accounts Discount on Bonds Payable and Bond Issue Costs is the carrying value or book value of the bonds. The credit balance in Notes Payable minus the debit balances in Discount on Notes Payable and Debt Issue Costs is the carrying value or book value of the notes payable.",what
Why would someone buy a bond at a premium?,"A person would buy a bond at a premium (pay more than its maturity value) because the bond's stated interest rate (and therefore its interest payments) are greater than those expected by the current bond market. It is also possible that a bond investor will have no choice. For example, if you wish to purchase a bond maturing in 8 years with a specific bond rating, there might be only one bond available. If its stated interest rate is greater than the market interest rate on the day that you are purchasing, you either buy the bond at a premium or you don't buy a bond.
The bond premium is the present value of both the future interest payments and the maturity amount minus the bond's undiscounted maturity amount. In short, the bond market is very efficient. If a bond's actual interest payments will be greater than the interest payments expected by the market, the bond will sell for more than the bond's maturity amount. If the bond's interest payments will be lower than the interest payments expected by the market, the bond will sell for less than the bond's maturity amount. The difference (premium or discount) is computed by discounting all of the future cash amounts.
Paying a small premium is not unusual. Remember that the premium is directly related to the higher interest amounts you will be receiving. If the bond purchase will result in a large premium, you should investigate whether the bond is callable and its call price. The call price may limit the amount of premium that you are willing to pay.",what
What is premium on bonds payable?,"Premium on bonds payable (or bond premium) occurs when bonds payable are issued for an amount greater than their face or maturity amount. This is caused by the bonds having a stated interest rate that is higher than the market interest rate for similar bonds.
To illustrate the premium on bonds payable, let's assume that a corporation prepares to issue bonds with a maturity amount of $10,000,000 and a stated interest rate of 6%. However, when the 6% bonds are actually sold, the market interest rate is 5.9%. Since the bonds will be paying investors more than the interest required by the market ($600,000 instead of $590,000 per year), the investors will pay more than $10,000,000 for the bonds. If we assume the investors pay $10,150,000 for the bonds, the corporation will record the transaction with a debit to Cash of $10,150,000; a credit to Bonds Payable of $10,000,000 and a credit of $150,000 to Premium on Bonds Payable (an adjunct liability account).
Over the life of the bonds, the $150,000 premium is to be accounted for as a reduction of the corporation's interest expense. This is done through the amortization of premium on bonds payable.
The combination of 1) the unamortized credit balance in the account Premium on Bonds Payable, 2) the unamortized debit balance in the account Bond Issue Costs, and 3) the $10,000,000 credit balance in Bonds Payable is known as the book value or the carrying value of the bonds payable.",what
What is discount on bonds payable?,"Discount on bonds payable (or bond discount) occurs when bonds are issued for less than their face or maturity amount. This is caused by the bonds having a stated interest rate which is lower than the market interest rate for similar bonds.
To illustrate the discount on bonds payable let's assume that a corporation will be issuing bonds with a maturity amount of $5,000,000 and a stated interest rate of 6% per year. However, the bonds are actually issued when the market demanded 6.1%. Since the investors will insist on earning the market interest rate of 6.1% the investors will not pay the full $5,000,000. If we assume that investors pay $4,900,000 for the bonds, the difference of $100,000 will be recorded by the issuer as a debit to the contra liability account Discount on Bonds Payable.
Over the life of the bonds the debit balance in Discount on Bonds Payable will decrease as it is amortized to Interest Expense. The combination of the unamortized debit balance in Discount on Bonds Payable, the unamortized debit balance in Bond Issue Costs, and the $5,000,000 credit balance in Bonds Payable is the book value or carrying value of the bonds payable.",what
Are bonds payable reported as a current liability if they mature in six months?,"Bonds payable that mature (or come due) within one year of the balance sheet date will be reported as a current liability if the issuer of the bonds must use a current asset or will create a current liability in order to pay the bondholders when the bonds mature.
However, the bonds could be reported as a long-term liability right up to the maturity date if:

The company has a sufficient, long-term investment that is restricted for the purpose of paying the bondholders when the bonds mature. This type of investment is known as a bond sinking fund.
The company has a binding agreement that guarantees that the existing bonds will be refinanced by issuing new bonds or by issuing shares of stock.",what
What is a valuation account?,"In accounting, a valuation account is usually a balance sheet account that is used in combination with another balance sheet account in order to report the carrying amount of an asset or liability.
An example of a valuation account that is associated with an asset is the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. This account's credit balance will be combined with the debit balance in Accounts Receivable in order to report the carrying amount of the company's accounts receivable. Other valuation accounts include Discount on Notes Receivable, Accumulated Depreciation, and allowance accounts used with inventory and investments.
Two examples of a valuation account associated with a liability are Bond Issue Costs and Discount on Bonds Payable. The debit balances in these valuation accounts will be combined with the credit balance in Bonds Payable in order to report the carrying amount of the bonds. Premium on Bonds Payable is a valuation account with a credit balance.",what
What is the difference between a note payable and a bond payable?,"For accounting purposes, a note payable and a bond payable are similar. That is, both are 1) written promises to pay interest and to repay the principal amount or maturity amount on specified future dates, 2) both are reported as liabilities, and 3) interest is accrued as a current liability.
If the bond or the note has its principal or maturity due within one year of the balance sheet date and the payment will cause a reduction in working capital, the bond or note will be reported as a current liability. If the bond or note will not be due within one year of the balance sheet date or if the maturity date is within one year but will not cause a reduction in working capital when it becomes due, it will be reported as a long-term liability. (For example, there may be a bond sinking fund or a formal agreement for refinancing the debt with new long-term debt or stock.)
Outside of accounting, I am certain there are differences. For example, debt with an original maturity date of less than a year is likely to be a note. However, some notes can be longer than one year. Government debt securities might be bills, notes, or bonds depending on the original maturity date of the debt security. Perhaps some notes do not specify interest.",what
What is a bond?,"There are several business definitions for bond.

A bond could be a formal debt instrument issued by a corporation or government and purchased by investors. This is the meaning when we say that a public utility issued or sold bonds to help finance a new power plant. Investors talk about investing in stocks and bonds.
A bond is also used to describe a guarantee of another person's obligation. For example, an insurance company might issue a $500,000 surety bond needed by a company in order to engage in transactions on credit. This use of bond means that the insurance company is guaranteeing that it will pay up to $500,000 if the insured company does not make its required payments for its purchases.
We also use bond to mean that a company purchases insurance to protect itself from dishonest acts by its employees handling money. For example, some accounting textbooks state that a company's employees should be bonded. However, the cost of such protection may far exceed the expected benefits.",what
How do you compute the selling price of a bond?,"The selling price or the market value of a bond is the present value of the future cash derived from the bond. In other words, the semiannual interest payments and the payment of the face value of the bond at its maturity date will be discounted by the market interest rate. The resulting present value of those two amounts is the market value.
The semiannual interest payments are considered an annuity, since the bond's stated interest rate and the resulting interest payments do not change even though the market rates are changing each hour. The annuity consisting of the semiannual interest payments will be discounted by the current market interest rate (the rate an investor desires). The lump sum at maturity is a single payment and that too will be discounted by the same market rate used to discount the interest payments. The resulting present value of the lump sum plus the present value of the interest annuity will be the present value and the market value of the bond.
When market interest rates increase, the locked-in or fixed interest payments promised in the bond will become less attractive. Hence the present/market value of the bond will decline as the market demands higher interest payments. If market interest rates decrease, the locked-in or fixed interest payments promised in the bond will become more attractive and will result in a higher present/market value.
One caution for potential investors in bonds: Bonds will likely have a call feature. This means the issuer of the bond has the option to call in the bonds at a specified amount, such as 106% of its face value. This could mean a limit to the upside gain for an investor if interest rates decline. You should discuss this further with your financial adviser.",what
What is yield to maturity?,"Yield to maturity is the total return that will be earned by someone who purchases a bond and holds it until its maturity date. The yield to maturity might also be referred to as yield, internal rate of return, or the market interest rate at the time that the bond was purchased by the investor. The yield to maturity is expressed as an annual percentage rate.
To illustrate, let's assume that a 5% $100,000 bond will mature in 5 years and will pay interest each June 1 and December 1. Hence the bond will pay interest of $2,500 every six months until it matures. If the current market interest rate for this type of bond is 6%, the bond's current market value will be less than $100,000. The market value of a 5% bond in a 6% bond market will be approximately $95,735. This is the present value of the $2,500 of interest that will be received every six months for 5 years plus the present value of the $100,000 that will be received at the end of 5 years. (All of the cash amounts are discounted by the market interest rate. However, the 6% annual market rate will be restated to be 3% per semiannual period and the 5 years will be restated to be 10 semiannnual periods.)
The investor's yield to maturity will be the market rate of 6% (even though the bond's stated rate is 5%) consisting of the following two components:

the current yield of more than 5.2% because the investor is receiving cash of $2,500 every six months ($5,000 per year) on an investment of only $95,735.
a gain of $4,265 because the investor bought the bond for $95,735 but will receive cash of $100,000 at maturity.",what
What are term bonds and serial bonds?,"Term bonds are bonds which mature or come due on a single date.
Serial bonds are bonds which do not mature or come due on a single date. Instead, serial bonds have maturity dates which are staggered over several or many years. You could say that serial bonds come due over a series of dates.",what
What is the difference between an adjunct account and a contra account?,"Let's illustrate adjunct and contra accounts with bonds payable. If a corporation issues $100,000 of its bonds payable for a price of 97, it will be issuing the bonds at a discount of 3%. Its journal entry will include a debit to Cash for $97,000; a credit to Bonds Payable for $100,000; and a debit to Discount on Bonds Payable for $3,000. Discount on Bonds Payable is a contra account because it is a liability account with a debit amount. The carrying value of the bonds will begin at $97,000 since the $100,000 in Bonds Payable is offset by the $3,000 debit in Discount on Bonds Payable.
If a corporation issues $300,000 of bonds at a price of 102, it will be issuing the bonds at a premium of 2%. The journal entry will include a debit to Cash for $306,000; a credit to Bonds Payable for $300,000; and a credit to Premium on Bonds Payable for $6,000. Since a credit balance is the normal balance for a liability account, the account Premium on Bonds Payable cannot be referred to as a contra account. Here is where the term adjunct account is used. Immediately after the bonds are issued, the bonds will have a carrying value of $306,000 ($300,000 PLUS $6,000).
Some people might use the term adjunct accounts for both the Discount on Bonds Payable and for the Premium on Bonds Payable. Others might use the term valuation accounts.
Other examples of contra accounts include Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, Accumulated Depreciation, Discount on Notes Payable, Bond Issue Costs, Discount on Notes Receivable, LIFO Reserve, and certain investment accounts.",what
What is the tax advantage when bonds are issued instead of stock?,"The tax advantage of issuing bonds (or other debt) instead of stock results from the interest paid by the company being a deductible expense on its federal and state income tax returns. Dividends paid to stockholders are not a deductible expense, since dividends are a distribution of profits to the owners of the corporation.
The size of the advantage depends on the income tax rate of the company paying the interest. For example, if a corporation issues $10,000,000 of bonds with an interest rate of 8%, its annual interest expense will be $800,000. When the $800,000 of interest expense is entered on the corporation's income tax return, its taxable income will decrease by $800,000. If the corporation's combined federal and state income tax rate on this increment is 40%, the corporation will avoid or save paying income taxes of $320,000 ($800,000 of less taxable income X 40%). If the corporation's income tax rate on this increment is 30%, the corporation will save paying income taxes of $240,000 ($800,000 X 30%).
Due to the income tax savings, the cost of the borrowed money is reduced. For a corporation in the 40% tax bracket, its net cost of the borrowed money is $480,000 ($800,000 of interest minus $320,000 of income tax savings) for a net rate of 4.8% ($480,000 of net expense divided by $10,000,000). For a corporation with a combined tax rate of 30%, the net cost of the borrowed money will be $560,000 or a net rate of 5.6% of $10,000,000.",what
What is the stated interest rate of a bond payable?,"The stated interest rate of a bond payable is the annual interest rate that is printed on the face of the bond. The stated interest rate multiplied by the bond's face amount (or par amount) results in the annual amount of interest that must be paid by the issuer of the bond. For example, if a corporation issues $10,000,000 of bonds having a stated interest rate of 6%, it is promising to pay interest of $600,000 each year (usually $300,000 semiannually).
The stated interest rate of a bond payable is also known as the face interest rate, the nominal interest rate, the contractual interest rate, and the coupon interest rate.
Generally, a bond's stated interest rate is fixed (remains constant) for the life of the bond. As a result a bond's interest payments form an ordinary annuity for the life of the bond. On the other hand, the market interest rate for the bond will likely change often. A change in the market interest rate will cause the present value of the interest payments (and the present value of the maturity amount) to change in the opposite direction. For instance, when the market interest rate increases the present value of an existing bond will decrease.",what
What is present value?,"In accounting, present value likely refers to the amount that remains after future cash amounts have been discounted to an earlier time. (The earlier time is depicted on a timeline as the point 0, which is the beginning of period 1.) The discounting process involves removing the time value of money, future interest, etc. which is contained within the future cash amounts.
Accountants will record the present value when neither the cash amount, the cash equivalent amount, nor the fair market value of an item in a transaction is known.
Accountants will also calculate a present value to determine an implicit interest rate or the effective interest rate. For example, if a bond payable with a face value of $100,000 and a stated interest rate of 8% is issued for $99,000 the accountant will seek the interest rate which will discount the future semiannual interest amounts of $40,000 and the maturity value of $100,000 to be exactly $99,000 at the time that the bonds were issued. That rate is the effective interest rate and it will be used to determine each period's interest expense and the amount of the discount on bonds payable to be amortized in each period.",what
What is a lump sum payment?,"A lump sum payment is often associated with a single amount paid to acquire a group of items. For instance, a corporation might pay $50,000 for the inventory and equipment of a small manufacturer that is going out of business. The transaction did not specify any further details. The $50,000 is a lump sum payment.
Sometimes the term lump sum payment merely indicates a single payment. For example, the maturity value of a bond might be referred to as a lump sum payment in order to distinguish it from the series of semiannual interest payments.",what
How do you calculate the actual or real interest rate on a bond investment?,"The actual or real interest rate on a bond can be calculated by using present value software or a financial calculator. The actual, real, or effective interest rate is the rate that will discount all of the future cash receipts back to the amount of cash paid to buy the bond. This interest rate is also known as the yield to maturity, yield, and market interest rate.
The future cash receipts for a typical bond are the semiannual interest payments (interest rate stated on the bond X face amount of bond X 1/2 year) and the maturity amount of the bond. The interest payments form an ordinary annuity and the maturity amount is a single payment.
If the bond's stated interest rate is less than the current market interest rate, the bond's market value is less than the maturity or face amount of the bond. In financial jargon, the bond will sell at a discount.
If the bond's interest rate is more than the current market interest rate, the bond will have a market value that is more than the maturity or face amount of the bond. In other words, the bond will sell at a premium.",what
What is DCF?,"In accounting, DCF refers to discounted cash flows or to the discounted cash flow techniques such as net present value or internal rate of return.
DCF is a preferred method for evaluating capital expenditures (and other investments) because DCF recognizes the time value of money. In other words, it recognizes that receiving $10,000 of cash today is more valuable than receiving $10,000 of cash in the future. Similarly, $10,000 cash receipt in Year 10 is less valuable than a $10,000 cash receipt in Year 7.
The recognition of the time value of money occurs by discounting the related future cash flows back to the time when cash is invested. (The date that the cash is invested is often referred to as the ""present"" or the very beginning of the investment's first year.)
The greater the time value of money, the greater will be the amount of the discount. The smaller the time value of money, the smaller the amount of the discount. In turn, a larger discount will mean a smaller present value. A smaller discount will result in a greater present value.
DCF is also useful for calculating the approximate market value of bonds payable, a product line, or entire companies.",what
"If a company issues stocks or bonds to pay outstanding debt, should this noncash transaction be included in the cash flow statement?","If a company issues stocks or bonds for cash and then pays off the debt, the transaction is reported in the financing section of the statement of cash flows.
If the transaction is a direct conversion of debt to equity (shares of stock) or debt to bonds and no cash receipts or cash payments occur, the transaction is to be disclosed as supplementary information.
This situation and other noncash financing and investing activities are described in Paragraph 32 of the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows, available at www.FASB.org/st.",what
What is a basis point?,"A basis point is a hundredth (1/100) of a percentage point. Expressed another way, one percentage point is equal to 100 basis points. This means that if an interest rate drops by 1/2 of a percentage point (such as from 4% to 3.5%), the drop is 50 basis points. If an interest rate increases from 3.75% to 3.90%, the increase is 15 basis points.",what
What is an ordinary annuity?,"In accounting, an ordinary annuity refers to a series of identical cash amounts with each amount occurring at the end of equal time intervals.
An example of an ordinary annuity is the series of semiannual interest payments that are part of a bond payable. For instance, a 10-year bond with a maturity amount of $10 million and a stated interest rate of 6% will require interest payments of $300,000 at the end of each of the 20 six-month time intervals.
Another example of an ordinary annuity is a mortgage loan having a fixed interest rate and a series of equal monthly payments that will begin 30 days after the loan is granted. Thus a 15-year mortgage loan will result in an ordinary annuity of 180 equal monthly payments with the first payment due approximately 30 days after the loan is made.
An ordinary annuity is also known as an annuity in arrears.",what
What is an annuity in present value calculations?,"In present value calculations, an annuity is a series of equal cash amounts occurring at equal time intervals. The identical cash amounts are sometimes referred to as payments, receipts, or rent.
Some examples of business transactions that form an annuity include:

The equal amounts of interest paid every six months by the issuer of debt securities known as bonds.
The monthly payments required by a lease agreement for equipment or a vehicle.
The annual payments required by a purchase agreement.

The annuity payments are often discounted to arrive at their present value. The annuity payments can also be used to determine the effective interest rate that is embedded in an agreement.
Depending on the starting point of the first payment, an annuity will be further identified as an ordinary annuity, an annuity in advance, a deferred annuity, etc.",what
"What does it mean to amortize the premium, discount, and issue costs on bonds payable?","With regards to bonds payable, the term amortize means to systematically allocate the discount on bonds payable, the premium on bonds payable, and the bond issue costs to Interest Expense over the remaining life of the bonds. (Bonds are likely to mature in 10 years or more.)
The term amortize is conceptually similar to the term depreciate, except that depreciate is used when allocating the cost of a plant asset to expense.
Unless the discount, premium, and issue costs are insignificant, the amounts are to be spread to Interest Expense over the remaining life of the bond. The most precise way to amortize these is to use the effective interest rate method. A less precise method is the straight-line amortization method, which is often an acceptable alternative.",what
What is the definition of capital market?,"Often, capital market refers to the structured market for trading stocks and bonds. Examples are the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, and the New York Bond Exchange.
However, capital market can also include less structured markets such as private placements for stocks, bonds, and other debt.",what
What is a debenture?,"A debenture is an unsecured bond. In other words, a debenture is a bond without a lien on specific assets owned by the issuing corporation.",what
What conditions cause a discount on bonds payable?,"Discount on bonds payable occurs when a bond's stated interest rate is less than the bond market's interest rate.
If a $1,000,000 bond issue promises to pay interest of 8% per year and the bond market demands 8.125%, the bonds will sell for less than $1,000,000. The difference between the $1,000,000 of face value and the amount the bond market is willing to pay is the discount on bonds payable.
The amount of the discount is a function of 1) the number of years before the bonds mature, and 2) the difference in the bond's stated interest rate and the market's interest rate.",what
What is the book value of bonds payable?,"The book value of bonds payable is also referred to as the carrying value of bonds payable. The book value of bonds payable consists of the following amounts, all of which are found in bond-related liability accounts:

The face value of the bonds (which is a credit balance in the account Bonds Payable)
The related unamortized discount (which is a debit balance in the contra-liability account Discount on Bonds Payable)
The related unamortized premium (which is a credit balance in the adjunct-liability account Premium on Bonds Payable)
The related unamortized bond issue costs (which is a debit balance in the contra-liability account Bond Issue Costs)

It important that the discount, premium, and issue costs are amortized properly up to the moment when the book value of the bonds is needed.
[Prior to 2016, U.S. companies had reported the unamortized bond issue costs as a long-term deferred asset.]",what
What is the face value of a bond payable?,"The face value or face amount of a bond payable is the amount printed on the bond. The face value is also referred to as the par value, stated value, maturity value, principal amount, and legal amount.
The face value is used to calculate the cash interest payments required during the life of the bond, and it indicates the cash amount that must be paid at the maturity date. For example, if a corporation issues a bond payable having a face value of $1,000,000 and a stated interest rate of 6% per year, it is likely that the bond issuer is obliged to pay the following:

$30,000 of interest every six months until the bond matures ($1,000,000 X 6% X 6/12)
$1,000,000 at the maturity date of the bond

At the time the corporation issues a bond for cash, the long-term (noncurrent) liability account Bonds Payable will be credited with the face value of the bond. Cash will be debited for the cash received, and any difference will be recorded in one or two of the following bond-related liability accounts:

A debit to Discount on Bonds Payable
A credit to Premium on Bonds Payable
A debit to Bond Issue Costs

Between the date that a bond is issued and the date that the bond matures, the discount, premium, and/or issue costs must be amortized to the account Interest Expense. On the maturity date, the maturity value will be removed when the bond issuer's $1,000,000 payment is made to the one or more bondholders.",what
Why do bonds rarely sell for their maturity value?,"The reasons why bonds rarely sell for their maturity value are:

The interest paid is usually fixed at the interest rate that is stated on the face of the bond. As a result, the amount of interest paid each year does not change during the life of the bond.
The market interest rate—the rate that bond buyers demand—is changing daily.

To illustrate, let's assume that a 6% bond will mature in ten years and has a maturity value of $100,000. This means that the bondholders will be receiving $6,000 in interest in each of the ten years. If there is a day when the bond buyers demand an interest rate of 6.2% then the bond's value on that day will be less than $100,000. If on another day the bond buyers demand 5.9% interest, the bond's value on that day will be greater than $100,000.",what
Why are bonds payable less costly than common stock?,"Bonds payable are less costly than common stock because the bonds issued by a corporation contain a formal contract to pay the investor a fixed amount of interest every six months and to pay the face or principal amount when the bonds mature. The contract to pay these cash amounts to the investors makes bonds a less risky investment than common stock. Less risk for the investor means the investor will earn a smaller return—and the corporation will have a smaller cost.  Some bonds might also provide collateral and some bonds might require that a sinking fund be established to set aside money to pay the bondholders when the bonds come due. These features will further reduce the investor's risk and should further reduce the corporation's cost.
Another reason why bonds are less costly than common stock is that the  interest paid by the corporation will be deductible on the corporation's income tax return. If a corporation's combined federal and state income tax rate is 35%, then $100,000 of interest expense will save the corporation $35,000 of income taxes. This means that a corporation's ultimate or net cost of a 10% bond is only 6.5%.",what
What is a general ledger account?,"Definition of General Ledger Account
A general ledger account is an account or record used to sort, store and summarize a company's transactions. These accounts are arranged in the general ledger (and in the chart of accounts) with the balance sheet accounts appearing first followed by the income statement accounts.
Examples of General Ledger Accounts
Some of the more common balance sheet accounts and how they are further arranged in the general ledger include:

asset accounts such as Cash, Accounts Receivable, Inventory, Investments, Land, and Equipment
liability accounts including Notes Payable, Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses Payable, and Customer Deposits
stockholders' equity accounts such as Common Stock, Retained Earnings, Treasury Stock, and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

Some of the general ledger income statement accounts and how they are arranged include:

operating revenue accounts such as Sales and Service Fee Revenues
operating expense accounts including Salaries Expense, Rent Expense, and Advertising Expense
nonoperating or other income accounts such as Gain on Sale of Assets, Interest Expense, and Loss on Disposal of Assets

General Ledger Control Accounts
Some general ledger accounts can become summary records and will be referred to as control accounts. In that situation all of the detail that supports the summary amounts in one of the control accounts will be available in a subsidiary ledger.
Examples of General Ledger Control Accounts
A common example of a general ledger account that can become a control account is Accounts Receivable. The summary amounts are found in the Accounts Receivable control account and the details for each customer's credit activity will be contained in the Accounts Receivable subsidiary ledger.
Other general ledger accounts that may become control accounts include Inventory, Equipment, and Accounts Payable.",what
What is the difference between accounts payable and accounts receivable?,"Definition of Accounts Payable
Accounts payable is a current liability account in which a company records the amounts it owes to suppliers or vendors for goods or services that it received on credit.
Definition of Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable is a current asset account in which a company records the amounts it has a right to collect from customers who received goods or services on credit.
Examples of Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable
Let's assume that Company A sells merchandise to Company B on credit (with payment due 30 days later). Company A will record the amount of the sale with a credit to Sales and a debit to Accounts Receivable. Company B will record the purchase (perhaps as inventory) with a credit to Accounts Payable.
When the amount of the credit sale is remitted, Company B will debit its liability Accounts Payable and will credit Cash. Company A will debit Cash and will credit its current asset Accounts Receivable.
Symmetry with Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable
Our examples show that there are two sides to every transaction (which some people refer to as symmetry).
At the time of the sale:

Company A reported a sale and a current asset, and
Company B reported a purchase and a current liability

At the time of payment:

Company A's Cash increased and its Accounts Receivable decreased
Company B's Cash decreased and its Accounts Payable decreased

Balance Sheet: Retail/Wholesale - Corporation",what
What are accruals?,"Definition of Accruals
The accounting and bookkeeping term accruals refers to adjustments that must be made before a company's financial statements are issued. Accruals involve the following types of business transactions:

expenses, losses, and liabilities that have been incurred but are not yet recorded in the accounts, and
revenues and assets that have been earned but are not yet recorded in the accounts

Example of an Accrual of an Expense
One example of an accrual of an expense and liability is a major repair that occurs in the final month of the accounting year, but is not paid until the bill is received in the first month of the following year. For the current year's financial statements to be complete (under the accrual method of accounting) the following is necessary:

the income statement for the current year must report the repair expense, and
the balance sheet as of the last day of the year must report the related liability

To record this accrual, an adjusting entry is made that debits Repairs Expense and credits Accrued Expenses Payable. 
Example of an Accrual of Revenues
One example of an accrual of revenues occurs at your electric utility company. For instance, during December the utility likely uses natural gas and/or coal plus many employees to generate the electricity used by its customers in December. However, the utility does not bill its customers for that electricity until after it reads the meters in January. As a result, the utility's financial statements will need an accrual adjustment so that:

its income statement for the month of December and for the current year will report all of the revenues earned by the utility, and
its December 31 balance sheet will report a current asset for the amount it has a right to receive from its customers (including the amount for the electricity it provided in December)

The accrual adjustment will debit the current asset account Accrued Receivables and will credit the income statement account Accrued Electricity Revenues.",what
What is the difference between wages and salary?,"You should be aware that some people use the terms wages and salary interchangeably. I and many others make the following distinction...
Definition of Wages
Wages are usually associated with employee compensation that is based on the number of hours worked multiplied by an hourly rate of pay. Generally, the employees earning hourly wages will be paid in the week that follows the hours worked.
Example of Wages
For example, a warehouse employee works 40 hours during the work week. If the employee's hourly rate of pay is $15, on the 5th day following the work week, the employee will receive a paycheck showing gross wages of $600 (40 x $15). If the employee had worked only 30 hours during the work week, the paycheck will show gross wages of $450 (30 x $15).
Definition of Salary
Salary is associated with employee compensation quoted on an annual basis, such as $50,000 per year. Many employees working in a company's general office will be paid a salary. Often the salaries are paid semi-monthly. That is, one pay date will be the 15th day of the month for working from the 1st to the 15th, and the other pay date will be the last day of the month for working from the 16th to the last day of the month.
Example of Salary
To illustrate, let's assume that the manager of a company might earn a salary of $120,000 per year. If the manager is paid semi-monthly each paycheck will show a gross salary of $5,000 for half a month's work.
Overtime Pay
U.S. and state law protects employees from having to work more than 40 hours per week when their wages or salary is below a certain level. In other words, a salaried employee with a relatively low annual salary must be given overtime compensation if the person's hours worked are greater than 40 hours per week. You should be aware of the federal and state laws for your employees' overtime compensation.",what
What is the cost of goods sold?,"Definition of Cost of Goods Sold
The cost of goods sold is the cost of the products that a retailer, distributor, or manufacturer has sold.
The cost of goods sold is reported on the income statement and should be viewed as an expense of the accounting period. In essence, the cost of goods sold is being matched with the revenues from the goods sold, thereby achieving the matching principle of accounting.
When the cost of goods sold is subtracted from net sales, the result is the company's gross profit.
Examples of Calculating the Cost of Goods Sold
One way to calculate a retailer's cost of goods sold is to begin with the cost of the goods it had purchased during the accounting period and then adjust it for the change in inventory. For example, if 1,000 units of a company's only product were purchased but its inventory increased by 100 units, then the cost of 900 units will be the cost of goods sold. If 1,000 units of the product were purchased but the inventory decreased by 100 units then the cost of 1,100 units will be the cost of goods sold.
Using dollar amounts, let's assume that a retailer's cost of its merchandise purchases for a year was $300,000 while the cost of its inventory increased from $100,000 to $120,000. The result is that its cost of goods sold is $280,000 (purchases of $300,000 minus the $20,000 increase in inventory).
A second way to calculate the cost of goods sold is: the cost of the beginning inventory + the cost of goods purchased = cost of goods available - cost of ending inventory. Using the amounts above, we have $100,000 + $300,000 = $400,000 - $120,000 = $280,000.
If the cost of the ending inventory were $65,000, the cost of goods sold would have been $335,000 (purchases of $300,000 + the $35,000 decrease in inventory). 
Cost Flow Assumption Is Needed
When costs change during the accounting period, a cost flow will have to be assumed. Some common cost flow assumptions include FIFO, LIFO, and average.",what
What is the significance of FOB Shipping Point and FOB Destination?,"Significance of FOB Shipping Point and FOB Destination
The terms FOB shipping point and FOB destination have significance in accounting because they determine the following:

When a sale of goods and the related receivable occur
When the purchase of goods and the related liability occur
Whether the seller or buyer pays the shipping costs

If the seller of goods quotes a price that is FOB shipping point, the sale takes place when the seller puts the goods on a common carrier at the seller's dock. Therefore, when the goods are being transported to the buyer, they are owned by the buyer and the buyer is responsible for the shipping costs.
If a seller of goods quotes a price that is FOB destination, the sale takes place when they are unloaded at the buyer's destination. This means that the seller owns the goods while they are on the truck and the seller is responsible for the shipping costs.
Example of FOB Shipping Point
Assume that a seller quoted a price of $900 FOB shipping point and the seller loaded the goods onto a common carrier on December 30. Also assume that the goods are in transit until they arrive at the buyer's location on January 2. On December 30, the seller should record a sale, an account receivable, and a reduction in its inventory.
The buyer should record the purchase, the account payable, and the increase in its inventory as of December 30 (the date that the purchase took place). Since the goods on the truck belong to the buyer, the buyer should pay the shipping costs. These shipping costs will be an additional cost of the goods purchased.
Example of FOB Destination
Now assume that a seller quoted $975 FOB destination and the seller loaded the goods onto a common carrier on December 30. Also assume that the goods are on the truck until January 2, when they are unloaded at the buyer's location. On December 31, the goods were owned by the seller. Therefore, the seller should continue to report these goods in its inventory until January 2. The seller will be responsible for the shipping costs, which will be an expense in January when the sale is reported.
The buyer records the purchase, accounts payable, and the increase in inventory on January 2 when the buyer becomes the owner of the goods.",what
What is petty cash?,"Definition of Petty Cash
Petty cash or a petty cash fund is a small amount of money available for paying small expenses without writing a check. Petty Cash is also the title of the general ledger current asset account that reports the amount of the company's petty cash. The amount of petty cash will vary by company and may be in the range of $30 to $300.
The petty cash is controlled through the use of a petty cash voucher for each payment made. The expenses will be recorded in the company's general ledger expense accounts when the petty cash on hand is replenished.
Examples of Petty Cash Payments
Some examples of small payments made from petty cash include:

Paying the mail carrier 30 cents for the postage due on a letter
Reimbursing an employee $9 for supplies purchased
Reimbursing an employee for purchasing $14 of bakery goods for an early morning meeting


Shown above is an example of a petty cash voucher.",what
What is a trial balance?,"Definition of a Trial Balance
A trial balance is a bookkeeping or accounting report that lists the balances in each of an organization's general ledger accounts. (Often the accounts with zero balances will not be listed.) The debit balance amounts are listed in a column with the heading ""Debit balances"" and the credit balance amounts are listed in another column with the heading ""Credit balances."" The total of each of these two columns should be identical.
Examples of the Trial Balance's Use
The trial balance is not a financial statement. It is mainly an internal report that is/was useful in a manual accounting system. If the trial balance did not ""balance"" it signaled an error somewhere between the journal and the trial balance. Often the cause of the difference was a miscalculation of an account balance, posting a debit amount as a credit (or vice versa), transposing digits within an amount when posting or preparing the trial balance, etc.
Today's accounting software has been written to eliminate those errors. Hence, the trial balance is less important for bookkeeping purposes since it is almost certain that the general ledger and the trial balance will have the debits equal to the credits.
The trial balance continues to be useful for auditors and accountants who wish to show 1) the general ledger account balances prior to their proposed adjustments, 2) their proposed adjustments, and 3) all of the account balances after the proposed adjustments. The adjusted amounts make up the adjusted trial balance, and the adjusted amounts will be used in the organization's financial statements.",what
What is a journal entry?,"Definition of a Journal Entry
In manual accounting or bookkeeping systems, business transactions are first recorded in a journal...hence the term journal entry.
Journal entries that are recorded in a company's general journal will consist of the following:

the appropriate date
the account(s) and amount(s) that will be debited
the account(s) and amount(s) that will be credited
a short description/memo/reference

The journal entries appear in a journal in order by date and are then posted to the appropriate accounts in the general ledger.
Computerized accounting systems will automatically record most of the business transactions into the general ledger accounts immediately after the software prepares the sales invoices, issues checks to creditors, processes receipts from customers, etc. Hence, we will not write journal entries for most of the business transactions.
Examples of Journal Entries
Even with computerized accounting systems some general journal entries are necessary. Common general journal entries are the adjusting entries. For example, prior to issuing the company's financial statements there will be an adjusting entry to record depreciation. This journal entry will debit Depreciation Expense and will credit Accumulated Depreciation.
Another example of a general journal entry is the adjusting entry to accrue interest on a bank loan. This journal entry will debit Interest Expense and will credit Interest Payable.",what
What are accrued expenses and when are they recorded?,"Accrued Expenses
Accrued expenses are expenses that have occurred but are not yet recorded in the company's general ledger. This means these expenses will not appear on the financial statements unless an adjusting entry is entered prior to issuing the financial statements.
Example of an Accrued Expense
To illustrate an accrued expense, let's assume that a company borrowed $200,000 on December 1. The agreement requires that the company repay the $200,000 on February 28 along with $6,000 of interest for the three months of December through February. As of December 31, the company will not have an invoice to process and will not be paying the interest until it is due on February 28.
Recording an Accrued Expense
Without an adjusting entry to accrue the interest expense that was incurred by the company in December, the company's financial statements as of December 31 will not be reporting the $2,000 of interest (one-third of the $6,000) that the company has incurred in December. In order for the financial statements to be correct on the accrual basis of accounting, the accountant must record an adjusting entry dated as of December 31. The adjusting entry will consist of a debit of $2,000 to Interest Expense (an income statement account) and a credit of $2,000 to Interest Payable (a balance sheet account).

What are prepaid expenses?,"Definition of Prepaid Expenses
Prepaid expenses are future expenses that have been paid in advance. In other words, prepaid expenses are costs that have been paid but are not yet used up or have not yet expired.
Generally, the amount of prepaid expenses that will be used up within one year are reported on a company's balance sheet as a current asset. As the amount expires, the current asset is reduced and the amount of the reduction is reported as an expense on the income statement.
Example of Prepaid Expenses
A common prepaid expense is the six-month insurance premium that is paid in advance for insurance coverage on a company's vehicles. The amount paid is often recorded in the current asset account Prepaid Insurance. If the company issues monthly financial statements, its income statement will report Insurance Expense which is one-sixth of the six-month premium. The balance in the account Prepaid Insurance will be the amount that is still prepaid as of the date of the balance sheet.",what
What is equity?,"Definitions and Examples of Equity
Equity has several definitions that pertain to accounting:



Equity can indicate an ownership interest in a business, such as stockholders' equity or owner's equity.
Equity can mean the combination of liabilities and owner's equity. For example, the basic accounting equation Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity can be restated to be Assets = Equities.
Equity can mean an owner's interest in a personal asset. For example, the owner of a $200,000 house that has a mortgage loan of $75,000 is said to have $125,000 of equity in the house.

What is the cost of sales?,"Definition of Cost of Sales
Cost of sales is often a line shown on a manufacturer's or retailer's income statement instead of cost of goods sold.
The cost of sales for a manufacturer is the cost of its finished goods in its beginning inventory plus the cost of goods manufactured during the accounting period minus the cost of finished goods in ending inventory.
The cost of sales for a retailer is the cost of merchandise in its beginning inventory plus the net cost of merchandise purchased during the accounting period minus the cost of merchandise in its ending inventory.
The cost of sales does not include selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, or interest expense.",what
What is the difference between a general ledger and a general journal?,"Definition of General Ledger
The general ledger contains the accounts used to sort and store a company's transactions.
The general ledger is organized so that the accounts will appear in the following order: 

Balance sheet accounts: assets, liabilities, stockholders' equity
Income statement accounts: operating revenues, operating expenses, other revenues and gains, other expenses and losses

The balances and activity in the general ledger accounts are used to prepare a company's financial statements.
Definition of General Journal
A general journal is used to record unique journal entries that cannot be processed in a more efficient manner. For example, checks written, sales invoices issued, purchase invoices received, and others can be recorded in a computerized accounting system when the documents are processed. Manual accounting systems will likely use special journals for recording routine transactions. Therefore, the general journal will have a limited amount of entries. 
In the general journal you must enter the account(s) to be debited and the account(s) to be credited along with their amounts and a brief description. Once a transaction is recorded in the general journal, the amounts are then posted to the appropriate accounts in the general ledger.
Examples of Using the General Journal
The following are examples of entries that will be recorded in the general journal:

Depreciation
Other adjusting entries
Bad debts
Sale of an asset used in the business",what
What is the purpose of control accounts?,"Definition of Control Account
A control account is a general ledger account containing only summary amounts. The details for each control account will be found in a related (but separate) subsidiary ledger.
The control account keeps the general ledger free of details, but still has the correct balance for preparing the company's financial statements.
Example of Control Accounts
A common example of a control account is the general ledger account entitled Accounts Receivable. When it is used as a control account, it will contain only summary amounts, such as total credit sales for a day, total collections from customers for a day, total returns and allowances for a day, and the total amount owed by all customers.
Hence, if you want to find the amount that a specific customer still owes for its purchases on credit, it will not be shown in the control account. To find the amount that a specific customer owes, its recent payments, and its recent purchases on credit, you will quickly get that information from the Accounts Receivable Subsidiary Ledger.
Control accounts could also be used for accounts payable, equipment, and inventory.",what
What is the three-way match?,"Definition of Three-Way Match
In the accounting and bookkeeping area of accounts payable, the three-way match refers to a procedure used when processing an invoice received from a vendor or supplier. The purpose of the three-way match is to avoid paying an incorrect and perhaps fraudulent invoice.
Example of Three-Way Match
The ""three-way"" part of the three-way match refers to the three documents that will be compared:

The vendor's invoice that was received and will become part of an organization's accounts payable when it is approved
The purchase order that was prepared by the organization
The receiving report that was prepared by the organization

The ""match"" part of the three-way match refers to comparing the quantities, price per unit, terms, and other information appearing on the three documents. In other words, does the vendor's invoice detail agree with the organization's purchase order, and to the goods actually received as shown on the organization's receiving report? Only if the details on the three documents are in agreement will the vendor's invoice be entered as an account payable.
The three-way match is an important step in safeguarding an organization's assets.",what
What is a liability?,"Definition of Liability
A liability is an obligation arising from a past business event. It is reported on a company's balance sheet.
Liabilities are also part of the basic accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders' Equity. Liabilities are often viewed as claims against the company's assets. However, liabilities can also be viewed as sources of the company's assets.
Examples of a Liability
Examples of a liability include:

accounts payable
loans payable
wages payable
interest payable
customer deposits
deferred revenues",what
What is a journal?,"Definition of a Journal
In accounting and bookkeeping, a journal is a record of financial transactions in order by date. Traditionally, a journal has been defined as the book of original entry. The definition was more appropriate when transactions were written in a journal prior to manually posting them to the accounts in the general ledger or subsidiary ledger. 
Examples of Journals in a Manual Accounting System
Manual systems usually had a variety of journals such as a sales journal, purchases journal, cash receipts journal, cash disbursements journal, and a general journal.
Computerized Accounting Systems
With today's computerized accounting systems, the recording and posting of most transactions will occur automatically when sales and vendor invoice information is entered, checks are written, etc. In other words, accounting software has eliminated the need to first record routine transactions into a journal. However, even with computerized accounting systems it is necessary to have a general journal in which adjusting entries and unique financial transactions are recorded.",what
What is the difference between product costs and period costs?,"A manufacturer's product costs are the direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead used in making its products. (Manufacturing overhead is also referred to as factory overhead, indirect manufacturing costs, and burden.) The product costs of direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead are also ""inventoriable"" costs, since these are the necessary costs of manufacturing the products.
Period costs are not a necessary part of the manufacturing process. As a result, period costs cannot be assigned to the products or to the cost of inventory. The period costs are usually associated with the selling function of the business or its general administration. The period costs are reported as expenses in the accounting period in which they 1) best match with revenues, 2) when they expire, or 3) in the current accounting period. In addition to the selling and general administrative expenses, most interest expense is a period expense.",what
What is accumulated depreciation?,"Definition of Accumulated Depreciation
Accumulated depreciation is the total amount of a plant asset's cost that has been allocated to depreciation expense (or to manufacturing overhead) since the asset was put into service. Accumulated depreciation (and the related depreciation expense) are associated with constructed assets such as buildings, machinery, office equipment, furniture, fixtures, vehicles, etc.
Accumulated Depreciation is also the title of the contra asset account. Accumulated Depreciation is credited when Depreciation Expense is debited each accounting period.
Subtracting accumulated depreciation from an asset's cost results in the asset's book value or carrying value. Hence, the credit balance in the account Accumulated Depreciation cannot exceed the debit balance in the related asset account.
Example of Accumulated Depreciation
Assume that a company purchased a delivery vehicle for $50,000 and determined that the depreciation expense should be $9,000 for 5 years. Each year the account Accumulated Depreciation will be credited for $9,000. Since this is a balance sheet account, its balance keeps accumulating. Therefore, after three years the balance in Accumulated Depreciation will be a credit balance of $27,000 and the vehicle's book value will be $23,000 ($50,000 minus $27,000).
It is important to note that an asset's book value does not indicate the vehicle's market value since depreciation is merely an allocation technique.
If the vehicle is sold, both the vehicle's cost and its accumulated depreciation at the date of the sale will be removed from the accounts. If the amount received is greater than the book value, a gain will be recorded. If the amount received is less than the book value, a loss is recorded.",what
What is meant by reconciling an account?,"Definition of Reconciling an Account
Reconciling an account is likely to mean proving or documenting that an account balance is correct.
Examples of Reconciling an Account
When a company reconciles its bank statement, it is reconciling the balance in its general ledger account Cash (or Cash: Checking Account) with the bank's information.
Prior to issuing a company's financial statements, it is wise to reconcile every balance sheet account by collecting the information that supports the accounts' ending balances. For example, the Accounts Receivable balance could begin by comparing the balance with an aging of the accounts receivable. 
Another example is reconciling the balance in the general ledger account Utilities Payable. This might be accomplished by computing the daily cost of each utility that the company uses. The cost per day is then multiplied by the number of days since the last meter reading date shown on the utility bills that have already been recorded.",what
What is the provision for bad debts?,"Definition of Provision for Bad Debts
The provision for bad debts could refer to the balance sheet account also known as the Allowance for Bad Debts, Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, or Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts. If so, the account Provision for Bad Debts is a contra asset account (an asset account with a credit balance). It is used along with the account Accounts Receivable in order for the balance sheet to report the net realizable value of the company's accounts receivable. The entry to increase the credit balance in these contra accounts is a debit to the income statement account Bad Debts Expense.
Some companies might use the description provision for bad debts on its income statement in order to report the credit losses that pertain to the period of the income statement. In that case, provision for bad debts would be an income statement account. However, the U.S. accounting textbooks are more likely to use Bad Debts Expense or Uncollectible Accounts Expense to describe the amount reported on the income statement.",what
Why is depreciation on the income statement different from the depreciation on the balance sheet?,"Definition of Depreciation
Depreciation is the systematic allocation of an asset's cost to expense over the useful life of the asset.
Example of Depreciation
Let's assume that a retailer purchased displays for its store at a cost of $120,000. The displays have a useful life of 10 years and will have no salvage value. The straight-line method of depreciation will result in depreciation of $1,000 per month ($120,000 divided by 120 months). The monthly journal entry to record the depreciation will be a debit of $1,000 to the income statement account Depreciation Expense and a credit of $1,000 to the balance sheet contra asset account Accumulated Depreciation.
Depreciation on the Income Statement
The depreciation reported on the income statement is the amount of depreciation expense that is appropriate for the period of time indicated in the heading of the income statement. 
Using our example, the monthly income statements will report $1,000 of depreciation expense. The quarterly income statements will report $3,000 of depreciation expense, and the annual income statements will report $12,000 of depreciation expense. Each month $1,000 of depreciation expense is being matched to the 120 monthly income statements during which the displays are used to generate sales revenues.
Depreciation on the Balance Sheet
The depreciation reported on the balance sheet is the accumulated or the cumulative total amount of depreciation that has been reported as depreciation expense on the income statement from the time the assets were acquired until the date of the balance sheet.
Using our example, after one month of use the accumulated depreciation for the displays will be $1,000. After 24 months of use, the accumulated depreciation reported on the balance sheet will be $24,000. After 120 months, the accumulated depreciation reported on the balance sheet will be $120,000. At that point, the depreciation will stop since the displays' cost of $120,000 has been fully depreciated. If the displays continue to be used in the 11th year, there will be no depreciation expense in the 11th year and the accumulated depreciation will continue to be $120,000.",what
What does debit memo mean on a bank statement?,"Definition of Bank Debit Memo
A debit memo on a company's bank statement refers to a deduction by the bank from the company's bank account. In other words, a bank debit memo reduces the bank account balance similar to a check drawn on the bank account.
Examples of a Bank Debit Memo
Some examples of a bank debit memo include the following withdrawals from a company's checking account:

The company's monthly loan payment
The fee for printing the company's checks
The fee for handling a check that the company deposited and the check was returned because of insufficient funds
A transfer of funds to another account at the bank

The bank's use of the term debit memo is logical because the company's bank account is a liability in the bank's general ledger. (The bank accepted the company's cash which is recorded by a debit to the bank's Cash account, and the bank credits its liability account Customer Deposit Accounts. The liability is appropriate since the bank has the obligation to return the customer's money on demand). The bank's liability is reduced when the bank charges the company's account for a bank fee. Hence, the credit balance in the bank's liability account is reduced by a debit.
In the company's general ledger, the bank debit memo will reduce the company's checking account (which is an asset) and will require the company to credit its Cash account (and debit another account such as Bank Fees Expense).",what
What is the meaning of debit?,"Definition of Debit
The term debit is similar to the term used in Italy more than 500 years ago when the double entry accounting system was documented. What you need to know today is that debit means left or left side. For example, every accounting entry will have a debit entered on the left side of a general ledger account. (There will also need to be a credit amount entered on the right side of another account.) The abbreviation for debit is dr. (which is also related to the term from 500 years ago).
Since the general ledger accounts have both a debit and credit side, or left and right side, the balance in a general ledger account will be either a debit balance or a credit balance.
Within the general ledger, these accounts are expected to have debit balances: assets, expenses, and the owner's drawing account. The debit balances will be increased when additional debit amounts are entered, and will be decreased when credit amounts are entered.
Examples of Debit
To illustrate the term debit, let's assume that a company has cash of $500. Therefore, the company's general ledger asset account Cash should indicate a debit balance of $500. If the company receives an additional $200, a debit of $200 will be entered and will result in the Cash account having a debit balance of $700.
Sometimes the word charge is used in place of debit. For example, if a company spends $300 for advertising, a credit of $300 will be recorded in the Cash account, and an accountant might add ""...and charge Advertising Expense for $300."" Another accountant might say ""...and debit Advertising Expense for $300.""",what
What is retained earnings?,"Definition of Retained Earnings
Retained earnings is the cumulative amount of earnings since the corporation was formed minus the cumulative amount of dividends that were declared. Retained earnings is the corporation's past earnings that have not been distributed as dividends to its stockholders.
Are Retained Earnings an Asset?
The amount of a corporation's retained earnings is reported as a separate line within the stockholders' equity section of the balance sheet. However, the past earnings that have not been distributed as dividends to the stockholders will likely be reinvested in additional income-producing assets or used to reduce the corporation's liabilities. 
Where do Retained Earnings Come From?
At the end of an accounting year, the balances in a corporation's revenue, gain, expense, and loss accounts are used to compute the year's net income. Those account balances are then transferred to the Retained Earnings account. When the year's revenues and gains exceed the expenses and losses, the corporation will have a positive net income which causes the balance in the Retained Earnings account to increase. (If the corporation's revenues and gains for the year are less than the expenses and losses, the result is a net loss that reduces the normal credit balance in the Retained Earnings account.) The balance in the Retained Earnings account is also decreased when the corporation declares a cash dividend. 
What is the Normal Balance in the Retained Earnings Account?
The normal balance in a profitable corporation's Retained Earnings account is a credit balance. This is logical since the revenue accounts have credit balances and expense accounts have debit balances. If the balance in the Retained Earnings account has a debit balance, this negative amount of retained earnings may be described as deficit or accumulated deficit.",what
What is a contra asset account?,"Definition of Contra Asset Account
A contra asset account is an asset account where the account balance is a credit balance. It is described as ""contra"" because having a credit balance in an asset account is contrary to the normal or expected debit balance. (A debit balance in a contra asset account will violate the cost principle.)
Examples of Contra Asset Accounts
The most common contra asset account is Accumulated Depreciation. Accumulated Depreciation is associated with property, plant and equipment (plant assets). Accumulated Depreciation will be credited when Depreciation Expense is recorded. The credit balance in Accumulated Depreciation means that the cost of the property, plant and equipment will continue to be reported. Looking at the cost of the plant assets and the credit balance in Accumulated Depreciation allows us to see how much of the plant assets' cost has been depreciated and how much has not been depreciated.
Another contra asset account is Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. This account appears next to the current asset Accounts Receivable. The account Allowance for Doubtful Account is credited when the account Bad Debts Expense is debited under the allowance method. The use of Allowance for Doubtful Accounts allows us to see in Accounts Receivable the total amount that the company has a right to collect from its credit customers. The credit balance in the account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts tells us how much of the debit balance in Accounts Receivable is unlikely to be collected.
A less common example of a contra asset account is Discount on Notes Receivable. The credit balance in this account is amortized or allocated to Interest Income or Interest Revenue over the life of a note receivable.",what
What is a suspense account?,"Definition of Suspense Account
A suspense account is a general ledger account in which amounts are temporarily recorded. The suspense account is used because the appropriate general ledger account could not be determined at the time that the transaction was recorded.
As soon as possible, the amount(s) in the suspense account should be moved to the proper account(s).
Example of Using a Suspense Account
An accountant was instructed to record a significant number of journal entries written by the controller of a large company. Unfortunately, there was one amount that did not have an account designated. In order to complete the assignment by the deadline, the accountant recorded the ""mystery"" amount in the general ledger Suspense account. When the controller is available, the accountant will get clarification and will move the amount from the Suspense account to the appropriate account.",what
What is a credit memo?,"Definition of Credit Memo
One type of credit memo is issued by a seller in order to reduce the amount that a customer owes from a previously issued sales invoice. Another type of credit memo, or credit memorandum, is issued by a bank when it increases a depositor's checking account for a certain transaction.
Example of a Credit Memo
Assume that SellerCorp had issued a sales invoice for $800 for 100 units of product that it shipped to BuyerCo at a price of $8 each. BuyerCo informs SellerCorp that one of the units is defective. SellerCorp will then issue a credit memo for $8.
The credit memo will result in the following entry in SellerCorp's accounting records: 1) a debit of $8 to Sales Returns and Allowances, and 2) a credit of $8 to Accounts Receivable. In other words, the credit memo reduced SellerCorp's net sales and its accounts receivable. 
When BuyerCo records the credit memo, the following will occur in its accounting records: 1) a debit of $8 to Accounts Payable, and 2) a credit of $8 to Purchases Returns and Allowances (or to Inventory).",what
What is the accounting journal entry for depreciation?,"Definition of Journal Entry for Depreciation
The journal entry for depreciation is:

Debit to the income statement account Depreciation Expense
Credit to the balance sheet account Accumulated Depreciation

The income statement account Depreciation Expense is a temporary account. Therefore, at the end of each year, its balance is closed and the account Depreciation Expense will begin the next year with a zero balance.
The account Accumulated Depreciation is a balance sheet account and therefore its balance is not closed at the end of the year. Accumulated Depreciation is a contra asset account whose credit balance will get larger every year. However, its credit balance cannot exceed the cost of the asset being depreciated.
Purpose of Journal Entry for Depreciation
The purpose of the journal entry for depreciation is to achieve the matching principle. In each accounting period, part of the cost of certain assets (equipment, building, vehicle, etc.) will be moved from the balance sheet to depreciation expense on the income statement. The goal is to match the cost of the asset to the revenues in the accounting periods in which the asset is being used.
More Information on the Depreciation Entry
It is important to understand the following:

The depreciation entry will cause a decrease in the company's net income, but the company's cash is not decreasing. (Cash was decreased when the asset was acquired.)
The depreciation entry is an estimate based on the asset's historical cost, its estimated useful life, and its estimated salvage value.
The depreciation entry is an allocation of the asset's cost, it is not an attempt to indicate the current market value of the asset.",what
What is the difference between a trial balance and a balance sheet?,"Definition of Trial Balance
A trial balance is an internal report that remains in the accounting department. The trial balance lists all of the accounts in the general ledger and their balances (or all of the accounts that have balances). However, the debit balance amounts are entered in one column and the credit balance amounts are entered in another column. Each column is then summed to prove that the total of the debit balances is equal to the total of the credit balances. (In a manual accounting system, the trial balance would draw attention to the errors occurring when transactions were journalized, posted, account balances computed, etc. With accounting software, these clerical errors are unlikely.)
Definition of Balance Sheet
A balance sheet is one of the five financial statements that are distributed outside of the accounting department and are often distributed outside of the company. The balance sheet summarizes and reports the balances from the asset, liability, and stockholders' equity accounts that are contained in the company's general ledger. The balance sheet is also referred to as the statement of financial position.",what
What is miscellaneous expense?,"Definition of Miscellaneous Expense
In accounting, miscellaneous expense may refer to a general ledger account in which small, infrequent transaction amounts are recorded. The account Miscellaneous Expenses should be used as the last resort. For example, the small bank fees would be better recorded in a separate account such as Bank Service Charges instead of recording them in Miscellaneous Expenses.
Miscellaneous expense may also be the description on a company's income statement that refers to the amount consisting of small balances contained in many general ledger expense accounts.",what
What is a nominal account in accounting?,"Definintion of Nominal Account
In accounting, nominal accounts are the general ledger accounts that are closed at the end of each accounting year.
The closing process transfers their end-of-year balances from the nominal accounts to a permanent or real general ledger account. As a result, the nominal accounts are also referred to as temporary accounts. The closing process also means that each nominal account will start the next accounting year with a zero balance.
Examples of Nominal Accounts
The nominal accounts include:

All of a company's income statement accounts, and
The owner's drawing account

The income statement accounts record and report the company's revenues, expenses, gains, and losses. When the company is a sole proprietorship, the balances in these accounts will be closed by transferring the net amount into the owner's capital account. If the business is a corporation, the balances will be transferred to the retained earnings account.
Since the owner's drawing account is not an income statement account, its balance will be closed by transferring its debit balance directly into the owner's capital account.

What is the meaning of sundry and sundry debtors?,"Definition of Sundry
Sundry can mean various, miscellaneous, or diverse.
Definition of Sundry Debtors
Sundry debtors could be referring to a company's customers who rarely make purchases on credit and the amounts are not significant.
Example of Sundry Debtors
I suspect that the term sundry was more common when bookkeeping was done manually. For instance, prior to the low cost of computers and accounting software, the bookkeeper had to add a page to the company's subsidiary ledger book for every new customer. Adding a new page for every occasional customer could result in a subsidiary ledger book that was unwieldy. Therefore, it was more practical to have one page entitled sundry  on which those occasional customers' small transactions were entered.
With the efficiency and low cost of today's accounting systems, the need for classifying customers and accounts as sundry has been eliminated.",what
Where does revenue received in advance go on a balance sheet?,"Definition of Revenue Received in Advance
Under the accrual basis of accounting, revenues received in advance of being earned are reported as a liability. If they will be earned within one year, they should be listed as a current liability.
When a company receives money in advance of earning it, the accounting entry is a debit to the asset Cash for the amount received and a credit to the liability account such as Customer Advances or Unearned Revenues.
As the amount received in advance is earned, the liability account should be debited for the amount earned and a revenue account should be credited. This is done through an adjusting entry.
Examples of Revenue Received in Advance
The following are a few examples of revenue received in advance:

An insurance company receiving premiums for protection during the following six months
A magazine publisher receiving money from a subscriber for magazines for the following year
A website design company receiving a client's down payment for future work
A law firm receiving a retainer fee from a new client",what
What is deferred revenue?,"Deferred Revenue
Deferred revenue is money received by a company in advance of having earned it. In other words, deferred revenues are not yet revenues and therefore cannot yet be reported on the income statement. As a result, the unearned amount must be deferred to the company's balance sheet where it will be reported as a liability.
The title of the general ledger liability account may have the title of Unearned Revenues, Deferred Revenues, or Customer Deposits. As the deferred amount is earned, it should be moved from Unearned Revenues to an income statement revenue account (such as Sales Revenues, Service Revenues, Fees Earned, etc).
Example of Deferred Revenue
To illustrate deferred revenue, let's assume that a company designs websites and has been asked to provide a price quote for a new website. The design company states that it can complete the new website for $70,000. The terms require a payment of $30,000 at the time the contract is signed and $40,000 at the end of the project, which is estimated to take 60 days. The company agrees to begin working on the project 10 days after the $30,000 is received.
Now let's assume that on December 27, the design company receives the $30,000 and it will begin the project on January 4. Therefore, on December 27, the design company will record a debit of $30,000 to Cash and a credit of $30,000 to Deferred Revenues. On December 31, its balance sheet will report a current liability of $30,000 with the description Deferred revenues.
As of January 31 the company has completed 2/7 of the work. Therefore, it will record an adjusting entry dated January 31 that will debit Deferred Revenues for $20,000 and will credit the income statement account Design Revenues for $20,000. Thus, the January 31 balance sheet will report Deferred revenues of $10,000 (the company's remaining obligation/liability from the $30,000 it received on December 27).",what
Why is Accumulated Depreciation an asset account?,"Definition of Accumulated Depreciation
The account Accumulated Depreciation reports the total amount of depreciation expense that has been recorded from the time the asset was put into service until the date of the balance sheet. By crediting Accumulated Depreciation (instead of crediting the asset account which has the asset's original cost), it allows for the balance sheet to report or disclose the following:

The original cost of the asset being depreciated
The amount of depreciation expense reported so far (the balance in Accumulated Depreciation)
The amount that has not yet been depreciated (the book value of the asset)

Example of Accumulated Depreciation
Let's assume that at the beginning of the current year a company's asset account Equipment reported a cost of $70,000. From the time the equipment was put into service until the beginning of the year the related Accumulated Depreciation account shows a credit balance of $45,000. During the current year the company debits Depreciation Expense for $10,000 and credits Accumulated Depreciation for $10,000. Therefore, at the end of the current year the credit balance in Accumulated Depreciation is $55,000.
By crediting the account Accumulated Depreciation instead of crediting the Equipment account, the balance sheet at the end of the year can easily report both the equipment's cost of $70,000 and its accumulated depreciation of $55,000, the net of which is $15,000. This is more informative than reporting only the net amount of $15,000 (which would likely be the case if the contra asset account Accumulated Depreciation was not used).",what
When do you put parentheses ( ) around a number?,"Definition of Amounts in Parentheses
Parentheses around a number could have a variety of meanings. For example, parentheses could indicate any of the following:

A negative amount, such as a negative balance in your check register
A credit balance in an account that normally has a debit balance, or a debit balance in an account that normally has a credit balance
A credit entry, when a debit entry will not have parentheses
An unfavorable variance in standard costing, as opposed to a favorable variance which will not have parentheses
An unfavorable budget variance (e.g. an actual expense is more than the budgeted amount, or actual revenues are less than the budgeted amount)
An amount that is being subtracted
The meaning of a negative amount in a series of amounts, such as the bottom line of a comparative income statement that states ""Net income (loss)""",what
What are net assets?,"Definition of Net Assets
Net assets is defined as total assets  minus total liabilities.
Examples of Net Assets
In a sole proprietorship the amount of net assets is reported as owner's equity.
In a corporation the amount of net assets is reported as stockholders' equity.
In a not-for-profit (NFP) organization, the net amount of its total assets minus total liabilities is actually reported as net assets in its statement of financial position.
The net assets section for the NFP organization is divided into two major classifications:

net assets without donor restrictions
net assets with donor restrictions",what
What is a creditor?,"Definition of Creditor
A creditor could be a bank, supplier or person that has provided money, goods, or services to a company and expects to be paid at a later date. In other words, the company owes money to its creditors and the amounts should be reported on the company's balance sheet as either a current liability or a non-current (or long-term) liability.
Examples of Creditors
Some creditors, such as banks and other lenders, have lent money to the company and will require the company to sign a written promissory note for the amount owed. When a promissory note is required, the company borrowing the money will record and report the amount owed as Notes Payable.
If the creditor is a vendor or supplier that did not require the company to sign a promissory note, the amount owed is likely to to be reported as Accounts Payable or Accrued Liabilities.
Other creditors include the company's employees (who are owed wages and bonuses), governments (who are owed taxes), and customers (who made deposits or other prepayments).
Some creditors are referred to as secured creditors because they have a registered lien on some of the company's assets. A creditor without a lien (or other legal claim) on the company's assets is an unsecured creditor.",what
What are adjusting entries?,"Definition of Adjusting Entries
Adjusting entries are usually made on the last day of an accounting period (year, quarter, month) so that a company's financial statements comply with the accrual method of accounting. In other words, the adjusting entries are needed so that a company's:

Income statement reports the revenues that have been earned during the accounting period
Balance sheet reports the receivables that it has a right to receive as of the end of the accounting period
Income statement reports the expenses  and losses that were incurred during the accounting period
Balance sheet reports the liabilities it has incurred as of the end of the accounting period

Examples of Adjusting Entries
Here are a few examples of the need for adjusting entries:

A company shipped goods on credit, but the company's sales invoice was not processed as of the end of the accounting period
A company received some goods from a vendor but the vendor's invoice had not been processed by the company as of the end of the accounting period
A company that prepares monthly income statements paid for 6 months of insurance coverage in the first month of the insurance coverage. (This means that 5/6 of the payment is a prepaid asset and only 1/6 of the payment should be reported as an expense on each of the monthly income statements.)
A company's customer paid in advance for services to be provided over several accounting periods. Until the services are provided, the unearned amount is reported as a liability. After the services are provided, an entry is needed to reduce the liability and to report the revenues.

Note that a common characteristic of every adjusting entry will involve at least one income statement account and at least one balance sheet account.",what
What are reversing entries and why are they used?,"Definition of Reversing Entries
Reversing entries are made on the first day of an accounting period to remove accrual adjusting entries that were made at the end of the previous accounting period. Two benefits of using reversing entries are:

It greatly reduces the chance of double-counting revenues and/or expenses, and
It allows for more efficient processing of the actual invoices that will be processed in the new
accounting period

Example of Reversing Entries
To illustrate reversing entries, let's assume that a retailer uses a temporary employment agency service to provide workers from December 15 to December 29. The temp agency will bill the retailer on January 6 and the retailer is required to pay the invoice by January 10. Assuming the retailer's accounting year ends on December 31, the retailer will make an accrual adjusting entry on December 31 for the estimated amount. If the estimated amount is $18,000 the retailer will debit Temp Service Expense for $18,000 and will credit Accrued Expenses Payable for $18,000. This adjusting entry assures that the retailer's income statement for the period ended December 31 will report the $18,000 expense and its balance sheet as of December 31 will report the $18,000 liability.
After the financial statements are prepared, the closing entries will transfer the balance in the account Temp Service Expense to an owner's/stockholders' equity account. As a result, the account Temp Service Expense will begin January with a zero balance. 
When a reversing entry is recorded as of January 1, it simply removes the estimated amounts contained in the December 31 accrual adjusting entry. In other words, the January 1 reversing entry will:

Debit Accrued Expenses Payable for $18,000, and
Credit Temp Service Expense for $18,000

After the January 1 reversing entry, the account Accrued Expenses Payable will have a zero balance, and the account Temp Service Expense will have an unusual credit balance of $18,000.
When the temp agency's invoice dated January 6 arrives, the retailer can simply debit the invoice amount to Temp Service Expense and credit Accounts Payable (the normal routine procedure). If the actual invoice is $18,000 the balance in Temp Service Expense will change from a credit balance of $18,000 to a balance of $0. (Zero is the correct expense for the new accounting period, since the $18,000 had been reported as an expense in the previous accounting period.) Thanks to the reversing entry, the person paying the retailer's bills can do what is done for any other vendor invoice.
If the invoice amount on January 6 had been $18,250 the entire amount would be debited to Temp Service Expense and credited to Accounts Payable. The resulting debit balance of $250 in Temp Service Expense will be reported as a January expense. Since the $250 is insignificant difference from an estimated amount, it is acceptable to report the $250 as a January expense instead of a December expense.",what
What is a source document?,"Definition of Source Document
A source document is an original record which contains the detail that supports or substantiates a transaction that will be (or has been) entered in an accounting system. In the past, source documents were printed on paper. Today, the source documents may be an electronic record.
Examples of Source Documents
A few examples of a company's source documents include:

Employees' time cards that support the company's weekly payroll
Vendors' invoices for company's payments for merchandise or services it purchased
A company's receiving reports that support the vendors' invoices",what
How do you record a payment for insurance?,"Definition of Payment for Insurance
A company's property insurance, liability insurance, business interruption insurance, etc. often covers a one-year period with the cost (insurance premiums) paid in advance. The one-year period for the insurance rarely coincides with the company's accounting year. Therefore, the insurance payments will likely involve more than one annual financial statement and many interim financial statements. 
Prepaid Insurance vs. Insurance Expense
When the insurance premiums are paid in advance, they are referred to as prepaid. At the end of any accounting period, the amount of the insurance premiums that remain prepaid should be reported in the current asset account, Prepaid Insurance. The prepaid amount will be reported on the balance sheet after inventory and could part of an item described as prepaid expenses.
As the prepaid amount expires, the balance in Prepaid Insurance is reduced by a credit to Prepaid Insurance and a debit to Insurance Expense. This is done with an adjusting entry at the end of each accounting period (e.g. monthly). One objective of the adjusting entry is to match the proper amount of insurance expense to the period indicated on the income statement.
Example of Payment for Insurance Expense
Let's assume that a company is started on December 1 and arranges for business insurance to begin on December 1. On December 1 the company pays the insurance company $12,000 for the insurance premiums covering one year. The company will record the payment with a debit of $12,000 to Prepaid Insurance and a credit of $12,000 to Cash.
On December 31, the company writes an adjusting entry to record the insurance expense that was used up (expired) and to reduce the amount that remains prepaid. This is accomplished with a debit of $1,000 to Insurance Expense and a credit of $1,000 to Prepaid Insurance. This same adjusting entry will be prepared at the end of each of the next 11 months.",what
How do I record a loan payment which includes paying both interest and principal?,"Definition of a Loan Payment
A loan payment is likely to consist of three amounts:

Total payment amount
Interest payment
Principal payment

Generally, the interest payment is related to the principal amount that is owed to the lender. Whenever a principal payment occurs, the balance of the principal amount owed will decrease. Therefore, the next interest payment will be smaller than the previous interest payment.
Example of Loan Payment
Let's assume that a company has a loan payment of $2,000 consisting of an interest payment of $500 and a principal payment of $1,500.
The company's entry to record the loan payment will be:

Debit of $500 to Interest Expense
Debit of $1,500 to Loans Payable
Credit of $2,000 to Cash

The credit balance in the company's liability account Loans Payable should agree with the principal balance in the lender's records. This can be confirmed on a loan statement from the lender or by asking the lender for the principal balance.",what
What are assets?,"Definition of Assets
In accounting and bookkeeping, a company's assets can be defined as:

Resources or things of value that are owned by a company as the result of company transactions
Prepaid expenses that have not yet been used up or have not yet expired
Costs that have a future value that can be measured

Assets are recorded at their cost and (except for some securities) are not adjusted for changes in market value. Long-term assets such as buildings and equipment are depreciated and therefore will be reported at less than their cost.
Assets are part of the accounting equation and the balance sheet, both of which are presented in this format:
Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders' (or Owner's) Equity.
Some of the company's most valuable assets may not have been acquired in a transaction and therefore are not listed as assets on the company's balance sheet. Examples include a highly-respected trade name, a valuable patent, a very effective management team and company culture.
Example of Assets
Examples of assets that are likely to be listed on a company's balance sheet include: cash, temporary investments, accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid expenses, long-term investments, land, buildings, machines, equipment, furniture, fixtures, vehicles, goodwill, and more.",what
How are the balance sheet and income statement connected?,"Connection between Balance Sheet and Income Statement
The connection between the balance sheet and the income statement results from:

The use of double-entry accounting or bookkeeping, and
 The accounting equation Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity

Basically, the income statement components have the following effects on owner's equity:

Revenues and gains cause owner's (or stockholders') equity to increase
Expenses and losses cause owner's (or stockholders') equity to decrease

Example of How the Balance Sheet and Income Statement Are Connected
To illustrate the connection between the balance sheet and income statement, let's assume that a company's owner's equity was $40,000 at the beginning of the year, and it was $65,000 at the end of the year. Let's also assume that the owner did not invest or withdraw business assets during the year. Therefore, the $25,000 increase in owner's equity is likely the company's net income earned for the year. The details for the $25,000 (revenues, expenses, gains, losses) will be reported on the company's income statement for the year.
Accountants refer to the income statement accounts (revenues, expenses, gains, losses) as temporary accounts because their balances will be closed and transferred to the owner's capital account at the end of the year.",what
What is an account?,"Definitions of Account
In accounting, an account is a record in the general ledger that is used to sort and store transactions. For example, companies will have a Cash account in which to record every transaction that increases or decreases the company's cash. Another account, Sales, will collect all of the amounts from the sale of merchandise. Most accounting systems require that every transaction will affect two or more accounts. For example, a cash sale will increase the Cash account and will increase the Sales account.
The term account is also used in transactions where suppliers sell goods to customers and grant credit terms such as net 10 days. In those situations, a supplier is selling goods on account and the customer has purchased goods on account. The supplier has also increased the balance in its current asset account entitled Accounts Receivable and the customer will increase the balance in its current liability account entitled Accounts Payable.",what
Which accounts normally have debit balances?,"Assets, expenses, losses, and the owner's drawing account will normally have debit balances. Their balances will increase with a debit entry, and will decrease with a credit entry.
Liabilities, revenues and sales, gains, and owner equity and stockholders' equity accounts normally have credit balances. These accounts will see their balances increase when the account is credited. Their balances will decrease when they debited.
For example, if a company borrows cash from its local bank, the company will debit its asset account Cash since the company's cash balance is increasing. The same entry will include a credit to its liability account Notes Payable since that account balance is also increasing.",what
What is the accounting cycle?,"Definition of Accounting Cycle
The accounting cycle is often described as a process that includes the following steps:

Identifying, collecting and analyzing documents and transactions
Recording the transactions in journals
Posting the journalized amounts to accounts in the general and subsidiary ledgers
Preparing an unadjusted trial balance and perhaps preparing a worksheet
Determining and recording adjusting entries
Preparing an adjusted trial balance
Preparing the financial statements
Recording and posting closing entries
Preparing a post-closing trial balance
Recording reversing entries

Accounting Cycle Today
The above steps were clear in a manual accounting system. However, today these steps are occurring with electronic speed and accuracy within sophisticated yet inexpensive accounting software. The accountant can enter adjusting entries into the software and can instantaneously obtain a complete set of financial statements by simply selecting them from a menu. After reviewing the financial statements, the accountant is able to make additional adjustments and almost immediately obtain the revised reports. The software will also prepare, record, and post the closing entries. It will also reverse adjusting entries that have been designated to be reversed.",what
What is bad debts expense?,"Definition of Bad Debts Expense
Bad debts expense is related to a company's current asset accounts receivable. Bad debts expense is also referred to as uncollectible accounts expense or doubtful accounts expense. Bad debts expense results because a company delivered goods or services on credit and the customer did not pay the amount owed.
Examples of Bad Debts Expense
There are two methods for reporting the amount of bad debts expense:

direct write-off method
allowance method

The direct write-off method requires that a customer's uncollectible account be removed from Accounts Receivable and at that time the following entry is made: debit Bad Debts Expense and credit Accounts Receivable.
The allowance method  anticipates and estimates that some of the accounts receivable will not be collected. In other words, prior to knowing exactly which customers or clients will not be paying, the company will debit Bad Debts Expense and will credit Allowance for Doubtful Accounts for the estimated amount. (The Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is a contra asset account that when presented along with Accounts Receivable indicates a more realistic amount that will be turning to cash.)
For financial statement purposes the allowance method is the better method since 1) the balance sheet will be reporting a more realistic amount that will be collected from the company's accounts receivable, and 2) the bad debts expense will be reported on the income statement closer to the time of the related credit sales. However, for income tax purposes the direct write-off method must be used.",what
Is Accounts Payable a debit or a credit or both?,"Definition of an Accounts Payable Credit
Since Accounts Payable is a liability account, it should have a credit balance. The credit balance indicates the amount that a company or organization owes to its suppliers or vendors.
If a company purchases additional goods or services on credit (as opposed to paying with cash), the company will need to credit Accounts Payable so that the credit balance will increase accordingly.
Definition of an Accounts Payable Debit
If a company pays one of its suppliers the amount that is included in Accounts Payable, the company will need to debit Accounts Payable so that the credit balance is decreased.",what
How do I record an advance to an employee and the deduction?,"Definition of Advance to an Employee
A cash advance to an employee is usually a temporary loan by a company to an employee. In other words, the company is the lender and the employee is the borrower.
The cash advance needs to be reported as a reduction in the company's Cash account and an increase in an asset account such as Advance to Employees or Other Receivables: Advances. (If the amount is expected to be repaid within one year, this account will be reported as a current asset.)
If the cash advance is repaid through payroll withholdings, the amount withheld will be recorded as a credit to Advance to Employees.
Example of Advance to an Employee
Let's assume that a valuable employee's car requires an emergency repair of $800. The employee is unable to pay for the repair and has no other means for getting to work. The company agrees to lend the employee $800 and to withhold $100 per week from the employee's weekly payroll checks until the $800 is repaid.
The company will debit the current asset Advance to Employees for $800 and will credit Cash for $800. The weekly payroll processing will result in a credit of $100 to Advance to Employees (thereby reducing the amount that is credited to Cash).",what
Are transportation-in costs part of the cost of goods sold?,"Definition of Transportation-in Costs
Transportation-in costs, which are also known as freight-in costs, are part of the cost of goods purchased. The reason is that accountants define ""cost"" as all costs necessary to get an asset in place and ready for use.
If a company purchases goods with terms such as FOB shipping point, the company will be responsible for any costs to get the products from the seller to the company's warehouse. In that situation, the company using the periodic system will likely have a purchases account entitled Transportation-in or Freight-in. (If goods are purchased with terms of FOB destination, the buyer will not have a separate transportation-in cost, because the seller is responsible for the costs of getting the goods to the buyer's location.) 
Transportation-in costs should be allocated or assigned to the products purchased. Therefore, the unsold products in inventory should include a portion of the transportation-in costs. The products that have been sold, should have their share of the transportation-in costs in the cost of goods sold).
Example of Transportation-in Costs
Let's assume that a bookstore purchases 20 copies of a bestselling book for $20 each and the terms are FOB shipping point. The shipping cost to get the books from the publisher to the bookstore amounts to $40. Therefore, this transportation-in cost of $40 amounts to $2 per book, resulting in a cost per book of $22. If 16 books are sold, the cost of goods sold will be $352 (16 X $22) and the inventory cost of the remaining 4 books will be $88 (4 X $22). In total, the bookstore had purchases of $400 + transportation-in cost of $40, resulting in the cost of goods available of $440. When we subtract the $88 cost of inventory, there is $352 as the cost of goods sold.",what
What is a contra account?,"Definition of Contra Account
A contra account is a general ledger account with a balance that is opposite of the normal balance for that account classification. The use of a contra account allows a company to report the original amount and also report a reduction so that the net amount will also be reported. The net amount is often referred to as the carrying amount or perhaps the net realizable amount.
Examples of Contra Accounts
To illustrate, let's use the contra asset account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. Since it is a contra asset account, this allowance account must have a credit balance (which is contrary to the debit balances found in asset accounts). The Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is directly related to the asset account entitled Accounts Receivable. Therefore, if the Accounts Receivable has a debit balance of $40,000 and the allowance account has a credit balance of $2,000, the readers of the balance sheet will see that customers owe $40,000 for past purchases but the company does not expect to collect $2,000 of the $40,000. Therefore, the net amount of the accounts receivable that is expected to turn to cash is $38,000.
A second example of a contra asset account is Accumulated Depreciation. For instance, if a company has a plant asset such as Equipment with a debit balance of $92,000 and the account Accumulated Depreciation has a credit balance of $50,000, the carrying amount (or book value) of the equipment is $42,000.
The income statement account Sales Returns and Allowances is a contra revenue account that is associated with the revenue account Sales. If the balance in this contra account is a debit of $3,000 and the Sales account has the expected credit balance of $400,000, the company's net sales are $397,000. This use of Sales Returns and Allowances (instead of debiting Sales) enables management to see that its customers had a problem with $3,000 of the company's goods.",what
What is the difference between an invoice and a voucher?,"Definition of an Invoice
An invoice received from a vendor is a billing for goods or services that it had provided. The vendor's invoice will include the quantities of the items provided, brief descriptions, unit prices, amount due, credit terms, where to remit payment, etc.
Definition of a Voucher
A voucher is an internal document used by a company's accounts payable department in order to collect and organize the necessary documentation and approvals before paying a vendor's invoice. The voucher acts as a cover page to which the following will be attached: vendor's invoice, company's purchase order, company's receiving report, and other information needed to further process the vendor's invoice for payment.",what
What should be the entry when goods are purchased at a discount?,"Definition of Goods Purchased at a Discount
There are two common types of discounts for companies buying goods to resell:

Trade discount
Early payment discount

Examples of Entries for Goods Purchased at a Discount
Trade discount. Some suppliers have catalogs with prices before any discounts. Let's assume that the supplier gives companies that purchase a high volume of goods a trade discount of 30%. A small volume buyer receives only a 10% discount. If a high volume company purchases $40,000 of goods, its cost will be $28,000 ($40,000 X 70%). To comply with the cost principle the company will debit Purchases (or Inventory) for $28,000 and will credit Accounts Payable for $28,000.
Early payment discount. Some suppliers offer discounts of 1% or 2% from the sales invoice amount, if the invoice is paid in 10 days instead of the usual 30 days. For instance, let's assume that a company purchases goods and the supplier's sales invoice is $28,000 with terms of 1/10, net 30. This means that the company can deduct $280 (1% of $28,000) if it pays the invoice within 10 days. Otherwise, the company must pay $28,000 within 30 days. The early payment discount is also referred to as a purchase discount or cash discount.
If the company pays the supplier's invoice within 10 days, there are two ways to record the early payment discount of $280:

Gross method. At the time goods are received: debit of $28,000 to Purchases, credit of $28,000 to Accounts Payable. At the payment date within 10 days: debit of $28,000 to Accounts Payable, credit of $27,720 to Cash, credit of $280 to Purchases Discounts (a contra account to Purchases)
Net method. (This method is used less often and only if the company has the resources to always pay within the discount period.) At the time the goods are received: debit of $27,720 to Purchases, credit of $27,720 to Accounts Payable. At the payment date within 10 days: debit $27,720 to Accounts Payable, credit $27,720 to Cash. [If the company fails to pay the invoice within the discount period, the payment will be a debit of $27,720 to Accounts Payable, a debit of $280 to Purchase Discounts, a credit to Cash for $28,000. Purchase Discounts Lost is an income statement account.]",what
What is an imprest system of petty cash?,"Definition of Petty Cash
Petty cash refers to a small amount of currency and coins that a company uses to pay small amounts without writing a check. The amount of petty cash (also known as the petty cash fund) varies by company or organization. For now, let's assume that the amount is $100.
One person is designated as the petty cash custodian. This person is responsible for disbursing the small amounts
and for documenting each payment with a petty cash receipt.
Definition of an Imprest System of Petty Cash
An imprest system of petty cash means that the general ledger account Petty Cash will remain dormant at a constant amount. If the amount of petty cash is $100, then the Petty Cash account will always report a debit balance of $100. This $100 is the imprest balance. As long as $100 is adequate for the organization's small disbursements, then the general ledger account Petty Cash will never be debited or credited again.
When the currency and coins on hand gets low, the petty cash custodian will request a check to replenish the coins and currency that were disbursed. Since the requested check is drawn on the organization's checking account, the Cash account (not the Petty Cash account) will be credited. The debits will go to the expense accounts indicated by the petty cash receipts, such as postage expense, supplies expense. In other words, the general ledger account Petty Cash is not involved in the replenishment. (Replenishment means getting the total of the currency and coins back to the imprest amount.) The petty cash custodian will cash the check and add the amount to the other cash. 
Under the imprest system, the petty cash custodian should at all times have a combination of currency, coins, and petty cash receipts that equals $100 (the imprest petty cash balance).
Control over the petty cash occurs during the replenishment process. The person approving the check for the petty cash custodian to cash should review the petty cash receipts and attach them to the check request. Control can also occur when an independent person confirms that the petty cash custodian's cash and receipts adds up to the imprest amount.",what
What is the difference between a nominal account and a real account?,"Definition of Nominal Account
The balance in a nominal account is closed at the end of the accounting year. As a result, a nominal account begins each accounting year with a zero balance. Since the balance does not carry forward to the next accounting year, a nominal account is also referred to as a temporary account.
Examples of Nominal Accounts
The nominal accounts are almost always the income statement accounts such as the accounts for recording revenues, expenses, gains, and losses. When the income statement accounts are closed at the end of the accounting year, the net amount will ultimately end up in a balance sheet equity account such as the proprietor's capital account or the corporation's retained earnings account.
Definition of Real Account
The balance in a real account is not closed at the end of the accounting year. As a result, a real account begins each accounting year with its balance from the end of the previous year. Because the end-of-the-year balance is carried forward to the next accounting year, a real account is also known as a permanent account.
Examples of Real Accounts
The real accounts are the balance sheet accounts such as the accounts for recording assets, liabilities, and the owner's (or stockholders') equity. However, the sole proprietor's drawing account, which is reported on the balance sheet during the year, is a temporary account because it is closed directly to the owner's capital account at the end of the year.",what
What are balance sheet accounts?,"Definition of Balance Sheet Accounts
Balance sheet accounts are one of two types of general ledger accounts. (The other accounts in the general ledger are the income statement accounts.) 
Balance sheet accounts are used to sort and store transactions involving a company's assets, liabilities, and owner's or stockholders' equity. The balances in these accounts as of the final moment of an accounting year will be reported on the company's end-of-year balance sheet.
Balance sheet accounts are also referred to as permanent or real accounts because at the end of the accounting year the balances in these accounts are not closed. Instead, the ending balances will be carried forward to become the beginning balances in the next accounting year. (This is different from the income statement accounts which are closed at the end of each accounting year and will begin the following year with zero balances.)
Examples of Balance Sheet Accounts
Examples of a corporation's balance sheet accounts include Cash, Temporary Investments, Accounts Receivable, Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, Inventory, Investments, Land, Buildings, Equipment, Furniture and Fixtures, Accumulated Depreciation, Notes Payable, Accounts Payable, Payroll Taxes Payable, Paid-in Capital, Retained Earnings, and others.",what
What is the meaning of debtor?,"Definition of Debtor
A debtor is a person, company, or other entity that owes money. In other words, the debtor has a debt or legal obligation to pay the amount owed. 
Example of Debtor
If a company borrows $10,000 from a bank, the company is the debtor and the bank is the creditor.",what
"What is the difference between revenue, income, and gain?","Definition of Revenue
Revenue is the amount earned from a company's main operating activities, such as a retailer selling merchandise or a law firm providing legal services.
Definition of Gain
In accounting, a gain is the result of a peripheral activity, such as a retailer selling one of its old delivery trucks. A gain occurs when the cash amount (or its equivalent) received is greater than the asset's carrying amount, which is also referred to as the asset's book value. For example, if the company receives $3,000 for the old delivery truck, and the truck's carry amount (book value) at the time of the sale was $600, the company will have a gain of $2,400.
Definition of Income
Non-accountants might use the term income instead of the word revenue. Generally, accountants use the term income to mean ""net of revenues and expenses."" For example, a retailer's income from operations is its net sales minus the cost of goods sold minus its selling, general and administrative expenses.",what
Is a loan's principal payment included on the income statement?,"Definition of Loan Principal Payment
When a company borrows money from its bank, the amount received is recorded with a debit to Cash and a credit to a liability account, such as Notes Payable or Loans Payable, which is reported on the company's balance sheet. The cash received from the bank loan is referred to as the principal amount.
The principal amount received from the bank is not part of a company's revenues and therefore will not be reported on the company's income statement. Similarly, any repayment of the principal amount will not be an expense and therefore will not be reported on the income statement. The principal payment is recorded as a reduction of the liability Notes Payable or Loans Payable. (Both the receipt of the loan principal amount and the repayment of the loan principal will be reported on the statement of cash flows.) The interest on the loan will be reported as expense on the income statement in the periods when the interest is incurred.
Example of a Loan Principal Payment
Let's assume that a company borrows $10,000 from its bank. The company's cash increases by $10,000 and its liability Loans Payable increases by $10,000. Let's also assume that the company makes a payment of $1,000 consisting of $60 for interest and $940 for principal, the entry will be:

Debit of $60 to Interest Expense (an income statement account)
Debit of $940 to Loans Payable (a balance sheet account)
Credit of $1,000 to Cash (a balance sheet account)

Notice that only the interest expense of $60 will be included on the income statement.",what
How do you report a write-down in inventory?,"Definition of Write-down in Inventory
Under FIFO and average cost methods, when the net realizable value of inventory is less than the cost of the inventory, there needs to be a reduction in the inventory amount. Often the balance in the current asset account Inventory is reduced through a credit to a contra inventory account, which is referred to as a valuation account. The debit in the entry to write down inventory is recorded in an account such as Loss on Write-Down of Inventory, which is an income statement account.
Example of Reporting a Write-down in Inventory
Under FIFO and average cost methods, if the net realizable value is less than the inventory's cost, the balance sheet must report the lower amount. If the amount of the Loss on Write-Down of Inventory is relatively small, it can be reported on the income statement as part of the cost of goods sold. If the amount of the Loss on Write-Down of Inventory is significant, it should be reported as a separate line on the income statement.
Since the amount of the write-down of inventory reduces net income, it will also reduce the amount reported on the balance sheet for owner's equity or stockholders' equity. Thus, the balance sheet and the accounting equation will show a reduction in inventory and in owner's or stockholders' equity.",what
Why and how do you adjust the inventory account in the periodic method?,"Definition of Inventory Account in Periodic Method
Under the periodic method or periodic system, the account Inventory is dormant throughout the accounting year and will report only the cost of the prior year's ending inventory. The current year's purchases are recorded in one or more temporary accounts entitled Purchases. At the end of the accounting year, the beginning balance in the account Inventory must be changed so that it reports the cost (or perhaps lower than the cost) of the ending inventory.
Examples of Adjusting the Inventory Account
When using the periodic method, balance in the inventory account can be changed to the ending inventory's cost by recording an adjusting entry.
To illustrate, let's assume that the cost of a company's beginning inventory (last year's ending inventory) was $35,000. This balance will be the only amount in the account Inventory until the end of the year. Let's assume that at the end of the year a physical count of inventory is taken and it has an actual cost of $40,000. To adjust the Inventory account balance from a debit balance of $35,000 to a debit balance of $40,000, the following adjusting entry will be needed:

Debit Inventory for $5,000, and
Credit Inventory Change for $5,000

Let's also assume that the Purchases account showed a debit balance of $200,000 for the year.
The account Inventory Change is an income statement account that when combined with the amount in the Purchases account will result in the cost of goods sold. In our example, the $5,000 credit balance in the account Inventory Change will reduce the $200,000 of Purchases, resulting in the cost of goods sold of $195,000 ($200,000 of purchases minus the $5,000 of purchases that were not sold and caused inventory to increase). 
As an additional example, let's assume that in the following year the company's ending inventory has a cost of $29,000. However, the inventory account has the debit balance of $40,000 from the prior year. This situation will require the following adjusting entry:

Credit Inventory for $11,000, and
Debit Inventory Change for $11,000

Let's also assume that the Purchases account showed a debit balance of $230,000 for the year.
The debit balance of $11,000 in the account Inventory Change when combined with the debit balance of $230,000 in the Purchases account will result in the cost of the goods sold of $241,000 ($230,000 of purchases plus $11,000 that was sold from inventory). 
Textbooks may change the balance in the account Inventory (under the periodic method) through the closing entries. (One closing entry removes the amount of beginning inventory and one closing entry records the cost of the ending inventory.) We believe that an adjusting entry is more logical and efficient, especially when a company's monthly and year-to-date financial statements are prepared using accounting software.",what
What is an expense?,"Definition of Expense
Under the accrual method of accounting, an expense is a cost that is reported on the income statement for the period in which:

The cost best matches the related revenues
The cost is used up or expires
There is uncertainty or difficulty in measuring the future benefit of the cost

Examples of Expense
Some of the expenses that will be reported on a retailer's income statement for the month of August include:

Cost of goods sold for the August sales. (The date that the retailer had paid for the goods is not pertinent.)
Commissions earned by the sales staff for having sold the goods in August (even if the commissions are paid in September)
Cost of the electricity used in August (even if the bill is received in September and is paid in October)
August rent for the store
Wages that employees earned in August
Advertising that took place in August

Expenses are often divided into two major classifications:

Operating expenses which involve a company's main activities. A retailer's operating expenses include the cost of goods sold and its selling, general and administrative expenses. Inside the company, these will likely be sorted by department, product line, and so on.
Nonoperating expenses which pertain to a company's incidental activities. A common nonoperating expense for a retailer is interest expense.",what
What is the purpose of subsidiary ledgers?,"Definition of Subsidiary Ledger
A subsidiary ledger contains the details to support a general ledger control account. For instance, the subsidiary ledger for accounts receivable contains the information for each of the company's credit sales to customers, each customer's remittance, return of merchandise, discounts, and so on. With these details in the subsidiary ledger, the Accounts Receivable account in the general ledger can report summary amounts for the accounts receivable activity.
Examples of Subsidiary Ledgers
By having the details of the accounts receivable activity in a subsidiary ledger, employees in a company's credit department of a company can access the credit sales information without having access to any information in the general ledger.
In job order costing systems, the job cost sheets (or job cost records) will serve as the subsidiary ledger containing the details for the general ledger account Work in Process. The Work in Process account will now be a control account containing summary amounts for direct materials, direct labor, factory overhead applied, transfers to finished goods, etc. Manufacturing personnel will have full access to the job cost sheets without having access to other information in the general ledger.
Since companies are integrating accounting records with their other information into one database, I assume there will be less use of the term subsidiary ledgers in the future. There will likely be reports generated to provide the information formerly contained in the subsidiary ledger.",what
What is the difference between a cost and an expense?,"Definitions of Cost and Expense
Some people use cost interchangeably with expense. However, we use the term cost to mean the amount spent to purchase an item, a service, etc. Some costs are not expenses (cost of land), some costs will become expenses (cost of a new delivery van), and some costs become expenses immediately (airing a televison advertisement). 
Examples of Costs and Expenses
Assume that a company purchases 2,000 units of a supply item each of which has a cost of $5. If none of the units have been used, the current asset supplies will be reported at the cost of $10,000 (2,000 units at $5 each). At the time of the next balance sheet, only 500 of the units are on hand and 1,500 units have been used in the business. As a result, the balance sheet will report the supplies on hand at their cost of $2,500 (500 units at $5) and the income statement will report supplies expense of $7,500 (1,500 units at $5). 
Assume that a company purchases a delivery truck to be used in its business. Initially the truck's cost will be recorded in the asset account Delivery Truck. However, the truck's cost will become Depreciation Expense as the truck is ""used up"" in the company's revenue-generating activities.",what
"What is reported as property, plant and equipment?","Definition of Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment is the long-term asset or noncurrent asset section of the balance sheet that reports the tangible, long-lived assets that are used in the company's operations. These assets are commonly referred to as the company's fixed assets or plant assets.
Generally, the property, plant and equipment assets are reported at their cost followed by a deduction for the accumulated depreciation that applies to all of these assets except land (which is not depreciated).
Examples of Property, Plant and Equipment
Typical assets that are included in property, plant and equipment are land, buildings, machinery, equipment, vehicles, furniture, fixtures, office equipment, etc. which are used in the business. Also included in this balance sheet classification is a subtraction of the accumulated depreciation that pertains to these assets.",what
Why are expenses debited?,"Why Expenses Are Debited
Expenses cause owner's equity to decrease. Since owner's equity's normal balance is a credit balance, an expense must be recorded as a debit. At the end of the accounting year the debit balances in the expense accounts will be closed and transferred to the owner's capital account, thereby reducing owner's equity. (At a corporation, the debit balances in the expense accounts will be closed and transferred to Retained Earnings, which is a stockholders' equity account.)
Example of Why Expenses Are Debited
To illustrate why expenses are debited, let's assume that a new company has only one asset, Cash of $10,000, and its owner's equity is $10,000. The company then pays $500 for advertising that occurs at the time of payment. The company must reduce its Cash (which has a debit balance of $10,000) by entering a credit of $500. To comply with double-entry accounting, the company must record a debit of $500, which will be entered in Advertising Expense. Let's also assume this was the only transaction for the year. As a result, the company's balance sheet will report assets of $9,500 and owner's equity of $9,500. As you can see, there are two reasons why Advertising Expense had to be debited:

The transaction required a credit to Cash since this asset account is being reduced. Therefore, there must also be a debit recorded in another account, namely Advertising Expense.
The owner's equity and liabilities will normally have credit balances. Since expenses reduce owner's equity, Advertising Expense must be debited for $500. Therefore, double entry requires that another account must be credited for $500. Since cash was used, the account Cash will be credited. This is logical since this asset's normal debit balance must be reduced.",what
What is the monthly close?,"Definition of Monthly Close
In accounting, monthly close is a series of steps and procedures that are followed so that a company's monthly financial statements are in compliance with the accrual method of accounting.
Since a company's business activities are ongoing, accountants might state ""we need to get a proper ""cut-off"" between the end-of-the-month transactions and those that belong in the following month.
If a company sells goods and has inventories, its monthly close will be more challenging. The company must be certain that the costs of the goods purchased are recorded in the same month as the goods are added to the inventories.
Reviewing the financial statements before they are distributed is also an important step in the monthly close. This could mean comparing the amounts and percentages on the current financial statements to those of earlier months. For example, if the current income statement shows the cost of goods sold as 86% instead of the normal 81%, the current month's amounts should be investigated before releasing the financial statements.",what
What is the difference between accounts payable and accrued expenses payable?,"Definition of Accounts Payable
Accounts Payable is a liability account in which suppliers' or vendors' approved invoices are recorded. As a result, the balance in Accounts Payable should be a precise amount.
Definition of Accrued Expenses Payable
Accrued Expenses Payable is a liability account that records amounts that are owed, but the vendors' invoices have not yet been received and/or have not yet been recorded in Accounts Payable as of the end of the accounting period. The amounts in this account are usually recorded with accrual adjusting entries made at the end of the accounting period.
Examples of Accrued Expenses Payable
In addition to the amounts associated with vendors' invoices, accrued expenses may also include wages, interest, utilities, and other expenses that were incurred and owed, but not yet recorded in the general ledger accounts. Some of the amounts recorded in Accrued Expenses Payable may be estimated amounts that should supported by reasonable and documented calculations.

What are some reasons that cause the balance on the bank statement to differ from the cash balance on the books?,"Reasons a Bank Balance Will Differ from a Company's Balance
Some of the reasons for a difference between the balance on the bank statement and the balance on the books include:

Outstanding checks
Deposits in transit
Bank service charges and check printing charges
Errors on the company's books
Electronic charges and deposits that appear on the bank statement but are not yet recorded in the company's records

How to Document the Differences
Any items that are already recorded in the company's general ledger accounts, but have not yet appeared on the bank statement (outstanding checks, deposits in transit), will be noted as an adjustment to the balance per bank statement. Outstanding checks are a deduction to the balance per bank; deposits in transit are an addition to the balance per bank.
If an item is on the bank statement but has not yet been entered on the books, the items are noted as an adjustment to the balance per books. Bank service charges, check printing charges, and other electronic deductions that are not yet recorded in the company's accounts will become deductions from the cash balance per the books. Electronic deposits not yet recorded by the company will become additions to the cash balance per books.",what
What is the difference between periodic and perpetual inventory systems?,"Periodic Inventory System
In a periodic system the account Inventory:

Has only the ending balance from the previous accounting year
Excludes the cost of purchases, purchases returns and allowances, etc. since these are recorded in accounts such as Purchases, Purchases Returns and Allowances, Purchases Discounts, etc.
Must be adjusted at the end of the accounting year in order to report the costs actually in inventory
Requires a physical inventory at least once per year and estimates within the year
Requires a cost flow assumption (FIFO, LIFO, average)

The periodic inventory system requires a calculation to determine the cost of goods sold.
Perpetual Inventory System
In a perpetual system the account Inventory:

Is debited whenever there is a purchase of goods (there is no Purchases account)
Is credited for the cost of the items sold (and the account Cost of Goods Sold is debited
Has a continuously or perpetually changing balance because of the above entries
Requires a physical inventory to correct any errors in the Inventory account
Requires a cost flow assumption (FIFO, LIFO, average)

With the perpetual inventory system, the cost of goods sold is readily available in the account Cost of Goods Sold.
[It is possible that a company uses the periodic system in its general ledger, but uses a different computer system outside of its general ledger to track the flow of goods in and out of inventory.]",what
What is materiality?,"Definition of Materiality
In accounting, materiality refers to the relative size of an amount. Relatively large amounts are material, while relatively small amounts are not material (or immaterial). Determining materiality requires professional judgement. For instance, a $20,000 amount will likely be immaterial for a large corporation with a net income of $900,000. However, the same $20,000 amount will be material for a small corporation with a net income of $40,000.
Another view of materiality is whether sophisticated investors would be misled if the amount was omitted or misclassified. If sophisticated investors would be misled or would have made a different decision, the amount is considered to be material. If sophisticated investors would not be misled or would not have made a different decision, the amount is judged to be immaterial. 
Example of Materiality
A classic example of the materiality concept is a company expensing a $20 wastebasket in the year it is acquired instead of depreciating it over its useful life of 10 years. The matching principle directs you to record the wastebasket as an asset and then report depreciation expense of $2 a year for 10 years. Materiality allows you to expense the entire $20 cost in the year it is acquired. The reason is that no investor, creditor, or other interested party would be misled by immediately expensing the $20 wastebasket.
Materiality also justifies large corporations having a policy of immediately expensing assets having a cost of less than $2,500 instead of setting up fixed asset records and depreciating those assets over their useful lives.",what
What is bookkeeping?,"Definition of Bookkeeping
Bookkeeping includes the recording, storing and retrieving of financial transactions for a business, nonprofit organization, individual, etc.
Examples of Bookkeeping Tasks
Typical financial transactions and tasks that are involved in bookkeeping include:

Billing for goods sold or services provided to clients
Recording receipts from customers
Verifying and recording invoices received from suppliers
Paying suppliers
Processing employees' pay and the related governmental reports
Monitoring individual accounts receivable
Recording depreciation and other adjusting entries
Providing financial reports

Today bookkeeping is done with the use of computer software. For example, QuickBooks (from Intuit) is a low-cost bookkeeping and accounting software package that is widely used by small businesses in the U.S.
Bookkeeping requires knowledge of debits and credits and a basic understanding of financial accounting, which includes the balance sheet and income statement.",what
What is the difference between cost and expense?,"Definition of Cost
A cost might be an expense or it might be an asset. 
Definition of Expense
An expense is a cost that has expired or was necessary in order to earn revenues. The matching principle guides accountants as to when a cost will be reported as an expense. 
Example of a Cost
A company's property insurance bill for the next six months of insurance shows a cost of $6,000. Initially the cost of $6,000 is reported as the current asset Prepaid Insurance (or Prepaid Expense) since the cost has not been used up (has not expired).
Example of an Expense
As a prepaid cost such as the $6,000 in the asset account Prepaid Insurance expires, the part that expires will be reported on the income statement as Insurance Expense. If the insurance cost is expiring at a rate of $1,000 per month, then each month the amount in the asset account Prepaid Insurance will decrease by $1,000 and Insurance Expense of $1,000 will be reported on the income statement.",what
What is the role of a company's controller?,"Definition of Company Controller
A company's controller is considered to be the chief accounting officer and the head of the accounting department.
Role of the Controller
As head of the accounting department, the controller will be responsible for the company's:

Financial statements
General ledger
Cost accounting
Payroll
Accounts payable
Accounts receivable
Budgeting
Special analyses as well as other duties

At larger companies the controller may be assisted by other accountants. Those assisting could have have titles such as assistant controller, accounting manager, cost accounting manager, tax manager, accounts payable manager, credit manager, payroll manager, and so on. These managers may then be supervising accountants and accounting clerks.
At smaller companies it is possible that the controller will be the only accountant and will be assisted by an accounts payable clerk.
The controller for a large company might report to the chief financial officer (CFO), while the controller for a small company may be reporting directly to the president or owner.",what
How is the account Cash Short and Over used?,"Definition of Cash Short and Over Account
The account Cash Short and Over is an income statement account (within a company's general ledger) in which shortages or overages of cash are recorded. The Cash Short and Over account might be used by:

A bank to record daily differences (if any) between a teller's actual cash at the end of the day versus the expected amount of cash based on checks cashed, deposits received, etc.
A company to record unexplained differences arising when a company's petty cash fund is replenished

The account Cash Short and Over provides a way to monitor employees' cash handling proficiency.
Generally, the amounts in the account Cash Short and Over are so small that the account balance will be included with other insignificant amounts reported on the income statement as Other Expenses.
Example of How the Account Cash Short and Over is Used
Let's illustrate the Cash Short and Over account with the petty cash fund. Assume that the company has a petty cash fund of $100 and its general ledger account Petty Cash reports an imprest balance of $100. Let's now assume that when the petty cash fund is replenished, there is $6.00 on hand and there are $93.00 of petty cash vouchers. This indicates a shortage of $1.00.
Using the above information, the journal entry to replenish the petty cash fund will include a credit of $94.00 to the account Cash: Checking Account. (This is the amount of the company check that will be cashed to get the cash in the petty cash fund back to the imprest general ledger amount of $100.) The debits will be the accounts and amounts shown on the petty cash receipts, which total $93. To get the journal entry to balance, a debit of $1 is recorded in Cash Short and Over.",what
How is a voucher used in accounts payable?,"Definition of Voucher
A voucher is often a prenumbered form used in the accounts payable department to standardize and enhance a company's internal control over payments to its vendors and service providers.
Example of a Voucher
You could think of the voucher used in accounts payable as a cover sheet to which necessary supporting documents and approvals are attached. Some of the supporting documents include:

The vendor's invoice
The company's purchase order
The company's receiving report
Payee/vendor name
Discount terms
Amount and date to be paid
General ledger account numbers to be charged
Authorizing signatures

The voucher is then recorded in the voucher register.
The unpaid vouchers provide the detail for the total amount reported as vouchers payable or accounts payable.
As a voucher's payment date comes near, the voucher is forwarded to an authorized person for payment. After making payment, a copy of the check is attached and the voucher is stamped ""Paid.""  It is then filed in the paid voucher file in order to prevent a duplicate payment.",what
What is a temporary account?,"Definition of Temporary Account
A temporary account is a general ledger account that begins each accounting year with a zero balance. Then at the end of the year its account balance is removed by transferring the amount to another account. This is done through closing entries. Temporary accounts are also referred to as nominal accounts.
All of the income statement accounts are classified as temporary accounts. A few other accounts such as the owner's drawing account and the income summary account are also temporary accounts. 
Examples of Temporary Accounts
Temporary accounts include all of the various groups of income statement accounts:

Revenues
Expenses
Gains
Losses

Having temporary income statement accounts makes for easy reporting of each year's details. After the amounts for the year have been reported on the income statement, the balances in the temporary accounts will end up in a permanent account such as a corporation's retained earnings account or in a sole proprietor's capital account. (In a manual system, the balances in the income statement accounts will first be closed to an income summary account. Next, the income summary balance will be transferred to the corporation's retained earnings or to the sole proprietor's capital account.)
A temporary account that is not an income statement account is the proprietor's drawing account. The balance in the drawing account is transferred directly to the owner's capital account and will not be reported on the income statement or in an income summary account.",what
What are sundry expenses?,"Definition of Sundry Expenses
In accounting and bookkeeping, sundry expenses are expenses that are small in amount and rare in occurrence. For these rare and insignificant expenses, a company might use a general ledger account entitled Sundry Expenses for these items.
If any of the items recorded in Sundry Expenses begin to occur frequently and/or become significant, a new account should be opened for such items.
Sundry expenses could also refer to a line on a company's income statement. Such a line will likely include the combined total of several expense accounts that have small balances.
Today, we are likely to use the description Miscellaneous Expenses for these items.",what
Where are accruals reflected on the balance sheet?,"Definition of Accruals
The accrual of expenses and liabilities refers to expenses and/or liabilities that a company has incurred, but the company has not yet paid or recorded the transaction. The accrual of an expense will usually involve an accrual adjusting entry that increases a company's expenses and increases its current liabilities.
The accrual of revenues and assets refers to revenues and/or assets that a company has earned, but the company has not yet received the money nor has it recorded the transaction. The accrual of revenues will usually involve an accrual adjusting entry that increases a company's revenues and increases its current assets.
Example of an Accrual as a Current Liability
Assume that a company has an emergency sewer repair on December 30. The plumbing contractor said the bill will be finalized and mailed to the company on January 10; however, the bill will be approximately $6,000. The company will need to accrue the expense incurred and the related current liability before the December 31 financial statements are prepared. The adjusting entry will debit Repairs Expense for $6,000, and credit Accrued Expenses Payable for $6,000.
Examples of other expenses that usually need an accrual adjusting entry resulting in a current liability include wages, utilities, bonuses, taxes, and interest.
Example of an Accrual as a Current Asset
Assume that during December a company has earned interest of $5,000 on its investment in U.S. Treasury bills. However, the interest will be received by the company on February 15. The company needs to accrue the revenue it earned and the related current asset before the December 31 financial statements are prepared. The adjusting entry will debit Interest Receivable for $5,000, and credit Investment Income for $5,000.

What is the proper accounting for supplies?,"Definition of Supplies
Office supplies are items used to carry out tasks in a company's departments outside of manufacturing or shipping. Office supplies are likely to include paper, printer cartridges, pens, etc. 
Shipping supplies are the cartons, tape, shrink wrap, etc. for preparing products that are being shipped to customers.
Manufacturing supplies are items used in the manufacturing facilities, but are not a direct material for the products manufactured. These will include a wide variety of items from cleaning supplies to machine lubricants.
Accounting for Office Supplies
The cost of office supplies on hand at the end of an accounting period should be the balance in a current asset account such as Supplies or Supplies on Hand. The cost of the office supplies used up during the accounting period should be recorded in the income statement account Supplies Expense. When supplies are purchased, the amount will be debited to Supplies. At the end of the accounting period, the balance in the account Supplies will be adjusted to be the amount on hand, and the amount of the adjustment will be recorded in Supplies Expense. (If the amount of supplies on hand is insignificant, a company may simply debit Supplies Expense when the supplies are purchased.) 
Accounting for Shipping Supplies
The cost of shipping supplies on hand will be reported as a current asset on the balance sheet and the shipping supplies used during the accounting period will be reported on the income statement as Shipping Supplies Expense.
Accounting for Manufacturing Supplies
The cost of manufacturing supplies on hand at the end of an accounting period will be reported in a balance sheet current asset account such as Inventory of Manufacturing Supplies. (There are likely to be several accounts or sub-accounts in order keep track of the manufacturing supplies by category.) When the manufacturing supplies are used they will become part of the manufacturing overhead, which is then allocated to the products manufactured.",what
What is a petty cash voucher?,"Definition of Petty Cash Voucher
A petty cash voucher is usually a small form that is used to document a disbursement (payment) from a petty cash fund. Petty cash vouchers are also referred to as petty cash receipts and can be purchased from office supply stores.
The petty cash voucher should provide space for the following:

Date
Amount disbursed
Person receiving the money
Reason for the disbursement
General ledger account to be charged
Initials of the person disbursing the money from the petty cash fund

Some petty cash vouchers are prenumbered and sometimes a number is assigned for reference and control. Receipts or other documentation justifying the disbursement should be attached to the petty cash voucher.
When the petty cash fund is replenished, the completed petty cash vouchers provide the documentation for the replenishment check.
Example of Petty Cash Voucher

Shown above is an example of a petty cash voucher.",what
What is a trade discount?,"Definition of Trade Discount
A trade discount is a routine reduction from the regular, established price of a product. The use of trade discounts allows a company to vary the final price based on each customer's volume or status.
Note that trade discounts are different from early-payment discounts. (Early-payment discounts of 1% or 2% are usually recorded by the seller in an account such as Sales Discounts and by the buyer using the periodic inventory method in an account such as Purchase Discounts.) Trade discounts are not recorded in a separate account by either the seller or the buyer.
Example of Trade Discounts
A distributor of merchandise may have a single catalog which displays a single price for each product. However, the distributor allows a trade discount from the catalog price based on each customer's volume. For example, one product may have a catalog price of $100. A casual buyer will be charged $100. However, a reseller will be given a trade discount of 20% from the catalog price, and will be charged $80. Lastly, a registered high-volume wholesaler will be given a trade discount of 27% and will be charged $73.
Recording Sales Having a Trade Discount
The company selling the product (and the buyer of the product) will record the transaction at the amount after the trade discount is subtracted. For example, when goods with list prices totaling $1,000 are sold to a wholesaler that is entitled to a 27% trade discount, both the seller and the buyer will record the transaction at $730. There will not be a general ledger account entitled Trade Discount.",what
How is a short term bank loan recorded?,"Definition of Short Term Bank Loan
When a company borrows money from its bank and agrees to repay the loan amount within a year, the company will record the loan by increasing its cash and increasing a current liability such as Notes Payable or Loans Payable. The bank will record the loan by increasing a current asset such as Loans to Customers or Loans Receivable and increasing a current liability such as Customer Demand Deposits.
Example of a Company Recording a Loan from a Bank
Let's assume that a company obtains a $30,000 bank loan that must be repaid within 9 months. The bank deposits the loan proceeds of $30,000 into the company's checking account at the same bank.
The double entry to be recorded by the company is: 1) a debit of $30,000 to the company's current asset account Cash for the amount that the bank deposited into the company's checking account, and 2) a credit of $30,000 to the company's current liability account Notes Payable (or Loans Payable) for the amount of principal that it must repay to the bank. (If there is a difference between the two amounts, it may pertain to bank fees or prepaid interest that will also have to be recorded.)
Example of a Bank Recording a Loan to a Customer
The double entry to be recorded by the bank is: 1) a debit to the bank's current asset account Loans to Customers or Loans Receivable for the principal amount it expects to collect, and 2) a credit to the bank's current liability account Customer Demand Deposits. (If there is a difference between the two amounts, it may pertain to bank fees or prepaid interest that will also have to be recorded.)",what
What is the operating cycle?,"Operating cycle definition
The operating cycle is the time required for a company's cash to be put into its operations and then return to the company's cash account.
Operating cycle example
A manufacturer's operating cycle is amount of time required for the manufacturer's cash to be used to:

pay for the raw materials needed in its products
pay for the labor and overhead costs needed to convert the raw materials into products
hold the finished products in inventory until they are sold
wait for the customers' cash payments to be collected

The operating cycle is the sum of the following:

the days' sales in inventory (365 days/inventory turnover ratio), plus
the average collection period (365 days/accounts receivable turnover ratio)

The operating cycle has importance in classifying current assets and current liabilities. While most manufacturers have operating cycles of several months, a few industries require very long processing times. This could result in an operating cycle that is longer than one year. To accommodate those industries, the accountants' definitions of current assets and current liabilities include the following phrase: ...within one year or within the operating cycle, whichever is longer.

What is revenue?,"Definition of Revenue
Revenue is the amount a company receives from selling goods and/or providing services to its customers and clients. A company's revenue, which is reported on the first line of its income statement, is often described as sales or service revenues. Hence, revenue is the amount earned from customers and clients before subtracting the company's expenses. 
Revenue vs Net Income
While revenue is the top line on a company's income statement, net income is often referred to as the bottom line.
The difference between the amount of revenue and the amount of net income is significant. Here are some hypothetical amounts to illustrate the point:

Revenue from sales of products $300,000
Cost of the products that were sold $200,000
Expenses (wages, rent, ads, etc.) $88,000
Net income (before tax) $12,000

Using the above amounts we see that the company's net income was only 4% of its revenue ($12,000/$300,000). 
Calculating Revenue
The best way to calculate a company's revenue during an accounting period (year, month, etc.) is to sum up the amounts earned (as opposed to the amounts of cash that were received). For example, if a new company sold $75,000 of goods in December but allows the customer to pay 30 days later, the company's December sales are $75,000 (even though no cash was received in December). Reporting revenues in the period in which they are earned is known as the accrual basis of accounting. Hence, a company's revenue could occur before the cash is received, after the cash is received, or at time that the cash is received.
(Note that for income tax reporting, smaller companies may use the cash basis of accounting.)
Examples of Revenue
Common examples of revenue include:

A retailer's sales of merchandise, sales of extended warranties, and repair revenues
The fees earned by a law firm for legal services provided to clients
The amounts earned by publishers of magazines, newspapers, and electronic information

Revenue vs Income
It is important to note that many people use the term income to mean revenue. Perhaps a business owner sees money ""coming in"" from customers and logically refers to it as ""income"". However, it is best to use the word sales or revenue when referring to the amounts earned from customers, and to use the word income for an amount that reflects the subtraction of expenses.",what
What is a credit balance?,"Definition of Credit Balance
In accounting and bookkeeping, a credit balance is the ending amount found on the right side of a general ledger account or subsidiary ledger account.
Examples of Credit Balances
A credit balance is normal and expected for the following accounts:

Liability accounts such as Accounts Payable, Notes Payable, Wages Payable, Interest Payable, Income Taxes Payable, Customer Deposits, Deferred Income Taxes, etc. Hence, a credit balance in Accounts Payable indicates the amount owed to vendors. (If a liability account would have a debit balance it indicates that the company has paid more than the amount owed, has made an incorrect entry, etc.)
Equity accounts including the stockholders' equity accounts Common Stock, Paid-in Capital in Excess of Par Value, Retained Earnings, and the owner's equity account M. Smith, Capital
Revenue accounts and gain accounts such as Sales Revenues, Service Revenues, Interest Revenues, Gain on Disposal of Equipment, Gain from Lawsuit, and many others
Contra-asset accounts including Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Accumulated Depreciation. These credit balances allow for the reporting of both the gross and net amounts for accounts receivable and for property, plant and equipment
Contra-expense accounts such as Purchases Discounts, Purchases Returns and Allowances, and Expenses Reimbursed by Employees. The credit balances in these accounts allow the company to report both the gross and net amounts.",what
What is accrued interest?,"Definition of Accrued Interest
Accrued interest is the amount of loan interest that has already occurred, but has not yet been paid by the borrower and not yet received by the lender.
Under the accrual basis of accounting, the amount of accrued interest is to be recorded with accrual adjusting entries by the borrower and the lender before issuing their financial statements.
The borrower's adjusting entry will debit Interest Expense and credit Accrued Interest Payable (a current liability). The lender's adjusting entry will debit Accrued Interest Receivable (a current asset) and credit Interest Revenue (or Income).
Example of Accrued Interest
Let's assume that on December 16, a company borrows $20,000 from its bank at an annual interest rate of 6%. The first interest payment is due 30 days later on January 15. Both the company and the bank have accounting years which end on December 31.
The accrued interest as of December 31 is $50 ($20,000 X 6% = $1,200 per year = $100 per month = $50 for 1/2 month).
The company's adjusting entry will debit Interest Expense for $50, and will credit Accrued Interest Payable for $50.
The bank's adjusting entry will debit Accrued Interest Receivable for $50, and will credit Interest Revenue for $50.",what
Why are revenues credited?,"Why Revenues are Credited
Revenues cause owner's equity to increase. Since the normal balance for owner's equity is a credit balance, revenues must be recorded as a credit. At the end of the accounting year, the credit balances in the revenue accounts will be closed and transferred to the owner's capital account, thereby increasing owner's equity. (At a corporation, the credit balances in the revenue accounts will be closed and transferred to Retained Earnings, which is a stockholders' equity account.)
It may be helpful to think of the accounting equation, Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity, to understand why an asset (shown on the left side of the accounting equation) will normally have its account balance on the left side or debit side. Liabilities and owner's equity accounts (shown on the right side of the accounting equation) will normally have their account balances on the right side or credit side.
Example of Why Revenues are Credited
To illustrate why revenues are credited, let's assume that a company receives $900 at the time that it provides a service and therefore is earning the $900. The increase in the company's assets will be recorded with a debit of $900 to Cash. Since every entry must have debits equal to credits, a credit of $900 will be recorded in the account Service Revenues. The credit entry in Service Revenues also means that owner's equity will be increasing.
If the company earns an additional $500 of revenue but allows the customer to pay in 30 days, the company will increase its asset account Accounts Receivable with a debit of $500. It must also record a credit of $500 in Service Revenues because the revenue was earned. The credit entry in Service Revenues also means that the owner's equity will be increasing.",what
What is the difference between a debit and a debit balance?,"Definition of Debit
A debit is an entry on the left side of a T-account.
A debit entry is used to record assets, expenses, losses, and owner's draws in their appropriate general ledger accounts. A debit reduces the amounts in liability and owner's (stockholders') equity accounts.
Definition of Debit Balance
A debit balance is the normal balance in the general ledger accounts for assets, expenses, losses, and owner's draws.
Example of Debit and Debit Balance
Let's assume that a person starts a business as a sole proprietorship with an investment of $5,000. The entry to business accounts will include a debit to Cash for $5,000. On the next day, the business spends $1,000 to purchase office equipment. Part of this entry will include a credit to Cash for $1,000. After this transaction is recorded, the Cash account will have a debit balance of $4,000.",what
What is the income summary account?,"Definition of Income Summary Account
The Income Summary account is a temporary account used with closing entries in a manual accounting system. (Computerized accounting systems may close the temporary accounts without recording the amounts in an Income Summary account.)
The Income Summary is very temporary since it has a zero balance throughout the year until the year-end closing entries are made. Next, the balance resulting from the closing entries will be moved to Retained Earnings (if a corporation) or the owner's capital account (if a sole proprietorship).
Example of Income Summary Account
In a manual accounting system, the closing entries will result in the following amounts in Income Summary:

A credit amount for the total amount of the general ledger income statement accounts that had credit balances
A debit amount for the total amount of the general ledger income statement accounts that had debit balances

Next, if the Income Summary has a credit balance, the amount is the company's net income. The Income Summary will be closed with a debit for that amount and a credit to Retained Earnings or the owner's capital account.
If the Income Summary has a debit balance, the amount is the company's net loss. The Income Summary will be closed with a credit for that amount and a debit to Retained Earnings or the owner's capital account.",what
Would you please explain unearned income?,"Definition of Unearned Income
Unearned income or deferred income is a receipt of money before it has been earned. This is also referred to as deferred revenues or customer deposits. The unearned amount is initially recorded in a liability account such as Deferred Income, Deferred Revenues, or Customer Deposits. As the amount is earned, the liability account is reduced and the amount earned will be reported on the income statement as revenues.
Example #1 of Unearned Income
A lawn service company offers customers a special package of five applications of fertilizers and weed treatments for $300. However, the customer must prepay in December for the five treatments that will be done between April and September. When the company receives the $300 in December, it will debit the asset Cash for $300 and will credit the liability account Unearned Revenues. Since these are balance sheet accounts (and since no work has yet been performed), there are no revenues to be reported in December. In April when the first service is provided, the company will debit the liability account Unearned Revenues for $60 and will credit the income statement account Service Revenues for $60. At the end of April, the balance sheet will report the company's remaining liability of $240. The income statement for April will report the $60 that was earned. The $60 entry is referred to as an adjusting entry and the same entry will be recorded when each of the remaining four treatments are provided.
Example #2 of Unearned Income
A company informs a new customer that a $5,000 deposit is required before it will begin work on the customer's special order. The customer gives the company $5,000 on December 28 and the company will begin work on the special order on January 3. On December 28 the company will debit Cash for $5,000 and will credit a liability account, such as Customer Deposits (or Unearned Revenues or Deferred Revenues) for $5,000. No revenue is reported in December for this special order since the company did not perform any work in December. When the special order begins and is completed in January, the company will debit the liability account for $5,000 and will credit a revenue account.",what
What is the accounting equation?,"Definition of Accounting Equation
The accounting equation of a sole proprietorship is assets = liabilities + owner's equity. For a corporation, the accounting equation is assets = liabilities + stockholders' equity.
The accounting equation is similar to the format of the balance sheet.
The accounting equation will always remain in balance if the double entry system of accounting is followed accurately.
Example of the Accounting Equation
Let's assume that a person starts a new sole proprietorship business by investing $10,000. The new business will now have: $10,000 of assets = $0 of liabilities + $10,000 of owner's equity. Next, let's assume the company purchases equipment at a cost of $3,000 and signs a promise to pay the $3,000 within six months. Now the company's accounting equation will contain these amounts: $13,000 of assets = $3,000 of liabilities + $10,000 of owner's equity.
Next, let's assume the new company completes a service for another business and earns revenues of $1,500 and allows the business to pay in 10 days. This means the new company will have an account (or trade) receivable of $1,500 and will have an additional $1,500 of owner's equity. After this transaction, the accounting equation will show: $14,500 of assets = $3,000 of liabilities + $11,500 of owner's equity.",what
What is the meaning of aging?,"Definition of Aging
In accounting,  the term aging  is often associated with a company's accounts receivable. Accounts receivable arise when a company provides goods or services and allows the customer to pay 10 or 30 days later. If some customers do not honor the terms of the sale, the company can experience a temporary or even permanent cash flow problem. In order for the company to minimize these potential problems, a company is wise to routinely review an aging of accounts receivable. 
The aging of accounts receivable sorts the company's accounts receivables by customer and then by time since the sales invoice was issued. Generally, the older the unpaid sales invoice, the greater the likelihood of not collecting the full amount.
Since the aging of accounts receivable is a standard feature of accounting software, it is available with a click of the mouse. The aging is also useful for estimating the amount needed in the related account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.
Example of an Aging Report
The aging report lists each customer's name and its unpaid sales invoices that make up the account receivable balance. Then the amounts of each unpaid sales invoice are placed in one of six columns that appear to the right. The headings for those columns are: Current, 1-30 days past due, 31-60 days past due, 61-90 days past due, 91-120 days past due, and 120+ days past due. The aging of accounts receivable gives the company's management a valuable and easy-to-read report that highlights the customers with past due sales invoices. 
An aging can also be prepared for the company's accounts payable. The aging of accounts payable is based on the dates that the vendors' invoices are to be paid.",what
Which accounts get closed at the end of a fiscal year?,"The temporary accounts get closed at the end of an accounting year. Temporary accounts include all of the income statement accounts (revenues, expenses, gains, losses), the sole proprietor's drawing account, the income summary account, and any other account that is used for keeping a tally of the current year amounts. Since the temporary accounts are closed at the end of each fiscal year, they will begin the new fiscal year with zero balances.
The accounts that do not get closed (their balances are carried forward to the next accounting year) are referred to as permanent accounts. The balance sheet accounts are permanent accounts.",what
What is a revenue expenditure?,"Definition of Revenue Expenditure
A revenue expenditure is a cost that will be an expense in the accounting period when the expenditure takes place.
Revenue expenditures are often discussed in the context of fixed assets. The revenue expenditures take place after a fixed asset had been put into service and simply keeps the asset in working order. (The amount spent to acquire a fixed asset is referred to as a capital expenditure. The amount of the capital expenditure will be recorded as an asset and will then be moved to the income statement as depreciation expense over the years of the asset's useful life.)
Example of Revenue Expenditure
Let's assume that a company made a capital expenditure of $100,000 to install a high efficiency machine. The new machine requires routine maintenance of $3,000 each month. This $3,000 is a revenue expenditure since it will be reported on the monthly income statement, thereby being matched with the month's revenues. Normal repairs to the machine are also a revenue expenditure, since the expenditure does not make the machine more than it was, nor does it extend the machine's useful life. As a result, normal repairs will also be reported on the income statement as an expense in the accounting period when the repair is made.",what
What are the effects of depreciation?,"Definition of Depreciation
Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the cost of a company's assets used in its business from the balance sheet to the income statement (as an expense) over their estimated useful lives.
Depreciation occurs through an accounting adjusting entry in which the account Depreciation Expense is debited and the contra asset account Accumulated Depreciation is credited.
Effects of Depreciation
The following are some of the effects for a corporation that is depreciating assets:

The net income, retained earnings, and stockholders' equity are reduced with the debit to Depreciation Expense
The carrying value of the assets being depreciated and amount of total assets are reduced by the credit to Accumulated Depreciation
The depreciation expense reported on the U.S. income tax return (based on the tax regulations) reduces a corporation's taxable income (and its related income tax payments).",what
What is the difference between interest expense and interest payable?,"Definition of Interest Expense
Assuming the accrual method of accounting, interest expense is the amount of interest that was incurred on debt during a period of time. Interest Expense is also the title of the income statement account that is used to record the interest incurred. Lastly, interest expense is usually a separate line on a company's income statement that indicates the amount that occurred during the period appearing in the heading of the income statement.
Definition of Interest Payable
Interest payable is the amount of interest the company has incurred but has not yet paid as of the date of the balance sheet. Interest Payable is also the title of the current liability account that is used to record and report this amount.
Examples of Interest Expense and Interest Payable
To illustrate the difference between interest expense and interest payable, let's assume that a company borrows $200,000 on November 1 at an annual interest rate of 6%. The company is required to pay each month's interest on the 15th day of the following month. Therefore, the November interest of $1,000 ($200,000 x 6% x 1/12) is to be paid on December 15. The $1,000 of interest incurred during December is to be paid on January 15. Therefore, as of December 31, the company's current liability account Interest Payable must report $1,000 for December's interest. For the two-month period, the company will report Interest Expense of $2,000 (November's and December's interest of $1,000 each month).",what
What is a debit balance?,"Definition of Debit Balance
In accounting and bookkeeping, a debit balance is the ending amount found on the left side of a general ledger account or subsidiary ledger account.
Examples of Debit Balances
A debit balance is normal and expected for the following accounts:

Asset accounts such as Cash, Accounts Receivable, Inventory, Prepaid Expenses, Buildings, Equipment, etc. For example, a debit balance in the Cash account indicates a positive amount of cash. (Therefore, a credit balance in Cash indicates a negative amount likely caused by writing checks for more than the amount of money currently on hand.)
Expense accounts and loss accounts including Cost of Goods Sold, Wages Expense, Rent Expense, Interest Expense, Loss on Disposal of Equipment, Loss from Lawsuit, etc. (The debit balances in these accounts will be transferred to Retained Earnings or to the proprietor's capital account at the end of each accounting year.)
Contra-revenue accounts including Sales Discounts, Sales Returns, etc. (The debit balances in these accounts allow for the reporting of both the gross and net amounts of sales. These balances will also be transferred to retained earnings or the owner's capital account at the end of each accounting year.)
Contra-liability accounts such as Discount on Bonds Payable or Unamortized Bond Issue Costs. (These debit balances allow for the presentation of both the maturity value and the book or carrying value of the bonds.)
Contra-equity accounts such as the owner's drawing account and Treasury Stock. (The debit balance in the drawing account will be closed to the owner's capital account thereby reducing the respective balance at the end of each year. The debit balance in Treasury Stock is not closed at the end of the year. It serves as a reduction to the total amount of Stockholders' Equity.)",what
What is the difference between a ledger and a trial balance?,"Definition of a Ledger
A ledger is often defined as a book of accounts. Today the ledger and its accounts are likely to be an electronic record or file.
Example of a Ledger
An example of a ledger is a company's general ledger, which contains all of its asset, liability, owner equity, revenue, expense, gain, and loss accounts. Each account contains the transaction amounts that pertain to the account title. 
Definition of a Trial Balance
A trial balance is a listing of the account names and their balances from the general ledger. The debit balance amounts are in one column and the credit balance amounts are in the adjacent column. (Usually accounts with zero balances are not listed.) If the totals of the two columns are equal, accountants are comforted in knowing that the general ledger has its debits equal to credits. The trial balance is an internal accounting report that merely documents the equality of debits and credits. It is not a financial statement.
The trial balance was crucial internal report when the accounting records were maintained and updated manually. With a manual system, part of an entry may have been omitted, one of the transaction amounts may have had digits transposed, math errors may have occurred when calculating an account's balance, etc. Today's accounting software is coded to prevent these types of errors. As a result, it is rare to see a computerized trial balance that does not have the total amount of debits equal to the total amount of credits.",what
What is a bill payable?,"Definition of Bill Payable
A bill payable is a document which shows the amount owed for goods or services received on credit (meaning not paid at the time that the goods or services were received). The provider of the goods or services is referred to as the supplier or vendor. Hence, a bill payable is also known as an unpaid vendor invoice.
Examples of Bills Payable
Examples of a bill payable include a monthly telephone bill, the monthly bill for the electricity used, a bill for repairs that were completed, the bill for merchandise purchased by a retailer on credit, etc. 
Recording a Bill Payable
Under the accrual method of accounting or bookkeeping, a bill payable or unpaid vendor invoice is recorded in Accounts Payable with a credit entry. (The debit will likely be recorded as an expense or asset.) When the bill is paid, Accounts Payable will be reduced with a debit entry, and Cash will be decreased with a credit entry.
The credit balance in Accounts Payable is reported on the company's balance sheet as a current liability.",what
When should costs be expensed and when should costs be capitalized?,"Definition of Costs
In the context of the question, costs are the amounts paid in exchange for materials, products, or services. The costs could be:

Reported as an expense on the current period's income statement, or
Reported as an asset and expensed later. To defer the cost to the balance sheet is to capitalize the costs.

Examples of Costs Being Expensed
Costs are reported as expenses  in the accounting period when they are used up, have expired, or have no future economic value which can be measured. For example, the June salaries for the company's marketing team should be reported as an expense in June since the future economic value cannot be measured/determined.
Another example is the amount spent to repair equipment that broke in June and was repaired in June. The cost of the repair merely restored the equipment to its same condition. Since there was no additional future economic value added, the costs of repair is reported as an expense on the June income statement.
Example of Costs Being Capitalized
Costs are capitalized (recorded as assets) when the costs have not been used up and have future economic value. Assume that a company incurs a cost of $30,000 in June to add a hydraulic lift to its delivery truck that had no lift. The remaining useful life of the truck and the lift is 5 years. The cost of $30,000 should be capitalized since it added future economic value by making an improvement to the truck. The $30,000 cost increases the company's assets, but will be reduced by depreciating the cost to expense over the next 5 years.",what
Why does a company prepare a bank reconciliation?,"Reasons for Preparing a Bank Reconciliation
There are several reasons for a company to prepare a bank reconciliation:

To safeguard the company's cash. Performing a bank reconciliation results in improved internal control over the company's cash if the reconciliation is done by someone other than the person handling and/or recording receipts and payments. Having this additional person prepare the bank reconciliation reduces the odds of an improper use of the company's cash.
To improve the confidence that the amount of cash that is reported on the company's balance sheet is accurate. The additions and deductions on the bank statement are compared (or reconciled) with the items that are entered in the company's general ledger Cash account. Some differences, such as outstanding checks and deposits in transit, are noted as simply timing differences.
Since most companies use the double-entry system of accounting, any omission or error in the company's general ledger Cash account also means that at least one other general ledger account will have a corresponding omission or error. For example, if a company had wired money from its bank account for emergency computer maintenance services and had not recorded the credit to its Cash account, it is also omitting the debit to the account Computer Maintenance Expense. The bank reconciliation could prevent this omission from occurring.",what
What is an adjusted trial balance?,"Definition of an Adjusted Trial Balance
The adjusted trial balance is an internal document that lists the general ledger account titles and their balances after any adjustments have been made. The adjusted trial balance is not a financial statement, but the adjusted account balances will be reported on the financial statements.
The adjusted trial balance (as well as the unadjusted trial balance) must have the total amount of the debit balances equal to the total amount of credit balances.
Examples of Adjusted Trial Balances
In a manual accounting system, an unadjusted trial balance might be prepared by a bookkeeper to be certain that the general ledger has debit amounts equal to the credit amounts. After that is the case, the unadjusted trial balance is used by an accountant to indicate the necessary adjusting entries and the resulting adjusted balances. The adjusted balances are summed to become the adjusted trial balance. 
An adjusted trial balance can also refer to a trial balance where the account balances are adjusted by the external auditors. The adjusted balances become the adjusted trial balance.",what
What is accrued income?,"Definition of Accrued Income
Accrued income is an amount that:

A company has earned
The company has a right to receive
The collection is probable
Has not yet been recorded in the general ledger accounts

Under the accrual basis of accounting, accrued income is recorded with an accrual adjusting entry prior to issuing the financial statements.
Example of Accrued Income
One example of accrued income is the interest a company earns on a bond investment. To illustrate, let's assume that a company invested $100,000 on December 1 in a 6% $100,000 bond that pays $3,000 of interest on each June 1 and December 1. On December 31, the company will have earned one month's interest amounting to $500 ($100,000 x 6% per year x 1/12 of a year, or 1/6 of the semiannual $3,000). No interest will be received in December since it will be included in the $3,000 interest that will be received on June 1. The $500 of interest that has been earned during December, but not yet received nor previously recorded as of December 31, is accrued interest income.
The accrued interest income will be recorded with an accrual adjusting entry dated December 31 that debits Interest Receivable (a balance sheet account) for $500, and credits Interest Income (an income statement account) for $500.",what
What is a general ledger?,"Definition of General Ledger
A general ledger is a grouping of perhaps hundreds of accounts that are used to sort and store information from a company's business transactions. The general ledger is organized as follows:

balance sheet accounts (assets, liabilities, equity), and
income statement accounts (revenues, expenses, gains, losses)

Under the double entry system of accounting and bookkeeping, every business transaction will affect two (or more) general ledger accounts. In addition, each transaction's debit amount(s) must be equal to its credit amounts. As a result, the general ledger is expected to have the total amount of debits equal to the total amount of credits. Further, when the account balances are listed on a trial balance, the totals should be equal.
Examples of a General Ledger
In a manual accounting or bookkeeping system, the general ledger is a ""book"" with a separate page or ledger sheet for each account. (When a significant amount of detailed information is needed for an account such as Accounts Receivable, a subsidiary ledger is often used.)
In a computerized system, the general ledger will be an electronic file of all the needed accounts. This also facilitates the electronic preparation of the company's financial statements.",what
What is meant by owner's draws?,"Definition of Owner's Draws
Owner's draws are withdrawals of a sole proprietorship's cash or other assets made by the owner for the owner's personal use. The account in which the draws are recorded is a contra owner's capital account or contra owner's equity account since its debit balance is contrary to the normal credit balance of the owner's equity or capital account.
The title of the account for recording R. Smith's draws from his or her business is R. Smith, Drawing or R. Smith, Withdrawals. This account is a temporary account because its balance will be closed at the end of each year. However, the account's debit balance is closed directly to the owner's capital account. (The owner's draws are not reported as an expense on the company's income statement.) 
Example of Owner's Draws
Let's assume that R. Smith, the owner of a sole proprietorship, withdraws $2,000 each month for the owner's household expenses. The company's entry to record each month's draws will be:

A debit to R. Smith, Drawing (an owner's equity account with a debit balance)
A credit to Cash",what
Is a prepaid expense recorded initially as an expense?,"Definition of Prepaid Expense
A prepaid expense refers to an amount that a company has paid and a portion or all of it will be an expense in a later accounting period.
Example of a Prepaid Expense
A company with an accounting year ending on December 31 has a prepaid expense if on December 1, it paid $6,000 for insurance coverage from December 1 through May 31.
Recording a Prepaid Expense
A prepaid expense can be recorded initially as an expense or as a current asset. Either way, adjusting entries will be needed during the six months to be certain that:

The current month's insurance expense of $1,000 ($6,000/6 months) is reported on each month's income statement.
The unexpired amount of the prepaid insurance is reported on the balance sheet as of the last day of each month. For example, on December 31 the balance sheet must report $5,000. On January 31 the balance sheet must report $4,000, and so on.",what
What is the difference between an invoice and a statement?,"Definition of an Invoice
An invoice received from a supplier shows the items purchased, the cost per unit, the total cost or extension of each item, the total of all the items listed on the invoice, the terms of the sale, etc.
Definition of a Statement
A statement from a supplier lists the amounts from past invoices that the customer has not paid. For example, the statement from a supplier might indicate that as of July 31 the customer owes the entire amounts from four invoices and a small amount from a fifth invoice.
However, it is possible that the statement amount is not the current amount owed. For instance, it is possible that on July 30 and on August 3 the customer had paid the amounts owed for two of the invoices listed on the statement. For this reason, companies are wise to have the policy to make payments only from invoices and never from statements. The purpose of this policy is to avoid paying a supplier's invoice twice.",what
What is a purchase return?,"Definition of Purchase Return
A purchase return occurs when a buyer returns merchandise that it had purchased from a supplier. Since the return of purchased merchandise is time consuming and costly, under the periodic inventory system there will be an account Purchases Returns. This allows the company's management to see the magnitude of the returns that occurred.
The account Purchases Returns is a general ledger account that will have a credit balance (or no balance). Its credit balance will offset the debit balance in the Purchases account. 
Example of a Purchase Return
Let's assume that a company using the periodic inventory system, purchased merchandise having a cost of $1,000 with terms of net 30 days. This was recorded with:

A debit to Purchases for $1,000
A credit to Accounts Payable for $1,000

A few days later, the company discovered that some of the merchandise it received was of a lower quality. The company notified the supplier and was instructed to return the merchandise. Assuming this merchandise had a cost of $200, the company recorded the purchases return as follows:

A debit to Accounts Payable for $200
A credit to Purchases Returns $200

The debit of $1,000 in the Purchases account and the credit of $200 in the Purchases Returns will mean that for this transaction the company had net purchases of $800.",what
"How, when and why do you prepare closing entries?","Definition of Closing Entries
Closing entries transfer the balances from the temporary accounts to a permanent or real account at the end of the accounting year.
As a result, the temporary accounts will begin the following accounting year with zero balances.
In a computerized accounting system, the closing entries are likely done electronically by simply selecting ""Closing Entries"" or by specifying the beginning and ending dates of the financial statements.
Examples of Closing Entries
Two examples of closing entries are:

The closing of the income statement accounts (revenues, expenses, gains, losses) by transferring their balances to the owner's capital account or the corporation's retained earnings account. This is done after the company's financial statements for the year have been prepared.
The closing of the owner's drawing account by transferring its balance to the owner's capital account.",what
What is bank balance and book balance?,"Definition of Bank Balance
The term bank balance is commonly used when reconciling the bank statement. It is also known as the balance per bank or balance per bank statement. Typically it is the ending balance on the bank statement for each month.
Example of Bank Balance
When a company receives its checking account statement from its bank showing June's activity, the ending balance on June 30 is the bank balance. (Generally, this bank balance will not agree with the amount in the company's records since some checks written by the company will not have cleared the bank by June 30. Similarly, some money received by the company on June 30 may not have been deposited in time for the amount to appear on the June bank statement.)
Definition of Book Balance
The term book balance, which is also used in the bank reconciliation is the amount shown in the company's general ledger for the bank account. Book balance is also referred to as the balance per books.
Example of Book Balance
The balance on June 30 in the company's general ledger account entitled Checking Account is the book balance that pertains to the bank account being reconciled. (For an individual, the book balance is likely to be the balance appearing in the person's check register.) It is common for the book balance to not agree with the balance on the bank statement as of the same day. This is the case when there are bank fees or electronic transfers on the bank statement that have not yet been recorded in the company's general ledger accounts. For example, the bank statement may reveal that a bank service charge was withdrawn from the account on the last day of the month.",what
What is the procedure for preparing a trial balance?,"Definition of a Trial Balance
A trial balance consists of the following information:

The title of each general ledger account that has a balance
To the right of the account titles are two columns for entering each account's balance. One column is headed Debit and the other column is headed Credit
Each account's balance is listed in the appropriate column
After all of the account balances are entered, each column is summed
The total of the debit column should be equal to the total of the credit column

Example of a Trial Balance
Today's accounting software can print a trial balance at the click of a mouse. Further, a computerized accounting system has eliminated the many math and clerical errors that had occurred with a manual accounting system.
Of course, a trial balance that has the total debits equal to the total credits does not mean that the general ledger is free of errors. For instance, recording a debit entry into the Equipment account instead of recording the debit in the Equipment Repairs Account will not be uncovered by the trial balance.",what
What is a long-term asset?,"Definition of Long-term Asset
A long-term asset is an asset that is not expected to be converted to cash or be consumed within one year of the date shown in the heading of the balance sheet. (If a company has an operating cycle that is longer than one year, a long-term asset is not expected to turn to cash within the operating cycle.) Expressed another way, a long-term asset is an asset that does not meet the criteria of being reported as a current asset. Hence, long-term assets are also known as noncurrent assets or long-lived assets. 
Examples of Long-term Assets
Long-term assets include the following:

Long-term investments. These include some investments in stocks and bonds of other corporations, a company's bond sinking fund, the cash surrender value of life insurance policies owned by the company, real estate awaiting to be sold, etc.
Property, plant and equipment. This classification includes land, buildings, machinery, equipment, vehicles, fixtures, etc. that are used in the business. These assets are reported at cost and the contra asset accumulated depreciation is also included.
Intangible assets. These include trademarks, patents, customer lists, goodwill, etc. that were acquired in a transaction.
Deferred charges. This category is used for items that do not fit into the other long-term asset classifications.",what
What is payroll accounting?,"Definition of Payroll Accounting
Payroll accounting involves a company's recording of its employees' compensation including:

gross wages, salaries, bonuses, commissions, and so on that have been earned by its employees
withholding of payroll taxes such as federal income taxes, Social Security taxes, Medicare taxes,  state income taxes (if applicable)
withholding for the employees' portion of health insurance premiums, employees' contributions to savings plans, garnishments of salaries and wages, employees' contributions to United Way, etc.
employer's portion/expense for Social Security taxes, Medicare taxes, state and federal unemployment taxes
employer's portion/expense of fringe benefits such as health and dental insurance, paid holidays, vacations and sick days, pension and savings plan contributions, worker compensation insurance, etc.

Example of Payroll Accounting
If a company's employees are paid weekly based on hours worked, the payroll processing is likely done during the first few days following the work week. If the company's accounting periods are calendar months (and the calendar year), the company will have to accrue for the wages and benefits earned by the hourly paid employees (which are not yet paid or recorded in the general ledger accounts) as of the last day of each month.
You can see more details including journal entries at our free Explanation of Payroll Accounting.",what
Is a loan payment an expense?,"Definition of Loan Payment
Generally a loan payment consists of:

An interest payment, which is an expense
A principal payment, which reduces the loan's principal balance

If the interest and principal portions of the loan payment are not listed, a loan amortization schedule will indicate the amounts.
If the loan payments are made on the last day of every month, the interest payment (or interest portion of the loan payment) will likely be the expense for the month. However, if the loan payment is made on a different day of the month, an accrual adjusting entry will be required to report the precise amount of interest for the month and the accrued interest liability at the end of the month.
The loan's principal balance is a liability such as Loans Payable or Notes Payable. The principal payments that are required in the next 12 months should be classified as a current liability. The remaining amount of principal owed should be classified as a long-term (or noncurrent) liability.
Example of Loan Payment
A company makes monthly payments of $500.00 on the last day of every month. Each month the interest portion decreases and the principal portion increases (as the result of a decreasing principal balance). A loan amortization schedule indicates that the interest portion of this month's payment is $112.49 and the principal portion is $387.51. Therefore, the loan payment will be recorded as follows:

Debit Interest Expense for $112.49
Debit Loan Payable for $387.51
Credit Cash for $500.00",what
What does overstated mean?,"Definition of Overstated
When an accountant uses the term overstated, it means two things:

The reported amount is incorrect, and
The reported amount is more than the true or correct amount.

As a result of double-entry accounting or bookkeeping, another item is likely to have a reporting error.
Example of Overstated
If a company reports that its prepaid insurance is $8,000, but the true or correct amount of prepaid insurance is only $7,000, the accountant will say that the reported amount of prepaid insurance is overstated by $1,000.
Because of double-entry accounting, if the balance in the account Prepaid Insurance is overstated (too much is being reported) it is likely that the account Insurance Expense will be understated (too little is being reported).",what
What is accrued payroll?,"Definition of Accrued Payroll
Accrued payroll includes wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses, and other payroll related expenses that have been earned by a company's employees, but have not yet been paid or recorded in the company's general ledger accounts.
Example of Accrued Payroll
Let's assume that a retailer's hourly-paid employees are paid each Friday for the hours they worked during the previous week. Let's also assume that as of December 31, the hours worked from December 27 through December 31 will be part of the payroll that will be processed in early January and paid to the employees on Friday, January 8. The amount of the wages for the five days of December 27 through December 31 are calculated to be $5,000. In addition, the retailer incurred payroll taxes and fringe benefits amounting to $1,000. Therefore, the total amount of accrued payroll is $6,000.
Under the accrual basis of accounting, the retailer must report the $6,500 of accrued payroll as:

An expense on its income statement for the period ended December 31
Current liability on its balance sheet as of December 31

The retailer will accomplish this by preparing an accrual adjusting entry dated as of December 31.",what
Are payroll withholding taxes an expense or a liability?,"Definition of Payroll Withholding Taxes
Payroll withholding taxes are amounts withheld from employees' wages and salaries. The amounts withheld are actually the employees' money that the employer is required by law to withhold and remit to the government. In other words, the employer is acting as an agent by withholding and remitting the employees' money.
Examples of Payroll Withholding Taxes
The payroll taxes withheld from employees include federal income taxes, state income taxes, and the employees' portion of the FICA or Social Security and Medicare taxes.
Payroll Withholdings are Liabilities
The payroll taxes withheld from employees are a current liability of the employer until the amounts are remitted to the governments. (The taxes withheld from employees are not an expense of the company that withheld them.) 
The payroll taxes that are not withheld from employees are expenses of the employer and are liabilities until the amounts are remitted. Examples include the employer's portion of the FICA tax and unemployment taxes.",what
What is a T-account?,"Definition of T-Account
A T-account is a visual aid used to depict a general ledger account. The account title is written above the horizontal part of the ""T"". On the left-side of the vertical line, the debit amounts are shown. On the right-side the credit amounts are shown.
Examples for Using T-Accounts
I regularly use T-accounts when preparing adjusting entries (accruals and deferrals). I begin by drawing two T-accounts, marking one as the balance sheet account, and one as the income statement account. I then enter the current balances. The next step is to determine the amount that should be the correct ending balance for the balance sheet account. The difference between the current balance and the needed ending balance is the amount for the adjusting entry.
As a young accountant I had to determine the effect of a new FASB standard on my employer's financial statements. I reported on the impact on the company's expenses in great detail. I thought I was done until the controller drew two T-accounts on a piece of paper and noted my comments in the expense T-account, and then asked, ""What about the other account? You told me about the expense account, but what other account or accounts are involved? You know we have double-entry accounting!"" Thanks to his two T-accounts, I have never forgotten to consider the full impact of business transactions.",what
What is an account payable?,"Definition of an Account Payable
An account payable is an amount owed to a supplier or vendor for goods or services that were provided in advance of payment. However, some people use the term only if the amount is already recorded in the general ledger account Accounts Payable. (Until it is, they refer to the amount as one of the company's accrued liabilities.) For others, it is an account payable even if it is not yet recorded in Accounts Payable.
Example of an Account Payable
Assume that a corporation received repair services from Joe's Plumbing LLC on August 29. On August 31 the corporation receives an invoice from Joe's for $900. The invoice states that the $900 is due within 30 days. After reviewing and approving the invoice, the corporation enters Joe's invoice into its accounting records with a credit to Accounts Payable and debit to Repairs and Maintenance Expense.
Until the invoice from Joe's Plumbing Service is paid, Joe's invoice serves as a supporting document for the balance in the corporation's Accounts Payable. (The invoice is also a supporting document for the balance in Joe's Accounts Receivable.)",what
Is sales tax an expense or a liability?,"Definition of Sales Tax
In the U.S., a sales tax is a state tax (and possibly an additional local tax) that is paid by the buyer at the time of purchase. The amount of the sales tax is based on the product and the sales tax rate. For instance, in some states unprepared grocery items are not subject to a sales tax. Items purchased for resale are not subject to the sales tax when purchased by the retailer, but will be subject to the sales tax when the items are sold to the end customer. In some cities, there could be a state sales tax of 6% plus a county tax of 1% and a tourist district sales tax of 3%. In another state there could be only a sales tax rate of 8%.
The sales taxes collected by a merchant are not part of the merchant's sales and are not part of the merchant's expenses. Instead, the merchant is merely an agent of the state and will record the sales taxes collected as a current liability. When the merchant remits the sales taxes to the state, the current liability account is reduced. 
If a company purchases a new delivery van, the sales taxes paid on the van are recorded as part of the cost of the van. The total cost of the van will then be charged to depreciation expense over the van's useful life.
Examples of Sales Tax
If a company sells $100,000 of merchandise that is subject to a state sales tax of 7%, the company will collect $107,000. The journal entry to record this information is:

Debit Cash for $107,000
Credit Sales (or Sales Revenues) for $100,000
Credit Sales Taxes Payable for $7,000

When the company remits the $7,000 to the state, the company will credit Cash and debit Sales Taxes Payable. Note that in this example that the sales tax is not an expense and it is not part of the company's sales revenues.
If a company purchases a new delivery van for $50,000 plus $3,500 of sales tax, the company will record the truck as an asset at its total cost of $53,500. In this situation, the sales tax of $3,500 is considered to be a necessary cost of the truck and will be part of the depreciation expense recorded during the useful life of the truck.",what
How does an expense affect the balance sheet?,"Definition of Expense
An expense is a cost that has been used up, expired, or is directly related to the earning of revenues.
Most of a company's expenses fall into the following categories:

cost of goods sold
sales, general and administrative expenses
interest expense

How an Expense Affects the Balance Sheet
An expense will decrease a corporation's retained earnings (which is part of stockholders' equity) or will decrease a sole proprietor's capital account (which is part of owner's equity).
In addition to affecting retained earnings or the owner's capital account, an expense will also cause one or more of the following changes to the balance sheet:

A decrease in Cash, Prepaid Expenses, Supplies on Hand, Inventory
An increase in the credit balance in the contra-asset account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts or Accumulated Depreciation
An increase in the balance in the liability account Accounts Payable, or an increase in Accrued Expenses Payable (including Wages Payable, Interest Payable, etc.)",what
Why is income received in advance a liability?,"Definition of Income Received in Advance
Under the accrual method of accounting, when a company receives money from a customer prior to earning it, the company will have to make the following entry:

Debit Cash
Credit a liability account such as Deferred Revenue, Deferred Income, Unearned Revenue

The credit to the liability account is made because the company has not yet earned the money and the company has an obligation to deliver the goods or services (or to return the money) to the customer. Accountants will state that the company is deferring the revenue until it is earned. Once the money is earned, the liability will be decreased and a revenue account will be increased.
Example of Income Received in Advance
Assume that Jones Corporation received $10,000 from a customer on December 31 for work that will be done in the following month. On December 31, Jones Corporation will debit Cash for $10,000 and will credit Deferred Revenue for $10,000. Therefore, Jones Corporation's December 31 balance sheet's Cash will include the $10,000 and its current liabilities will report Deferred Revenue of $10,000.
After Jones Corporation delivers the goods or services, it will debit Deferred Revenue for $10,000 and will credit Sales Revenues or Service Revenues for $10,000.",what
How do you record the interest that is unpaid on a note payable?,"Definition of Interest Unpaid on Note Payable
Interest that has occurred, but has not been paid as of a balance sheet date, is referred to as accrued interest.
Under the accrual basis of accounting, the amount that has occurred but is unpaid should be recorded with a debit to Interest Expense and a credit to the current liability Interest Payable.
Example of Recording Unpaid Interest
Let's assume that on December 10, a company made its monthly payment on a loan and the payment included interest through December 10. On the company's financial statements dated December 31, the company will need to report the interest expense and liability for December 11 through 31. This is done with an accrual adjusting entry dated December 31. If the interest for December 11 through December 31 was $100, the adjusting entry dated December 31 will debit Interest Expense for $100, and will credit Interest Payable for $100.",what
What is carriage inwards?,"Definition of Carriage Inwards
Carriage inwards refers to the transportation costs required to be paid by the purchaser when it receives merchandise it ordered with terms FOB shipping point. Carriage inwards is also known as freight-in or transportation-in.
Carriage inwards is considered to be part of the cost of the items purchased. Hence, for inventory items carriage inwards will be part of the cost of the goods available, the cost of inventory, and the cost of goods sold.
Example of Carriage Inwards
Assume that a company uses the periodic inventory method and it purchases goods with terms FOB shipping point. As a result the company is responsible for paying the cost of the carriage inwards. The company will record the amount in the general ledger account Carriage Inwards (or Freight-in or Transportation-in). The carriage inwards costs are considered to be part of the cost of items purchased, since an asset's cost is defined as all costs that are necessary to get the asset in place and ready for use.",what
What is a reclassification?,"Definition of Reclassification
In accounting, the term reclassification is often used to describe moving an amount from one general ledger account to another. 
Examples of Reclassification
Assume that a repair bill of $5,000 was initially debited to the asset account Equipment. Since the repair was not an improvement nor did it extend the life of the equipment, the controller prepared a journal entry that debits Repairs Expense for $5,000 and credits Equipment for $5,000. The description on the controller's journal entry was, ""To reclassify the XYZ Co.'s repair bill from Equipment to Repairs Expense.""
Reclassification can also be used to describe moving a note payable from a long-term liability account to a short-term or current liability account when the note's maturity date is less than one year away.
Another example of reclassification arises when a company stops using one of its buildings and puts the building up for sale. In that situation, the journal entry description might be, ""To reclassify the X building from property, plant and equipment to long-term investments.""",what
Where do credit card payments get recorded?,"Definition of Credit Card Payments
We define a credit card payment as the amount a company remits to the credit card company for the purchases that occurred by using the credit card.
The company's payment to the credit card company will result in a credit to the company's Cash account. However, the debit portion of the payment entry depends on whether the individual credit card purchases had been previously recorded in the company's general ledger accounts.
Example of Recording Credit Card Payments
Assuming that the credit card purchases had not been previously entered into the accounts, there will be many debits in order to record each of the many credit card purchases/transactions into the company's appropriate general ledger account(s).
Assuming that the credit card purchases were recorded in the general ledger accounts prior to the company paying the credit card bill, the payment to the credit card company might be recorded with a credit to Cash and a single debit to Credit Card Payable (if that account was used when recording the credit card purchases).",what
What is a purchase discount?,"Definition of Purchase Discount
A purchase discount is a deduction that a company may receive if the supplier offers it and the company pays the supplier's invoice within a specified period of time. The purchase discount is also known as a cash discount or early-payment discount. (A supplier offering the discount will record the discounts taken by its customers in the account Sales Discounts.)
Purchase Discounts is also a general ledger account used by a company purchasing inventory goods and accounting for them under the periodic inventory system.
Example of Purchase Discount
Assume that a company receives a supplier's invoice of $5,000 with the credit terms 2/10 net 30. The company will be allowed to subtract a purchase discount of $100 (2% of $5,000) and remit $4,900 if the invoice is paid in 10 days. Otherwise, the company must pay the full $5,000 within 30 days.
If a company purchases office equipment for $20,000 and the invoice has credit terms of 1/10, net 30, the company can deduct $200 (1% of $20,000) and remit $19,800 if the invoice is paid within 10 days. If that occurs, the company will record the equipment at its cost of $19,800.",what
Where is accrued income reported in the balance sheet?,"Definition of Accrued Income
Accrued income refers to amounts that have been earned, but the amounts have not yet been received. For example, a corporation may have its excess cash invested in an investment security that pays interest every six months. Between the interest payment dates, the company will have:

Accrued interest income that is to be reported on the income statement
Accrued interest receivable that is to be reported on the balance sheet

Accrued Income Reported on the Balance Sheet
The amount of accrued income that a corporation has a right to receive as of the date of the balance sheet will be reported in the current asset section of the balance sheet. It could be described as accrued receivables or accrued income.
The amount of the accrued income reported on the income statement also causes an increase in a corporation's retained earnings, which is part of the stockholders' equity section of the balance sheet.
Balance Sheet: Retail/Wholesale - Corporation",what
What is the entry for a loan to an employee?,"Definition of Loan to Employee
A loan to an employee is money advanced by the company to assist the employee. If the employee is expected to repay the loan within one year of the balance sheet date, the loan balance is a current asset of the company. Any amount not expected to be collected within one year is a noncurrent or long term asset.
It is common for the loan to an employee to specify an interest rate and a schedule of payments.
Entry to Record a Loan to Employee
Assume that a company lends an employee $5,000 for a family emergency. The entry will debit Loan to Employee for $5,000 and will credit Cash for $5,000.
Under the accrual method of accounting, at each balance sheet date the company should record any accrued interest by debiting Interest Receivable and crediting Interest Income.
When the employee makes a payment, the company will debit Cash and will credit Interest Receivable and Loan to Employee for the appropriate amounts.",what
How should the sale of gift certificates be recorded in the general ledger?,"Definition of Gift Certificates
Gift certificates (and gift cards) are often sold by a retailer to a buyer for cash. The buyer can then redeem the gift certificate or give it to another person who can redeem the gift certificate for merchandise or services.
Accounting for the Sale of Gift Certificates
The sale of a gift certificate should be recorded with a debit to Cash and a credit to a liability account such as Gift Certificates Outstanding.
Note that revenue is not recorded at this point. Rather, the retailer is recording its obligation/liability to provide merchandise or services for the amount of the certificate sold.
Accounting for the Redemption of a Gift Certificate
When a gift certificate is presented to the retailer, revenue will be recorded by the retailer for the amount of merchandise or services that were provided. This is done with a debit to the liability account Gift Certificates Outstanding and a credit to a revenue account.
Our explanation pertains to financial accounting. To learn about the income tax treatment of this transaction, you should seek advice from a tax professional or go to www.irs.gov.",what
What is insurance expense?,"Definition of Insurance Expense
Under the accrual basis of accounting, insurance expense is the cost of insurance that has been incurred, has expired, or has been used up during the current accounting period for the nonmanufacturing functions of a business.
A manufacturer will report on its income statement the insurance expense incurred for its selling, general and administrative functions. However, the insurance costs associated with the manufacturing function are included in the cost of the current period's output. Any prepaid insurance costs are to be reported as a current asset.
Example of Insurance Expense
Let's assume that a retailer has insurance policies for its property, general liability, vehicles, and employees' worker compensation, medical, dental, life, and disability. The company pays the premiums on the various insurance policies in advance. Any insurance premium costs that have not expired as of the balance sheet date should be reported as a current asset such as Prepaid Insurance. The costs that have expired should be reported in income statement accounts such as Insurance Expense, Fringe Benefits Expense, etc. Here's a recap for the cost of insurance at the retailer:

Expired insurance premiums are reported as Insurance Expense.
Unexpired insurance premiums are reported as Prepaid Insurance (an asset account).

If the retailer has incurred some insurance expense but has not yet paid the premiums, the retailer should debit Insurance Expense and credit Insurance Premiums Payable.",what
Are the goods purchased by a retailer an expense or an asset?,"Definition of Goods Purchased by a Retailer
The goods purchased by a retailer are the products or merchandise that it buys and plans to resell.
The goods that are sold during the accounting period must be reported on the retailer's income statement as the cost of goods sold. 
The goods that are unsold at the end of the accounting period must be reported on the retailer's balance sheet as inventory.
Accounting for the Goods Purchased
There are two ways to record the goods at the time the goods are purchased:

Their cost could be recorded in an expense account (such as Cost of Goods Sold)
Their cost could be recorded in an asset account (such as Inventory)

Either way, the Inventory account must be adjusted to the actual amount. The other part of the adjusting entry is recorded in the income statement account.
Examples of Accounting for Goods Purchased
Assume that a retailer begins the year with inventory having a cost of $800. It ends the year with inventory having a cost of $900. During the year the retailer purchased goods at a cost of $7,000. Let's also assume that the cost per unit did not change during the year.
If the retailer records the $7,000 of purchases as an expense (cost of goods sold), then at the end of the year the retailer's adjusting entry must debit Inventory for $100 (since the inventory has increased from $800 to $900). The other account in this adjusting entry is the expense Cost of Goods Sold which is credited for $100. As a result, the income statement will report the cost of goods sold at $6,900 ($7,000 minus the $100 credit). The balance sheet will report inventory of $900 ($800 plus the debit of $100).
If the retailer records the $7,000 of purchases as an asset, the Inventory account balance increases from $800 to $7,800. Since the actual inventory at the end of the year is $900, the adjusting entry must credit Inventory for $6,900 ($7,800 minus $900) and debit Cost of Goods Sold for $6,900.
Regardless of whether the goods purchased were initially recorded as an expense or as an asset, the amounts must be adjusted so that the financial statements report the expense (reported as the cost of goods sold on the income statement for the year) at $6,900 and the asset inventory (reported on the balance sheet as of the end of the year) at $900.",what
What is the difference between paid-in capital and retained earnings?,"Definition of Paid-in Capital
Paid-in capital is one of the major categories of stockholders' equity. Generally, paid-in capital reports the amount that a corporation received from its stockholders (or shareholders) in exchange for the newly issued shares of its capital stock. 
Paid-in capital is also referred to as contributed capital and as permanent capital.
Definition of Retained Earnings
Generally, retained earnings is the cumulative amount of after-tax net income earned by the corporation since its inception minus the dividends that have been distributed to its stockholders since the corporation began.",what
What is a customer deposit?,"Definition of Customer Deposit
A customer deposit could be money that a company receives from a customer prior to the company earning it (by providing the customer with goods or services). In other words, the company receives the asset Cash and has an obligation to provide the goods or services to the customer or to return the money. Hence, the current liability account Customer Deposits is credited. When the company earns the deposit amount, the current liability will be debited and Sales Revenues will be credited.
A customer deposit could also refer to the money a bank receives from a depositor. Since the bank is not earning this money, the amount is recorded by the bank with a debit to Cash and a credit to Customer Deposits.
Example of Customer Deposit
Let's assume that Ace Manufacturing Inc. agrees to produce an expensive, custom-made machine for one of its customers. Ace requires that the customer pay $50,000 before Ace begins to design and construct the machine. The $50,000 payment is made in December 2018 and the machine must be finished by March 31, 2019. The $50,000 is a down payment toward the machine's price of $400,000.
In December 2018 Ace will debit Cash for $50,000 and will credit Customer Deposits, a current liability account. When the machine is completed in 2019, Ace will debit Customer Deposits for $50,000 and will credit Sales Revenues for $50,000.",what
What is an unpresented cheque or check and does it require an adjustment to the balance sheet?,"Definition of Unpresented Cheque or Check
An unpresented cheque is a check that a company has written, but the check has not yet been paid by the bank on which it is drawn. An unpresented check is also referred to as an outstanding check or a check that has not yet cleared the bank.
In the bank reconciliation, the unpresented or outstanding check is deducted from the balance per the bank in order to arrive at the adjusted or corrected balance per bank.
Effect of Unpresented Check on Balance Sheet
When a company writes a check, the company records it with a credit to the Cash account in the company's general ledger. Whether the check has or hasn't cleared the bank account, the company's Cash account balance is proper. Hence, the company's general ledger Cash account will not require an adjustment for the unpresented or outstanding check when it is reported on the balance sheet.",what
Is the installation labor for a new asset expensed or included in the cost of the asset?,"Accounting for Labor to Install Asset
The definition of an asset's cost is all costs that are necessary to get an asset in place and ready for use. Therefore, the cost of the installation labor (wages and related fringe benefits) is part of the cost of the asset (and not an immediate expense of the accounting period).
The total cost of the asset, including installation costs, will become an expense when the asset depreciated over the asset's useful life.",what
What is the difference between an unadjusted trial balance and an adjusted trial balance?,"Difference between Unadjusted Trial Balance and Adjusted Trial Balance
The differences between an unadjusted trial balance and an adjusted trial balance are the amounts in the adjusting entries.
Examples of Adjusting Entries
Adjusting entries that will result in a difference between the unadjusted trial balance and the adjusted trial balance include the following:

The accrual of expenses that were incurred but were not yet recorded
The accrual of revenues that were earned but were not yet recorded
The deferral of a payment to the balance sheet until it becomes an expense in a future accounting period
The deferral of a receipt to the balance sheet until it is earned in a future accounting period
Adjustments to previous recorded deferrals that now belong on the income statement",what
How do you record an asset that was partially financed?,"Example of Recording an Asset that was Partially Financed
Assume that your company purchased a car for $10,000 by paying cash of $4,000 and signing a promissory note for $6,000.
The accounting entry is:

Debit the asset account Automobiles for the cost of $10,000
Credit the asset account Cash for the $4,000 that was paid
Credit the liability account Notes Payable for $6,000

The liability account Notes Payable reports the principal amount owed at the time. Interest that will occur in the future is not recorded at the time of the purchase. The reason is that the interest is not owed as of that date.
Each month, one month's interest on the note or loan should be recorded with a debit to Interest Expense and a credit to Cash or Interest Payable (if the interest was not paid). Any cash payments that exceed the amount of interest owed at the time of the payment should be debited to Notes Payable. The balance in the liability account Notes Payable should agree with the principal balance owed to the lender. The balance in the liability account Interest Payable should agree with the interest due as of that date.
You can call the lender to verify the amount of principal and interest owed at a specific date and then compare the amounts to the balances in your general ledger accounts.",what

The self-employed person's FICA tax rate for 2019 (January 1 through December 31, 2019) is 15.3% on the first $132,900 of net income plus 2.9% on the net income in excess of $132,900. In other words, the self-employed person's FICA tax rate for 2019 includes all of the following:

 the employee's portion of the Social Security tax, which is 6.2% of the first $132,900 of net income
 the employer's portion of the Social Security tax, which is 6.2% of the first $132,900 of net income
 the employee's portion of the Medicare tax, which is 1.45% of all net income (no cap or limit on net income)
 the employer's portion of the Medicare tax, which is 1.45% of all net income (no cap or limit on net income)

A self-employed person having net income of exactly $132,900 in 2019 must remit FICA taxes of $20,333.70 ($132,900 X 15.3%).
2020 FICA Tax Rate for Self-Employed
The self-employed person's FICA tax rate for 2020 (January 1 through December 31, 2020) is 15.3% on the first $137,700 of net income plus 2.9% on the net income in excess of $137,700. In other words, the self-employed person's FICA tax rate for 2020 includes all of the following:

 the employer's portion of the Medicare tax, which is 1.45% of all net income (no cap or limit on net income)

A self-employed person having net income of exactly $137,700 in 2020 must remit FICA taxes of $21,068.10 ($137,700 X 15.3%).
There is also an Additional Medicare Tax that applies to higher income taxpayers. Information on the Medicare surtax and other income tax information can be found at www.irs.gov.",what
What does a bookkeeper do?,"Definition of Bookkeeper
A bookkeeper's role at a company varies by the size and nature of the business. At a very small company without an accountant, the bookkeeper's duties are likely to be extensive. At a minimum, the bookkeeper is responsible for processing the paperwork for a company's transactions and getting the information quickly and accurately recorded in the company's general ledger accounts. Today, this is done best through the use of cost effective software such as QuickBooks from Intuit.
A bookkeeper's work is often reviewed by an accountant and/or the small business owner. 
The qualifications of a bookkeeper include business sense, attention to detail, speed, accuracy, ability to adapt to changes in technology, understanding of debits and credits, and a general understanding of financial statements.
Things that Bookkeepers Do
At small companies bookkeepers may be involved in the following activities:

Processing vendors' invoices
Billing and following up on accounts receivable
Payroll processing
Managing cash
Reconciling account balances
Perhaps preparing and processing adjusting entries",what
What is an accounting period?,"Definition of Accounting Period
An accounting period is the period of time covered by a company's financial statements. Common accounting periods for external financial statements include the calendar year (January 1 through December 31) and the calendar quarter (January 1 through March 31, April 1 through June 30, July 1 through September 30, October 1 through December 31). It is common for these companies to also have monthly accounting periods. However, the financial statements for the monthly accounting periods are likely to be used only by the companies' managements.
In the U.S., some companies have annual accounting periods that end on dates other than December 31. For example, a company could have a fiscal year of July 1 through the following June 30. Its quarterly accounting periods would be July 1 through September 30, etc.
It is also common for U.S. retailers to have accounting periods that end on a Saturday. The annual accounting period for these businesses may be the 52- or 53-week fiscal years ending on the Saturday closest to February 1 or any other date. The retailers' quarterly accounting periods will be the 13-week periods, and the monthly accounting periods will be a 4- or 5-week time period. 
Examples of Accounting Periods
The following are some examples of accounting periods used by U.S. companies:

Annual calendar year of January 1 through December 31
Annual fiscal year such as July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020; April 1, 2019 through March 31, 2020; etc.
52- or 53-week fiscal year such as the 52 or 53 weeks ending on the last Saturday of January, etc.
Calendar quarters such as January 1 through March 31, April 1 through June 30, etc.

Fiscal quarters such as May 1 through July 31, August 1 through October 31, etc.
13-week fiscal quarters such as the 13 weeks ending on the last Saturday in April, etc.
Calendar months such as March 1 through March 31, November 1 through November 30, etc.
4- or 5-week fiscal months such as the 4 weeks ending the last Saturday of February, etc.",what
What is the difference between adjusting entries and closing entries?,"Definition of Adjusting Entries
Adjusting entries are made at the end of the accounting period (but prior to preparing the financial statements) in order for a company's financial statements to be up-to-date on the accrual basis of accounting.
Examples of Adjusting Entries
The following are hypothetical examples of adjusting entries:

Each day the company incurs wages expense for its hourly-paid employees. However, the payroll that includes the workers' wages for the last few days of the month won't be recorded until after the accounting period ends. Therefore, the company must prepare an adjusting entry dated for the last day of the month that debits Wages Expense and credits Wages Payable for the labor used and the amount owed.
Similarly, the company uses electricity each day but receives only one bill per month, perhaps on the 20th day of the month (for electricity used through the 15th day of the month). The cost of the electricity used during the last half of the month must get into the accounting records through an adjusting entry for the financial statements to show all of the expenses for the month and all of the liabilities as of the end of the month.
Another adjusting entry records the depreciation of assets used in the business. Every month the company must prepare an adjusting entry that debits Depreciation Expense and credits Accumulated Depreciation to report the month's depreciation.

Definition of Closing Entries
Closing entries are dated as of the last day of the accounting period, but are entered into the accounts after the financial statements are prepared. Closing entries involve the temporary accounts (the majority of which are the income statement accounts).
Example of Closing Entries
The closing entries will transfer all of the year-end balances from the revenue accounts and the expense accounts to a corporation's retained earnings account or a sole proprietorship's owner's equity account. With today's accounting software, the closing entries are effortless.",what
Why are assets and expenses increased with a debit?,"Let's use two transactions to illustrate why assets and expenses are increased with a debit: 1) A company pays $25,000 for a new delivery van, and 2) A company pays $800 for the current month's rent.
In both of the transactions the company pays cash at the time of the transaction. In each of the transactions the Cash account is credited. Therefore, each transaction will require a debit to another account. (Recall that double-entry bookkeeping requires at least one debit and one credit when recording a transaction.)
In the first transaction, the debit will be to a long term asset account such as Delivery Vehicles. In this transaction the asset Delivery Vehicles was increased with a debit and the asset Cash was decreased with a credit. The accounting equation (A=L+OE) remains in balance because one asset increased by $25,000 and one asset decreased by $25,000.
In the second transaction, the debit will be to Rent Expense since the amount will be used up in the current accounting period. (If the amount was a prepayment of a future period's rent, the amount would have been debited to the asset account Prepaid Rent.) Since Rent Expense reduces net income, it  also reduces owner's or stockholders' equity, which normally have credit balances. The accounting equation will show assets decreasing by the reduction in cash and owner's or stockholders' equity decreasing because of the expense.
The asset Delivery Vehicle is an asset, but will become Depreciation Expense over the life of the vehicle. The rent is an immediate expense because there is no future accounting period benefiting from the current month's rent.",what
What does it mean to replenish the petty cash fund?,"Definition of Replenishing Petty Cash
Replenishing the petty cash fund means the petty cash custodian requests and receives cash from the company's regular checking account in an amount that will return the cash on hand to the amount shown in the general ledger account Petty Cash.
Example of Replenishing Petty Cash
Let's assume that a company has a petty cash fund of $100 and its general ledger account Petty Cash has a debit balance of $100. Mary is the petty cash custodian who is the only person handling the petty cash transactions. At all times Mary should have some combination of cash and petty cash vouchers (receipts) that are equal to $100.
Next, let's assume that there is only $20.00 in cash remaining and Mary realizes that $20 is not sufficient. She needs to obtain a company check for $80 in order to cash it and return the cash amount to $100 (the amount shown in the Petty Cash account). The petty cash vouchers provide the documentation for the $80 check request. In the process Mary discovers that the vouchers add up to only $79. Mary will debit the accounts indicated on the petty cash vouchers and then debit Cash Short and Over for $1 (the amount that is not accounted for). 
It is important to realize that the $80 check will be credited to Cash (the company's checking account). There is no entry to the Petty Cash account when merely replenishing the petty cash.",what
What is the difference between revenues and receipts?,"Definition of Revenues
A company's revenues are amounts it has earned as the result of business activities such as selling merchandise or performing services. Under the accrual method of accounting, revenues are reported on the income statement in the period in which they are earned even though the dependable customers will pay the company 30 days later.
Example of Revenues
On June 10, a company sells $4,000 of goods to one of its best customers with credit terms of net 30 days. On June 10, the company has revenues of $4,000 which will be recorded with a debit of $4,000 to Accounts Receivable and a credit of $4,000 to Sales Revenues. 
Definition of Receipts
A company's receipts  refers to the cash that the company received.
Examples of Receipts
The following are some examples of receipts which are not revenues:

Borrowing $1,000 in cash from the bank
Collecting $4,000 from a sale that was recorded one month earlier
Disposing of a company vehicle and receiving cash that is equal to the vehicle's book value
Receiving $1,000 from an employee who had borrowed $1,000 from the company several weeks earlier
Receiving cash from an investor for new shares of the company's common stock

Example of Both a Revenue and a Receipt
When a company makes a $200 cash sale (or performs services for $200 of cash) the company has earned revenue of $200 and has a receipt of $200.",what
What is the difference between entries in a general journal versus a general ledger?,"Definition of General Journal
The general journal is described as the book of original entry. Today the general journal is used to record adjusting entries and transactions other than payments, receipts, or payroll. An entry in the general journal will include the date, the account with the amount that is to be debited, the account with the amount that is to be credited, and a brief description. After these relatively few transactions are recorded in the general journal, the amounts will be posted to the accounts indicated.
Definition of General Ledger
The general ledger contains the accounts used by the company to sort and store the amounts from all of the company's transactions (including all of the payments, receipts, payroll, and general journal entries). These accounts are known as general ledger accounts. The amounts and balances in the general ledger accounts are used to prepare the company's financial statements. 
Example of General Journal and General Ledger
Assume that a company depreciates its equipment at a rate of $10,000 per year.
In the general journal the company enters the following information:

December 31 (and the year)
Depreciation Expense $10,000 (in the debit column)
Accumulated Depreciation $10,000 (in the credit column)
A short explanation such as ""Depreciation for the Year""

Next, the amounts in the general journal must be posted to the specified accounts in the general ledger. In our example, the account Depreciation Expense will be debited as of December 31 for $10,000 and the account Accumulated Depreciation will be credited as of December 31 for $10,000.",what
Is advertising an asset or an expense?,"Definition of Advertising Expense
Advertising is the amount a company incurs to promote its products, brands, and image via television, radio, magazines, Internet, etc. Since the accountants cannot measure the future benefit of the advertising, the advertising costs must be reported as Advertising Expense at the time the ads are run.
A prepayment of the cost of ads that will air in the future should be recorded in a current asset account such as Prepaid Advertising. When the ad is aired, the amount must be transferred from Prepaid Advertising to Advertising Expense.
Example of Advertising as an Asset and as an Expense
Let's assume that in December a corporation paid $15 million to prepare an ad and to book a time for it to be shown during the Super Bowl Game in early February. Until February, the $15 million is the current asset Prepaid Advertising. After the ad is shown in the Super Bowl Game, the corporation must credit Prepaid Advertising and debit Advertising Expense. This is necessary because the accountants cannot measure the sales (if any) that will occur because of the Super Bowl ad.",what
What are debits and credits?,"Definition of Debits and Credits
Debits and credits are terms used in accounting and bookkeeping systems for the past five centuries. They are part of the double entry system which results in every business transaction affecting at least two accounts. At least one of the accounts will receive a debit entry and at least one other account will receive a credit entry. Further, the amounts entered as debits must be equal to the amounts entered as credits.
You should think of a debit as an entry on the left side of an account, and a credit as an entry on the right side of another account. Accountants often use T-accounts to visualize the debit and credit effects on the accounts' balances.
It may take some time to learn which general ledger accounts will be debited and credited, but here are some general rules:

Expense accounts generally have debit entries and have debit balances
Revenue accounts generally have credit entries and have credit balances
Assets generally have both debit and credit entries, but usually have debit balances
Liabilities generally have debit and credit entries, but usually have credit balances
Stockholders' equity accounts could have debit and credit entries, but profitable corporations usually have credit balances

Examples of Debits and Credits
To illustrate, let's assume that a company borrows $10,000 from its bank. The company will enter $10,000 as a debit in its Cash account and a credit of $10,000 in its Notes Payable account.
If the company pays $300 for an ad to air on the radio, the company will enter $300 as a debit in the Advertising Expense account and will enter $300 as a credit in its Cash account.",what
What is a liability account?,"A liability account is a general ledger account in which a company records its debt, obligations, customer deposits and customer prepayments, certain deferred income taxes, etc. that are the result of a past transaction. Common liability accounts under the accrual method of accounting include Accounts Payable, Accrued Liabilities (amounts owed but not yet recorded in Accounts Payable), Notes Payable, Unearned Revenues, Deferred Income Taxes (certain temporary timing differences), etc.
The balances in liability accounts are nearly always credit balances and will be reported on the balance sheet as either current liabilities or noncurrent (or long-term) liabilities.
The company with the liability account for the debt or payables is known as the debtor. The lenders, vendors, suppliers, employees, tax agencies, etc. who are owed the money are known as the company's creditors.",what
Why are accruals needed every month?,"Reasons for Monthly Accruals
Accrual adjusting entries are needed monthly only if a company issues monthly financial statements.
Two reasons for the monthly accrual adjusting entries are:

To report the revenues and the related receivables which were earned during the month, but the transactions had not been recorded in the accounts as of the end of the month
To record the expenses, losses, and their related liabilities which were incurred during the month, but the transactions had not been recorded in the accounts as of the end of the month

Monthly accruals and deferrals and other adjusting entries must be recorded prior to issuing monthly financial statements in order to comply with the accrual basis of accounting.",what
Why would a balance sheet list current liabilities as negative amounts?,"Reasons for Negative Current Liabilities on a Balance Sheet
Some older accounting software used minus signs or parentheses to indicate credit balances, while positive numbers indicated debit balances. The accounting software usually had an option to print the liability account balances on the balance sheet without the negative signs.
If only one liability account has a negative sign, it is likely that the liability account has a debit balance instead of the normal credit balance. This would be the case if a company remitted more than the amount needed. 
During the first few days of the accounting period in which reversing entries are recorded to reverse the accrual adjusting entries for expenses and liabilities of the previous period, the current liability accounts will show debit balances. However, that is a temporary situation until the actual bills are processed.",what
Are sales discounts reported as an expense?,"Definition of Sales Discounts
Sales discounts are also known as cash discounts or early payment discounts. Sales discounts (along with sales returns and allowances) are deducted from gross sales to arrive at the company's net sales. Hence, the general ledger account Sales Discounts is a contra revenue account. Sales discounts are not reported as an expense.
Example of Sales Discounts
A company offers its business customer sales discounts of 1/10, net 30. For the recent year, the company had gross sales of $510,000 and had sales discounts of $4,000 and sales returns and allowance of $5,000. As a result, the company reported net sales of $501,000.",what
What is a classified balance sheet?,"A classified balance sheet is one that arranges the balance sheet accounts into a format that is useful for the readers. For example, most balance sheets use the following asset classifications:

current
long-term investments
property, plant and equipment
intangible assets
other assets

Liabilities are usually classified as:

current, or
noncurrent or long-term liabilities",what
What are the two methods for recording prepaid expenses?,"Definition of Prepaid Expenses
Prepaid expenses refers to payments made in advance and part of the amount will become an expense in a future accounting period. A common example is paying a 6-month insurance premium in December that provides coverage from December 1 through May 31. 
Examples of Two Methods for Recording Prepaid Expenses
One method for recording a prepaid expense is to record the entire payment in an asset account. For example, assume that on December 1 a company pays an insurance premium of $2,400 for 6 months of liability insurance coverage:

On December 1 the company debits Prepaid Insurance for $2,400 and credits Cash for $2,400
On the last day of December and on the last day of the following 5 months the company needs to record an adjusting entry that debits Insurance Expense for $400 ($2,400 divided by 6 months) and credits Prepaid Insurance for $400

A second method of recording a prepaid expense is to record the entire payment in the expense account. Using the information above, the following entries will occur:

On December 1 the company debits Insurance Expense for $2,400 and credits Cash for $2,400
On the last day of December the company records an adjusting entry that debits the asset account Prepaid Insurance for $2,000 ($2,400 divided by 6 months times the 5 months that will be prepaid as of December 31) and credits Insurance Expense for $2,000
At the end of each of the following 5 months the adjusting entry will debit Insurance Expense for $400 and will credit Prepaid Insurance for $400

Either method for recording prepaid expenses could be used as long as the asset account balance is equal to the unexpired or unused cost as of each balance sheet date.",what
Is there a difference between the accounts Purchases and Inventory?,"Purchases Account Under the Periodic Inventory System
The general ledger account Purchases is used to record the purchases of inventory items under the periodic inventory system. Under the periodic system the account Inventory will have no entries until it is adjusted at the end of the accounting year so that it reports the cost of the ending inventory.
Under the periodic system, the cost in the account Purchases will be added to the cost of the beginning inventory to arrive at the cost of goods available. The cost of the ending inventory is computed through a physical count (or an estimate) and is subtracted from the cost of goods available to arrive at the cost of goods sold.
Inventory Account Under the Perpetual Inventory System
The account Purchases is nonexistent with the perpetual inventory system. Under the perpetual inventory system, the cost of inventory items purchased are recorded directly into the account Inventory.
Under the perpetual system, the costs of the goods sold are removed from the account Inventory when the goods are sold and are recorded in the account Cost of Goods Sold. As a result, the balance in the account Inventory should be the cost of the ending inventory.",what
Does sales commission get reported in the income statement?,"Sales commissions earned by a company would be reported as revenue in the company's income statement. Sales commissions that a company must pay to others are reported as an expense.
Under the accrual basis of accounting (as opposed to the cash basis) commission revenues should be reported when the company earns the commissions. The commission expense should be reported when the company has incurred the expense and liability. (This would also be the time when the other party has earned the commissions and the right to receive them.)
The commission revenues would be reported as operating revenue (in the section where sales are reported), if the commissions are earned as a main activity of the company. If the commissions are incidental or involve a peripheral activity, these commission revenues would be reported as other income.
Commission expense would be reported as a selling expense along with other operating expenses when they are related to the company's main activities. If a commission expense pertains to a peripheral activity, it would be reported as other expense.",what
"If inventory is understated at the end of the year, what is the effect on net income?","If inventory is understated at the end of the year, the net income for the year is also understated.
Here's a brief explanation. If a company has a cost of goods available of $100,000 and it assigns too little of that cost to inventory, then too much of that cost will appear on the income statement as the cost of goods sold. Too much cost on the income statement will mean too little net income.
Another way to view this is through the accounting equation, Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity. If you assign too little of the cost of goods available to Assets, then the amount of Owner's Equity will be too little—caused by net income being too little.",what
What is the accounting entry to close the sole proprietorship drawing account?,"Definition of Sole Proprietorship Drawing Account
The drawing or withdrawal account for a sole proprietorship is a temporary owner equity's account that is closed at the end of the accounting year. The drawing account is also a contra account to owner's equity, because the drawing account's debit balance is contrary to the normal credit balance for an owner's equity account.
At the end of the accounting year, the drawing account is closed directly to the capital account with an entry that debits the owner's capital account and credits the owner's drawing account. Please note that the owner's drawing account is not an expense and as a result it does not get closed to the Income Summary account nor will the amount appear on the company's income statement.
Example of the Entry to Close the Drawing Account
Let's assume that at the end of the accounting year the account Eve Jones, Drawing has a debit balance of $24,000. This balance is the result of Eve withdrawing $2,000 per month from her sole proprietorship for her personal use. (The monthly withdrawals were recorded with a debit to Eve Jones, Drawing and a credit to Cash.) The journal entry to close the drawing account at the end of the accounting year will credit Eve Jones, Drawing for $24,000 and will debit Eve Jones, Capital for $24,000.",what
What is the difference between income and profit?,"Some people intend for the terms income and profit to have the same meaning. For example, the income statement was commonly referred to as the profit and loss (P&L) statement. When a company is profitable, we mean that the company has a positive net income.
To aid in understanding these terms, the word ""net"" is often added. Hence, we often see the terms net income and net profit. This communicates that the amounts are the remainder after expenses have been deducted. For example, a company's profit margin is often listed as the net profit margin (which is defined as the company's net income divided by its net sales). The word ""net"" also helps to distinguish a company's net profit from its gross profit, and its net profit margin from its gross profit margin.
Some people use the term income to mean revenues. For example, a bank or an individual will often refer to the interest they earn on bond investments as interest income or investment income. A retailer will refer to the sales of merchandise as revenues, but the revenues from secondary activities will be reported as other income or nonoperating income.
It is wise to keep in mind that different meanings are not unusual among people, businesses and countries.",what
What is accrued rent?,"Definition of Accrued Rent
Accrued rent is the amount of rent that has not yet been paid by the tenant or received by the landlord for a past period of time. [If the tenant always pays the monthly rent on the first day of every, there will never be any accrued rent.] 
Under the accrual method of accounting the tenant should report:

Rent Expense during the period of time that the space was occupied but was not paid, and
A current liability Rent Payable for the amount owed to the landlord at each balance sheet date

Under the accrual method of accounting and assuming that the amount will be collected, the landlord should report:

Rent Revenue (or Rental Income) during the period of time that the space was occupied but the rent was not received from the tenant, and
A current asset Rent Receivable for the amount owed by the tenant at each balance sheet date

Example of Accrued Rent
A landlord and tenant agree to a monthly rent of $1,000 for office space beginning on October 1. Each month's rent is to be paid on the first day of the month. The tenant paid the monthly rent on October 1 and November 1, but asked the landlord if the December rent could be paid on February 1 (when the tenant will be receiving a large payment from a client). The landlord is assured that all rent due will be paid by February 1. Assuming that the tenant and the landlord use the accrual method of accounting, the following accrual adjusting entries are needed prior to issuing the December 31 financial statements:

The tenant will debit Rent Expense for $1,000 and will credit Rent Payable for $1,000
The landlord will debit Rent Receivable for $1,000 and will credit Rent Revenues for $1,000",what
What is interest payable?,"Definition of Interest Payable
Interest payable is the interest expense that has been incurred (has already occurred) but has not been paid as of the date of the balance sheet. [Interest payable does not include the interest for periods after the date of the balance sheet.]
Example of Interest Payable
Let's assume that on December 1 a company borrowed $100,000 at an annual interest rate of 12%. The company agrees to repay the principal amount of $100,000 plus 9 months of interest when the note comes due on August 31.
On December 31, the amount of interest payable is $1,000 ($100,000 X 12% X 1/12) and the company's balance sheet should report the following current liabilities:

Notes payable of $100,000
Interest payable of $1,000

Nothing is reported for the $8,000 of future interest.
The company's January 31 balance sheet should report the following current liabilities:

Notes payable of $100,000
Interest payable of $2,000",what
What is the difference between expense and loss?,"Definition of Expense
An expense is a cost that a company incurs or uses up when it earns revenues.
Examples of Expenses
A few examples of the many expenses that a company incurs in earning revenues are:

Cost of goods sold
Sales commissions expense
Delivery expense
Rent expense
Salaries expense
Advertising expense

Definition of Loss
A loss could have several meanings. The following examples illustrate how the term is used.
Examples of Losses
Some examples of losses include:

The sale of a long-lived asset for an amount that is less than the asset's book value
An unfavorable settlement of a lawsuit against the company
The retirement of bonds payable at a cost that is greater than the carrying value of the bonds

Loss is also used to describe write-down of inventory from cost to market.
Finally, loss is also used to describe the bottom line of an income statement that reports expenses in excess of revenues.
The FASB's Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No. 6 (December 1985) discusses expenses and losses in paragraphs 80-89. You can access this concepts statement at no cost at www.FASB.org/st by selecting ""Concepts Statements"".",what
What is the difference between revenues and earnings?,"A U.S. corporation's revenues  are reported on the top line of its income statement, while its earnings are reported on the bottom line (or near the bottom) of the income statement.
Revenues is the gross amount earned from selling goods or providing services during the period shown in the heading of the income statement. In other words, revenues is the amount earned before deducting the cost of goods sold, expenses, and losses.
Earnings is the net amount earned after deducting the cost of goods sold, expenses and losses. It is often presented as net earnings or net income. When a corporation's stock is publicly-traded, the earnings must also be reported on the income statement as earnings per share (EPS) of common stock.",what
Why is the P&L profit entered on the credit side of the balance sheet?,"Profit's Effect on the Balance Sheet
The profit or net income belongs to the owner of a sole proprietorship or to the stockholders of a corporation.
If a company prepares its balance sheet in the account form, it means that the assets are presented on the left side or debit side. The liabilities and owner's equity (or stockholders' equity) are presented on the right side or credit side.
Recall that the balance sheet reflects the accounting equation, Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity.
Example of Profit's Effect on the Balance Sheet
Assume that you own and operate a sole proprietorship. You provided a service to a client and earned revenues of $900 and had no expenses. One of the business assets (cash or accounts receivable) increased and the liabilities did not change. As a result, the owner's equity (the owner's capital account) increases.
Accountants do prepare an income statement or P&L to report the revenues and expenses, but the ultimate effect of a positive amount of profit or net income is to increase the business's assets and owner's equity.",what
Which accounts are debited in the closing entries?,"Definition of Closing Entries
Closing entries occur at the end of an accounting year to transfer the balances in the temporary accounts to a permanent or real account. The intended result is for each temporary account to begin the next accounting year with a zero balance.
The temporary accounts include the income statement accounts (revenue, expense, gain, loss, income summary) and also the drawing account of a sole proprietorship. The balances in these accounts will ultimately end up in the sole proprietor's capital account or the corporation's retained earnings account.
Accounts that are Debited in the Closing Entries
The following temporary accounts normally have credit balances that require a debit as part of the closing entries:

Revenue accounts
Gain accounts
Contra expense accounts

Income Statement: Retail/Whsle - Corporation, Multiple-Step
Statement of Owner's Equity: Sole Proprietor",what
"If a company earns a profit, which balance sheet items change?","Definition of Profit
Profit is the result of revenues minus expenses.
How Profits Change the Balance Sheet
Since all business transactions affect at least two accounts, there will likely be an enormous number of changes to the balance sheet. Here are some of the changes:

Owner's equity or stockholders' equity will increase by the positive amount of net income
Accounts receivable will change by the amount of sales/services provided with credit terms
Inventory will decrease when goods are sold
Cash will increase when goods are sold for cash and when accounts receivable are collected
Cash will decrease when cash is paid for expenses, inventory, equipment, liabilities, etc.
Accounts payable will increase for expenses that were not paid with cash
Accumulated depreciation will change when an asset is depreciated

Again, the list is just a few of the balance sheet changes that may occur when a company has profitable operations.",what
What is a bookkeeper?,"Definition of Bookkeeper
A bookkeeper is usually employed by a small to mid-size company (or other organization) to process and record the large volume of transactions involving sales, purchases, payroll, collection of accounts receivable, payment of bills, and more. After the recording of the transactions, an accountant or the business owner will review the bookkeeper's work and make the required adjusting entries before the company's financial statements are distributed. 
(Larger companies are likely to have accounts payable clerks, payroll clerks, cost accounting clerks, etc. instead of bookkeepers.)
Related: What is the difference between a bookkeeper and an accountant?
What a Bookkeeper Should Know
Bookkeepers are not expected to have a four-year or five-year college degree in accounting. However, the bookkeeper must be able to work quickly and accurately. Today's bookkeeper must be comfortable with accounting software such as QuickBooks and electronic worksheets. Being proficient with accounting software allows a bookkeeper to stand out from the others.
Salary Range for a Bookkeeper
The annual salary for a bookkeeper could range from $18,000 to more than $40,000. Some reasons for the wide salary range include the size and location of the company, the bookkeeper's responsibilities, the bookkeeper's experience with accounting and other software, the ability to get things done without supervision, etc. (In terms of an hourly wage, the bookkeeper's pay could range from $9 to $20 per hour.) 
How to Become a Bookkeeper

What is a/c?,"Definition of a/c
In accounting, a/c is the abbreviation for account.
Example of a/c
An accountant might leave the following note for a subordinate:
""Please review the balance in the a/c Interest Payable.""",what
What is the difference between adjusting entries and correcting entries?,"Definition of Adjusting Entries
Generally, adjusting entries are required at the end of every accounting period so that a company's financial statements reflect the accrual method of accounting.
Adjusting entries involve at least one income statement account and at least one balance sheet account.
Examples of Adjusting Entries
The following are some examples of the need for adjusting entries:

To report expenses and losses along with the related liabilities for transactions that have occurred but are not yet recorded in the general ledger accounts
To report revenues and gains along with the related assets for transactions that have occurred but are not yet recorded in the general ledger accounts
To defer future expenses and the related assets that were included in a previously recorded transaction
To defer future revenues and the related liabilities that were included in a previously recorded transaction
To record depreciation expense and/or bad debts expense and the change in the related contra asset account

Definition of Correcting Entries
Correcting entries are journal entries made to correct an error in a previously recorded transaction. Correcting entries can involve any combination of income statement accounts and balance sheet accounts.
Examples of Correcting Entries
The following are two examples of the need for correcting entries:

To correct an erroneous amount used when recording a previous transaction
To move an amount from an incorrect account (that was used when recording a previous transaction) to the correct account",what
What is stock?,"In accounting there are two common uses of the term stock. One meaning of stock refers to the goods on hand which is to be sold to customers. In that situation, stock means inventory.
The term stock is also used to mean the ownership shares of a corporation. For example, an owner of a corporation will have a stock certificate which provides evidence of his or her ownership of a corporation's common stock or preferred stock. The owner of the corporation's common or preferred stock is known as a stockholder.",what
How do I write off old outstanding checks?,"Years ago when a check appeared on the bank reconciliation's list of outstanding checks for a lengthy period the answer was easy:

Void the check and add the amount to your checkbook balance.
Debit the general ledger Cash account for the amount, and credit the account that was originally debited.
Remove the check from the bank reconciliation's list of outstanding checks.

Today, the answer is different for U.S. companies as states are now likely to have unclaimed property laws. For example, in my state a check issued to a vendor, but has not cleared the bank on which it is drawn, must be reported to the state after five years. In other words, you will now have to report a liability until the amount is remitted to your state.
Since you wrote the check  and intended for it to be paid from the money in your checking, why not contact the payee as soon as the check is outstanding for 30 days? You may learn that the payee did not receive the check, had misplaced it, etc. Why not help your vendor the way you would want to be helped by your customers?
In short, communicate with the payees of your outstanding checks and eliminate the need for reporting and remitting to your state government many years after the original transactions.",what
What does understated mean?,"When an accountant says that an amount is understated, it means two things:

The amount is not the correct amount, and
The amount is less than the true amount.  In other words, the amount is too small.

To illustrate the term understated, let's assume that a company is reporting its accounts payable as $21,000. Let's also assume that the correct or true amount of accounts payable is $23,000. An accountant will say that the reported amount of $21,000 is understated by $2,000.
Because of double-entry bookkeeping or accounting there will also be a second general ledger account with an error for the same amount.",what
What is the accrual method?,"The accrual method of accounting reports revenues on the income statement when they are earned even if the customer will pay 30 days later. At the time that the revenues are earned the company will credit a revenue account and will debit the asset account Accounts Receivable. (When the customer pays 30 days after the revenues were earned, the company will debit Cash and will credit Accounts Receivable.)
The accrual method of accounting also requires that expenses and losses be reported on the income statement when they occur even if payment will take place 30 days later. For example, if a company has a $15,000 repair done on December 15 and the vendor allows for payment on January 15, the company will report a repair expense and a liability of $15,000 as of December 15. (On January 15 the company will credit Cash and will debit the liability account.)
The accrual method of accounting, which is also known as the accrual basis of accounting, is required for large companies. (The cash method of accounting may be used by individuals and some small companies.) The accrual method and the associated adjusting entries will result in a more complete and accurate reporting of a company's assets, liabilities, equity, and earnings during each accounting period.",what
What is the difference between a contingent liability and an estimated liability?,"Definition of a Contingent Liability
A contingent liability is a potential liability (and a potential loss or potential expense). For a contingent liability to become an actual liability a future event must occur.
Examples of Contingent Liabilities
Assume someone files a lawsuit against Jay Corp. Jay Corp now has a contingent liability. The lawsuit will become an actual liability only if Jay Corp is unsuccessful in defending itself. (Many lawsuits are nuisance suits that will not be victorious in court.)
Another contingent liability is the warranty that automakers provide on new cars. Since it is probable (not merely possible) that some vehicles will require work during the warranty period and the automakers can estimate that amount, the estimated amount of the warranty cost will be reported as a liability on the automakers' balance sheets at the time that the cars are sold. The other part of the journal entry is to debit Warranty Expense and report it on the income statement.
Definition of an Estimated Liability
An estimated liability is a liability that is absolutely owed because the services or goods have been received. However, the vendors' invoices have not yet been received and the exact amount is not yet known. The company is required to estimate the amount since the estimated amount is far better than implying that no liability is owed and that no expense was incurred. Many of the accrual adjusting entries require estimated amounts.
Examples of Estimated Liabilities
Liabilities that are not contingent liabilities but are estimated liabilities include the following:

The electricity and natural gas consumed but the bill has not been received
An emergency repair that occurred but the bill has not been received
Real estate taxes that have occurred but the tax bill has not been received
Worker compensation insurance premiums which have occurred but the bill has not been received

These liabilities must be recorded by using estimated amounts.",what
What is the journal entry to record a one-year subscription for a magazine?,"Ways to Record One-Year Subscriptions
Let's assume that the cost of the one-year subscription for a monthly trade publication is $120. Let's also assume the payment is made at the start of the subscription period, and that your company prepares monthly financial statements.
One way to enter the transaction is to debit the current asset Prepaid Subscriptions for $120 and to credit Cash for $120. At the end of each month an adjusting entry would be prepared to debit Subscriptions Expense for $10 and to credit Prepaid Subscriptions for $10. This approach would obviously match the annual cost to each of the 12 monthly periods benefiting from the subscription. However, this is not practical given the small amount involved.
Thanks to the accounting concept of materiality, accountants can ignore the matching principle when the amount is insignificant in relationship to the company's size. Since no investor or lender would be misled if the entire $120 appeared as an expense in one month and $0 appeared in the other 11 months, the following entry would be more practical: debit Subscriptions Expense for $120 and credit Cash for $120 at the time of entering the invoice into the accounting records.
If an annual trade group membership fee is $6,000 and the amount is significant for the company, the company should record the payment as a prepaid asset and then write a monthly adjusting entry for $500.",what
What are sales discounts?,"Definition of Sales Discounts
Sales discounts (if offered by sellers) reduce the amounts owed to the sellers of products, when the buyers pay within the stated discount periods. Sales discounts are also known as cash discounts and early payment discounts.
Sales discounts are recorded in a contra revenue account such as Sales Discounts. Hence, its debit balance will be one of the deductions from sales (gross sales) in order to report the amount of net sales.
Example of Sales Discounts
To illustrate a sales discount let's assume that a manufacturer sells $900 of products and its credit terms are 1/10, n/30. This means that the buyer can satisfy the $900 obligation if it pays $891 ($900 minus $9 of sales discount) within 10 days. The alternative is for the buyer to pay $900 within 30 days.
If the buyer pays the $891 within 10 days, the seller will record the money received as follows:

Debit Cash for $891
Debit Sales Discounts for $9
Credit Accounts Receivable for $900",what
Why is Rent Expense a debit and Service Revenues a credit?,"Why Rent Expense is a Debit
Rent expense (and any other expense) will reduce a company's owner's equity (or stockholders' equity). Owner's equity which is on the right side of the accounting equation is expected to have a credit balance. Therefore, to reduce the credit balance, the expense accounts will require debit entries.
Example of Rent Expense as a Debit
If a company pays $800 for the current month's rent, the company's assets and its owner's equity will decrease. To decrease an asset such as Cash, the company will credit the Cash account for $800. Since every entry must have debits equal to credits, the company will need to debit another account for $800. In this case, the account is Rent Expense. (Eventually the debit balance in the Rent Expense account will be transferred/closed to the proprietor's capital account or to a corporation's retained earnings account.)
Why Service Revenues is a Credit
Service revenues (and any other revenues) will increase a company's owner's equity (or stockholders' equity). Owner's equity which is on the right side of the accounting equation is expected to have a credit balance. Therefore, to increase the credit balance, the revenues accounts will have to be credited.
Example of Service Revenues as a Credit
If the company earns and receives $300 for providing a service, the company's assets and owner's equity will increase. The asset Cash will be increased with a debit of $300. Therefore, another account will need to be credited. In this case Service Revenues will be credited for $300. Service Revenues is a temporary account that will eventually be closed to the owner's equity account.",what
In what order are liabilities listed in the chart of accounts?,"Order for Listing Liabilities
It is logical for a company's liabilities to be organized in the chart of accounts in the same way as they are presented on the balance sheet:

Current liabilities
Noncurrent or long-term liabilities

Order for Listing Current Liabilities
Within the current liabilities classification, the order in which the current liability accounts are listed can vary. Here is a summary of how they might be organized:

Short-term notes payable
Current portions of long-term debt
Accounts payable
Payroll related liabilities
Other accrued expenses
Income taxes payable

Again, the order will vary. For example, some companies will list Accounts Payable as the first current liability account.",what
What is a memorandum entry?,"Definition of Memorandum Entry
A memorandum entry is a short message entered into the general journal and also entered into a general ledger account. It is not a complete journal entry because it does not contain debit and credit amounts.
Example of Memorandum Entry
The following entry for a stock split is an example of a memorandum entry:
""On June 7, 2019 a 2-for-1 stock split was declared for the common stockholders of record as of the end of the day on June 28, 2019. The stock split will result in the number of issued and outstanding shares of common shares increasing from 200,000 shares to 400,000 shares.""
Since a stock split does not change the balance in the Common Stock account, a complete journal entry was not required. The memorandum entry merely notes for future reference that the number of shares of stock has changed.",what
What are sales?,"In accounting, sales refers to the revenues earned when a company sells its goods, products, merchandise, etc. (If a company sells one of its noncurrent assets that was used in its business, the amount received is not recorded in its Sales account.)
The amounts recorded at the time of the sales transaction is also known as gross sales since there may be subsequent subtractions for sales returns, sales allowances, and early payment discounts. (Gross sales minus these subtractions results in the amount of net sales.)
Under the accrual basis or accrual method of accounting, goods sold on credit are reported as sales (revenue) when the goods have been transferred to the buyer. Usually this occurs before the seller receives payment from the buyer. The sales on credit are recorded with a debit to Accounts Receivable and a credit to Sales.",what
What does crossfoot mean?,"Accountants use the word foot to mean adding a column of numbers. To crossfoot means to verify that the sum of the totals in various columns also agrees to a grand total.
For example, assume you have a table of numbers that shows the sales of five items for the past week. Column A consists of the names of the five items. Columns B through H show the sales of each item for the days Sunday (Column B) through Saturday (Column H). Column I reports each item's total sales for the week. After footing each of the eight columns B through I, a good accountant will verify that the total of the totals in Columns B through H agrees to the total of Column I. This last step is known as crossfooting.",what
What is a credit?,"In bookkeeping and accounting, a credit could refer to the entry on the right side of a T-account. A credit could also be a verb that means the act of recording an amount on the right side of a T-account.
A credit entry in an asset account will reduce the account's usual debit entry.  A credit entry in a revenue, liability, or owner's equity account will increase the usual credit balance.
A credit could also mean your bank has increased your bank account balance. Your bank account is a liability for your bank and when your bank account increases, your bank has a larger obligation to you.
Credit can also refer to loans, such as line of credit, letter of credit, credit rating, as so on.",what
How do you estimate the amount of uncollectible accounts receivable?,"One way to estimate the amount of uncollectible accounts receivable is to prepare an aging. An aging of accounts receivable lists every customer's balance and then sorts each customer's balance according to the amount of time since the date of the sale. For example, assume that all sales are made with terms of 30 days. Let's also assume that Customer A has an accounts receivable balance of $12,000—consisting of $8,000 that was sold 15 days ago and $4,000 that was sold 40 days ago.
The $8,000 will be entered into the column with the heading ""Current"" and $4,000 will be entered into the column with the heading ""1-30 days past due."" After the sorting/entering is done for each and every customer, the columns are summed. The ""Current"" column is likely to be collectible. However, the amounts in the column headed ""1-30 days past due"" might not be 100% collected. The amounts in the column with the heading ""31-60 days past due"" will have a higher probability of being uncollectible. The column ""61-90 days past due"" indicates a still greater likelihood of not being collected. And the amounts in the column ""More than 90 days past due"" will be even less likely to be collected in their entirety.
Examining the details of each of the past due accounts will help you estimate the amount that will likely be uncollectible.
Another way to estimate the amount of uncollectible accounts is to simply record a percentage of credit sales. For example, if your company and its industry has a long run experience of 0.2% of credit sales being uncollectible, you might enter 0.2% of each period's credit sales as a debit to Bad Debt Expense and a credit to Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.",what
Why isn't land depreciated?,"Land is not depreciated because land is assumed to have an unlimited useful life.
Other long-lived assets such as land improvements, buildings, furnishings, equipment, etc. have limited useful lives. Therefore, the costs of those assets must be allocated to those limited accounting periods. Since land's life is not limited, there is no need to allocate the cost of land to any accounting periods.",what
What is a contra liability account?,"A contra liability account is a liability account where the balance is expected to be a debit balance. Since a debit balance in a liability account is contrary to the normal credit balance, the account is referred to as a contra liability account.
The most common contra liability accounts are Discount on Bonds Payable, Bond Issue Costs, Debt Issue Costs, and Discount on Notes Payable. The debit balances in these accounts are amortized or allocated to Interest Expense over the life of the bonds or notes.
The credit balance in the liability account Bonds Payable minus the debit balances in the contra liability accounts Discount on Bonds Payable and Bond Issue Costs is the carrying value or book value of the bonds. The credit balance in Notes Payable minus the debit balances in Discount on Notes Payable and Debt Issue Costs is the carrying value or book value of the notes payable.",what
What is a promissory note?,"Definition of Promissory Note
A promissory note is a written promise to pay an amount of money by a specified date (or perhaps on demand). The maker of the promissory note agrees to pay the principal amount and interest.
The maker of the promissory note is known as the borrower or debtor and records the amount owed in a liability account such as Notes Payable. The person or organization that has the right to receive the money when the promissory note comes due is known as the lender or creditor and records that amount in an asset account such as Notes Receivable.
Under the accrual method of accounting, both the borrower and the lender must report any accrued interest  as of each balance sheet date. The maker/borrower of the note will report interest expense and interest payable. The creditor/lender will report the accrued interest as interest income and interest receivable.
Example of a Promissory Note
A promissory note is created when a company borrows money from its bank. However, a promissory note could also be used when a company is unable to pay one of its suppliers as agreed. In that situation, the supplier may demand that the company issue a promissory note. This results in the company replacing its account payable with a note payable, and the supplier replacing its account receivable with a note receivable.",what
What is double-entry bookkeeping?,"Definition of Double-Entry Bookkeeping
Double-entry bookkeeping refers to the 500-year-old system in which each financial transaction of a company is recorded with an entry into at least two of its general ledger accounts.
At least one account will have an amount entered as a debit and at least one account will have an amount entered as a credit. Further, the total amounts entered as debits must be equal to the total amounts entered as credits. Meeting these requirements will result in the accounting or bookkeeping equation being in balance at all times.
Examples of Double-Entry Bookkeeping
Let's assume that a company borrows $10,000 from its bank. The company's asset account Cash is increased with a debit entry of $10,000 and the company's liability account Loans Payable is increased with a credit entry of $10,000. If the company repays $3,000 of the amount borrowed, the company will decrease the amount in its Cash account with a credit entry of $3,000 and will reduce the balance in its Loan Payable account with a debit entry of $3,000.
If the company pays its monthly rent of $2,000, a credit entry of $2,000 will be recorded in its Cash account and a $2,000 debit entry will be recorded in its Rent Expense account.
If a company collects $500 from a customer who had previously purchased goods on credit, the company will make a debit entry of $500 in its Cash account and will make a credit entry of $500 in its asset account Accounts Receivable.",what
What is salvage value?,"In accounting, salvage value is an estimated amount that is expected to be received at the end of a plant asset's useful life. Salvage value is sometimes referred to as disposal value, residual value, terminal value, or scrap value.
The estimated salvage value is deducted from the cost of the asset in order to determine the total amount of depreciation expense that will be reported during the asset's useful life.
Accountants and income tax regulations often assume that plant assets will have no salvage value. This will result in an asset's entire cost being depreciated during the years that the asset is used in the business.",what
What is ERP?,"In accounting, ERP is the acronym for enterprise resource planning. ERP could be described as a database software package that supports all of a business's processes and operations including manufacturing, marketing, financial, human resources, and so on. In other words, the goal of ERP is to have one integrated system for the entire company.
The integration of all of a company's information from all departments, processes, operations, etc. requires that an ERP system be very sophisticated. This in turn requires a company to commit considerable resources for planning, training, and implementing an ERP system.
Two of the suppliers or vendors of major ERP systems are SAP and Oracle.",what
What is a post-dated check?,"Definition of a Post-dated Check
A post-dated check (or post-dated cheque) is a check written with a future date. In other words, the date that appears on the check is after the date when the check was written. Even with a future date appearing on the check, the check could clear (be paid from) the bank account prior to that date.
Post-dating a check makes sense only if you are certain that the payee will not cash or deposit the check before the date appearing on the check.
Example of a Post-dated Check
To illustrate, let's assume that on May 22 Jim owes a supplier $2,000 for purchases made 40 days ago. Since Jim does not have the money to pay the supplier, he offers to mail the supplier two $1,000 checks: one check dated for June 20 and the other check dated for July 20. 
The supplier agrees to hold the checks and deposit them on the dates shown on the checks. Jim assures the supplier that the checks will be paid by his bank on those dates.
On June 4, when the supplier receives Jim's postdated checks, the supplier should not debit cash nor credit accounts receivable. The reason is that the checks cannot be turned into cash prior to the dates shown on the checks.",what
What is the difference between a bookkeeper and an accountant?,"Before I provide a distinction, you should be aware that some people use the words interchangeably. Even though I was the accountant, treasurer, and CFO of a company, the owner introduced me to a group of business leaders as the bookkeeper. He knew I kept the company's books, so ""bookkeeper"" made sense to him. (Later, I tried to explain to him that he should not introduce me as the bookkeeper...after all I was an accountant with an MBA and CPA.)
Generally, a bookkeeper is a person without a college degree in accounting who performs much of the data entry tasks. This includes entering the bills from vendors, paying bills, processing payroll data, preparing sales invoices, mailing statements to customers, etc.
The accountant is likely to have a college degree with a major in accounting and takes over where the bookkeeper leaves off. The accountant will prepare adjusting entries to record expenses that occurred but are not yet entered by the bookkeeper. (Examples include interest on bank loans since the last loan payment, wages earned by employees that will be processed next week, etc.) Other adjustments to accounts include the calculation and recording of depreciation, establishing allowances for uncollectible accounts, etc.). After making the adjusting entries, the accountant prepares the company's financial statements (income statement, balance sheet, statement of cash flows.) The accountant also assists the company's management to understand the financial impact of its past and future decisions.
The distinction between accountant and bookkeeper keeps changing as accounting software and other software evolves. For many years, companies used the title of accounting clerks for employees doing the tasks formerly performed by bookkeepers. The accounting clerks are usually supervised by an accountant.",what
What are some tips to make learning debits and credits easy?,"Here are five tips to make learning debits and credits easier:

The accounts for expenses are nearly always debited. For example, when a company pays its monthly rent, it debits Rent Expense. If it runs an ad on the radio, it will debit Advertising Expense.
The accounts for revenues are almost always credited. When a bakery sells its products, it credits Sales. When a bank earns interest on its loans, it credits Loan Interest Revenues.
When a company issues a check, it credits the asset account Cash.
When a company receives money, it debits Cash.
Every transaction will require a debit to at least one account and a credit to at least one other account.

Here are two examples to illustrate our five tips. 

A bakery records its cash sales at a local market with a debit to Cash and a credit to Sales.
A company records its $400 payment to repair its delivery van with a debit to Vehicle Repair Expense and a credit to Cash.",what
How does the accounting equation stay in balance when the monthly rent is paid?,"How a Rent Payment Affects the Accounting Equation
A company's payment of each month's rent reduces the company's asset Cash. This is recorded with a credit to Cash.
If the payment is for the current month's rent, the second account is to the temporary account Rent Expense which will be debited. The debit to Rent Expense also causes owner's equity (or stockholders' equity) to decrease. Eventually, the balances in the company's temporary accounts will actually be transferred/closed to the owner's capital account (or to a corporation's retained earnings account within stockholders' equity).
To recap the above, the monthly rent payment keeps the sole proprietor's accounting equation, Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity, in balance because it reduces the company's assets and it reduces the company's owner's equity.",what
What is a vendor?,"A vendor is a person or business that supplies goods or services to a company. Another term for vendor is supplier.
In many situations a company presents the vendor with a purchase order stating the goods or services needed, the price, delivery date, and other terms. Generally, when the vendor delivers the goods or services it will also send an invoice to the company. The company should then match the vendor's invoice with its purchase order and receiving report. If the three documents are in agreement, the company can than arrange for payment to the vendor.",what
What is a recurring journal entry?,"A recurring journal entry is a journal entry that is recorded in every accounting period. For example, a company issuing monthly financial statements might record depreciation by debiting Depreciation Expense for $3,000 and crediting Accumulated Depreciation for $3,000 each and every month. If the accounts and the amounts are identical each month, the recurring journal entry might be referred to as a memorized entry if the accounting software produces and records the entry. Some accountants refer to this type of recurring journal entry as a standard journal entry.
The term recurring journal entry can also refer to monthly journal entries where the accounts are identical but the amounts vary by month. For example, the journal entry to record property insurance expense might involve Insurance Expense and Prepaid Insurance every month, but the amounts will change when the amount of the prepaid insurance premiums change. Other recurring entries will involve the identical accounts, but the amounts will be different in each accounting period. An example is the payroll entry. Each payroll entry will have the same accounts but different amounts due to the number of hours worked. Other examples of recurring entries with amounts that differ each period include sales, interest earned, interest expense, bank service charges, and so on.
One company's recurring entry with differing amounts is generated by its software. Each month its computer system debits Freight Expense and credits a liability Accrued Freight  for the pounds shipped multiplied by a freight cost per pound. When the freight bills are received and paid, the liability and its cash are reduced. As long as its cost per pound is accurate, the company's computer system is routinely achieving the matching principle and the accrual method of accounting with little professional effort.
Keep in mind that accountants may have different definitions of recurring journal entries.",what
Is an entry made for outstanding checks when preparing a bank reconciliation?,"No entry is made to a company's general ledger for outstanding checks when preparing a bank reconciliation. The reason is outstanding checks are an adjustment to the bank balance. Outstanding checks are not an adjustment to the company's Cash account in its general ledger.
However, if a company voids one of its outstanding checks, the company will need to make an entry to its general ledger. The entry will debit Cash in order to increase the account balance. The credit portion of the entry will likely be to the account that was originally debited when the check was issued.",what
What is the difference between unearned revenue and unrecorded revenue?,"In financial accounting, unearned revenue refers to amounts received prior to being earned. For example, if ABC Service Co. receives $24,000 on December 31, 2012 for a one-year service agreement covering January 1 through December 31, 2013, the entire $24,000 is unearned as of December 31, 2012. On the December 31, 2012 balance sheet ABC should report a liability such as Unearned Revenues for $24,000. During 2013 ABC should move $2,000 per month from the liability account on its balance sheet to a revenue account on its income statement.
I associate unrecorded revenue with revenues that were earned, but not yet recorded in a company's accounting records. For example, an electric utility will provide electricity to customers for up to one month before it reads the customers' meters, calculates the bills and records the billings as revenues and accounts receivable. As a result, the electric utility will have up to one month of unrecorded revenue. At each balance sheet date, the utility should accrue for the revenues it earned but had not yet recorded. This is done through an adjusting entry that debits a balance sheet receivable account and credits an income statement revenue account.",what
How do you calculate the payroll accrual?,"The payroll accrual is the amount that needs to be entered into a liability account in order for the credit balance in the liability account to be the amount owed to employees. The amount owed is the amount the employees have earned from working, but as of the date of the balance sheet this amount has not been paid to the employees.
To illustrate the payroll accrual, assume that a company's employees were paid on September 30 for their work through September 25. The credit balance needed in the liability account as of September 30 is the amount that the employees earned for the days of September 26 through September 30.",what
What is a post-closing trial balance?,"A post-closing trial balance is a trial balance which is prepared after all of the temporary accounts in the general ledger have been closed. The temporary accounts include 1) the income statement accounts consisting of revenue, expense, gain, and loss accounts, 2) the summary accounts, and 3) the few temporary balance sheet accounts such as the sole proprietor's drawing account or the corporation's dividend account.
All trial balances should have a heading that includes the company name, the words Trial Balance, and the date of the account balances. After the heading you will likely see the following four columns: account number, account title, debit balance amount, and credit balance amount. Most trial balances will not list any account having a $0.00 balance. As a result, the post-closing trial balance will list only the balance sheet accounts with a balance other than zero. The debit and credit amount columns will be summed and the totals should be identical.
Today's accounting software will likely generate a post-closing trial balance or any other trial balance with the click of a mouse. Thanks to accounting software, trial balances are likely to be in balance since the manual calculations have been eliminated.",what
Where does accrued interest on notes receivable get reported on the balance sheet?,"Accrued interest on notes receivable is likely to be reported as a current asset such as Accrued Interest Receivable or Interest Receivable. The accrued interest receivable is a current asset if the interest amount is expected to be collected within one year of the balance sheet date.
I would expect that even a long-term note receivable that is due in five years will require that the interest on the note be paid quarterly, semiannually or annually. Hence the accrued interest will be a current asset.
If the interest on the note is not expected to be received within one year of the balance sheet date, then the accrued interest receivable should be reported as a long-term asset.",what
A credit is not a normal balance for what accounts?,"A credit is not a normal balance for asset accounts, the purchase account under the periodic inventory system, expense accounts, and the owner's drawing account.
Exceptions to this list would be contra accounts such as Allowance for Doubtful Accounts (a contra account to the asset Accounts Receivable) and Accumulated Depreciation (a contra account to depreciable assets). In other words, credit balances are expected for contra asset accounts. Purchase Discounts and Purchase Returns and Allowances (which are contra accounts to Purchases) are expected to have credit balances.
A general rule is that asset accounts will normally have debit balances. Liability and stockholders' equity accounts will normally have credit balances. Revenue accounts will have credit balances (since revenues will increase stockholders' or owner's equity). Expense accounts will normally have debit balances as they cause stockholders' and owner's equity to decrease.",what
What is an invoice?,"An invoice is defined in a Webster's dictionary as ""an itemized bill for goods sold or services provided, containing individual prices, the total charge, and the terms.""
The invoice is often referred to as the sales invoice. However, the purchaser of the goods or services might refer to the invoice received from the vendor or supplier as a purchase invoice.",what
Will every transaction affect an income statement account and a balance sheet account?,"No. Some transactions affect only balance sheet accounts. For example, when a company pays a supplier for goods previously purchased with terms of net 30 days, the payment will be recorded as a debit to the liability account  Accounts Payable  and as a credit to the asset account Cash. (No revenue account or expense account is involved.)
Another example of a transaction affecting two balance sheet accounts and no income statement account is a deposit for future services. The payer will debit the asset Prepaid Expenses and will credit the asset Cash. The company receiving the payment will debit Cash and will credit a liability account such as Customer Deposits, Unearned Revenues or Deferred Revenues.
Adjusting entries are a classification of accounting entries that will affect a balance sheet account and an income statement account.",what
How do you record a return deposit item on a bank statement?,"A deposited check that bounces (the deposited check is returned unpaid by the bank on which it is drawn) is deducted automatically on the depositor's bank statement. The depositor needs to reduce its general ledger account Cash for the amount that was deducted on its bank statement. (In other words, the bank statement is correct and needs no adjustment. It is the depositor's accounting records that do not reflect the returned check.) This means that the depositor needs to 1) credit Cash, and 2) debit the account that was credited when the depositor originally received the check.
Often the depositor's bank will also charge a fee for handling the returned item. Since that fee is automatically deducted on the bank statement, the amount needs to be deducted from the depositor's Cash account. The journal entry will be a credit to Cash and a debit to another account such as a receivable account.
A simple rule is that the adjustment must go where the item is not yet present. Since the return item and the related bank fee are already on the bank statement, the adjustment must go to the general ledger accounts.",what
What is the difference between expenses and payments?,"Under the accrual method of accounting, expenses are costs that have been used up or have been incurred in the process of earning revenues and/or operating a business. For example, a retailer will report its cost of the goods sold as an expense of the period in which the related sales occurred (even if the retailer has not yet paid for the goods, or had paid for the goods in an earlier period). Some expenses are allocations of a cost that was paid in an earlier period (e.g. depreciation of an asset purchased in a previous year, the allocation of a 6-month insurance premium). Expenses also include costs incurred in the current period that will be paid in a later period (e.g. current advertising that will be paid for in the next accounting period). Interest on a loan is a daily expense even though all of the interest will be paid when the loan comes due in the next accounting period.
A payment is a disbursement of money (usually in the form of a check or currency). Some payments are current period expenses (e.g. current month's rent payment) but many payments are not expenses of the current period. Here are a few examples of payments that are not expenses:

a payment of $100,000 to purchase the land adjacent to a company will never become an expense
payments that are cash dividends to stockholders will never be a corporation's expense
principal payments to reduce a loan payable will never be an expense
payments to remit payroll tax withholdings will never be an expense
payments to reduce liabilities resulting from expenses reported in earlier accounting periods (e.g. payments to reduce interest payable, accounts payable, taxes payable)

Some current period payments will result in expenses in future periods:

payments for construction of a building that will be put into service next year
payments for an exhibit at next year's trade show
payments for services to be received in a future accounting period",what
"In accounting, what is the meaning of dr.?","In accounting, dr. is the abbreviation for the word debit. (Today, accountants and bookkeepers use the term debit, but five centuries ago in Italy, the term included the letter ""r"".)
In accounting and bookkeeping, debit or dr. indicates an entry on the left side of a general ledger account. Typically, the accounts for assets and expenses will have debit balances. Debit entries will also reduce the credit balances typically found in the liability and stockholders' equity accounts.",what
How does petty cash affect expenses?,"Definition of Petty Cash
Petty cash is a small amount of currency and coins that a company has available to make very small payments instead of requesting and processing a company check. The amount of the petty cash fund is recorded in a current asset account entitled Petty Cash when the petty cash fund is established.
Example of Petty Cash Affecting Expenses
Assume that the petty cash money is used to pay postage of $10. While the company incurs this cost at the time of payment, it will be recorded in the general ledger account Postage Expense when the petty cash fund is replenished. 
In order to get the expenses entered in the proper accounting period, it is necessary to replenish the petty cash fund at the end of each accounting period. (This is done in addition to replenishing the fund whenever the currency and coins are low.)",what
Why do we charge depreciation?,"We charge depreciation because most of the long-lived assets used in a business have 1) a significant cost, and 2) they will be useful only for a limited number of years. The matching principle (a basic underlying accounting principle) requires that the actual cost of these assets be allocated to the accounting periods in which the company will benefit from their use.
The depreciation reported on a U.S. corporation's external financial statements is computed by spreading an asset's cost (less any salvage value) over the asset's service life or useful life. For example, equipment with a cost of $500,000 and no salvage value at the end of an assumed useful life of 10 years will likely result in matching $50,000 to each full accounting year. (The U.S. income tax rules allow accelerating the depreciation amounts, but the total cannot exceed the asset's cost.)
Examples of the assets that must be depreciated include machinery, equipment, fixtures, furnishings, buildings, vehicles, etc. These assets are often referred to as fixed assets or plant assets, and the amounts spent are part of a corporation's capital expenditures. (Note that land is not depreciated because it is assumed to last indefinitely.)",what
What is a purchase allowance?,"A purchase allowance is a reduction in the buyer's cost of merchandise that it had purchased. The purchase allowance is granted by the supplier because of a problem such as shipping the wrong items, the incorrect quantity, flaws in the goods, etc. In the case of a purchase allowance, the buyer does not return the merchandise to the supplier.
Under a periodic inventory system, the buyer will record the purchase allowance with 1) a credit to the account Purchase Allowances or to the account Purchase Returns and Allowances, and 2) a debit to Accounts Payable. (The supplier will record the allowance with a debit to Sales Allowances and a credit to Accounts Receivable.)
The buyer will offset the debit balance in its Purchases account with the credit balance in Purchase Allowances as part of its computation of net purchases.",what
Why do purchases appear as expenses on an income statement?,"Generally, the purchases of merchandise are sold in the year they are acquired. Hence, it is logical to match the current period's purchases as expenses on the same income statement that reports the current period's sales revenues.
If some of the purchases are not sold in the same period, there will be a change in inventory. An increase in the amount of inventory will appear on the income statement as a deduction to the current period's purchases. It is a deduction because some of the costs of the current period's purchases are not associated with the sales shown on the income statement. The deduction is reporting that some of the costs of purchases are being deferred to a later period when they will be sold. The deduction is necessary in order to achieve the matching principle: matching the proper amount of the costs of the goods sold with the sales revenues of the accounting period.
A decrease in the amount of inventory will appear on the income statement as an addition to the cost of the purchases. This recognizes that some of the sales included some costs of purchases that were made in an earlier accounting period.",what
What is the difference between reserve and provision?,"In the U.S. the use of the word reserve has been discouraged for several decades. In its place, the accounting profession has recommended the use of words such as allowance, accumulated, or provision. For instance, many years ago the contra account to a plant asset may have been titled Depreciation Reserve. To some readers, that name implied that cash had been set aside to replace the asset. To better communicate reality, the accounting profession recommended a more descriptive title such as Accumulated Depreciation. Similarly, the contra account to Accounts Receivable may have been titled Reserve for Bad Debts. Again, that title could imply that money was set aside. To avoid misinterpretation, the accounting profession suggested Allowance for Bad Debts or Provision for Bad Debts.
The word provision might appear in the title of a contra account as we just noted. In addition, provision will occasionally appear in the title of an expense account, such as Provision for Income Taxes.",what
What is the accounting entry when an order is received?,"There is no accounting entry recorded in a company's general ledger accounts when an order is received.
The reason is that a sale or sales revenues has not yet occurred, nor does the company have an accounts receivable at this point. Generally, the sale and the related receivable occur when the goods are shipped (FOB shipping point) or when the goods are received by the customer (FOB destination).
While there is no accounting entry in the general ledger, it is likely that the company will create a record outside of the general ledger to track the order and to schedule various activities that will be needed to ship the products to the customer.",what
What is the abbreviation for debit and credit?,"Abbreviation for Debit and Credit
The abbreviation for debit is dr. and the abbreviation for credit is cr.
Apparently the ""dr."" is associated with the term used in Italy more than 500 years ago, rather than the word ""debit"" which we use today.",what
Can you help me understand the golden rules of accounting?,"The golden rules of accounting are not presented in any of the U.S. accounting books that I have reviewed. I assume the reason for omitting the golden rules of accounting is that short phrases such as ""debit the receiver"" or ""credit what goes out"" or ""personal accounts"" are inadequate and not helpful to people such as yourself.

What is separation of duties?,"The separation of duties is one of several steps to improve the internal control of an organization's assets. For example, the internal control of cash is improved if the money handling duties are separated from the record keeping duties. By separating these duties the likelihood of theft is reduced because it will now require two dishonest people working together to admit to each other that they are dishonest, plan the theft, and to then carry out the theft. One person will have to remove the cash and the other person will have to falsify the records.
Without the separation of duties, the theft of cash is easier. One dishonest person can steal the money and enter a fictitious amount into the records—thereby concealing the theft.
Another step in improving internal control over cash is to use a cash register, issue receipts, and have two people present when cash is handled.",what
What is accounts payable?,"Accounts payable may refer to:

A section of the accounting department that is responsible for processing vendor invoices and other bills for goods and services that a company received on credit.
The title of the current liability account containing the amounts owed for vendor invoices and other bills that have been approved but not yet paid. The balance in Accounts Payable is expected to be a credit balance.
Amounts owed which did not involve a promissory note. If a promissory note is involved, the account Notes Payable will be used instead of Accounts Payable.

If the company owes for goods and services and the amounts are not yet recorded in Accounts Payable, they must be entered with an adjusting entry at the end of the accounting period. The credit portion of the adjusting entry is likely to be recorded in a separate current liability account such as Accrued Expenses and Liabilities.
Accounts payable may also be referred to as trade payables.
To learn more about the various aspects of accounts payable, see our Explanation, Quiz, Q&A, and more.",what
What is the difference in salaries between a bookkeeper and an accountant?,"I  estimate that a bookkeeper's salary will be less than half of an accountant's salary. For example, an accountant with a year or two of experience might earn $60,000 per year while a bookkeeper will earn less than $30,000 per year. More experienced accountants will be able to earn higher salaries but bookkeepers will not see significant salary increases. Some explanations for the salary differences are listed below.
Generally, a bookkeeper's formal education will be less than a four-year college degree. Accountants generally have a 120 or 150 credit college degree including at least 30 credits of accounting courses plus 30 credits of other business courses.
A bookkeeper is likely to be employed at a smaller company or organization and will process a large volume of routine transactions. An accountant is likely to be employed at a larger company and will be able to delegate the processing of the high-volume routine transactions to accounting clerks. In turn, the accountant will deal with more complicated transactions, will review the financial statements, and will assist management in the planning and control of the organization.",what
What is a restrictive endorsement?,"A restrictive endorsement or restricted endorsement places a limitation on the use of a check or other negotiable financial instrument. The most common restrictive endorsement is the phrase For Deposit Only written along with the payee's signature on the back of a check. Other wording for a similar restrictive endorsement might be Pay to the Order of Sample Bank for deposit to account #xxxx followed by the payee's signature. Many companies endorse checks by using a rubber stamp containing this restriction.
Using a restrictive endorsement is one of many actions that a company can take in order to improve the internal control of its assets.",what
What does double entry mean?,"Double entry means that every transaction will involve at least two accounts. For example, if your company borrows money from the bank, the company's asset Cash is increased and the company's liability Notes Payable is increased. If your company pays the six-month insurance premium, your company's asset Cash is decreased and its asset Prepaid Insurance is increased. If an employee works for hourly wages, the company's account Wages Expense is increased and its liability account Wages Payable is increased. When the employee is paid, the account Wages Payable is decreased and Cash is decreased.
Double entry also requires that one account be debited and the other account be credited. Accounting software might record the effect on one account automatically and only require information on the other account. For example, if you are preparing a check, the software will automatically reduce the Cash account. Therefore, the accounting software needs only to prompt you for information on the other account involved in the payment being processed.",what
What is a contra expense account?,"A contra expense account is a general ledger expense account that is expected to have a credit balance instead of the usual debit balance. In other words, the account's credit balance is contrary to (or opposite of) the usual debit balance for an expense account.
Another description of a contra expense account is an account that reduces or offsets the amounts reported in one or more of the other general ledger expense accounts.
One use of a contra expense account is to record the amounts of expenses that were reimbursed by its employees. For example, Company M might debit its expense account 4210 Employee Health Insurance Expense when recording the insurance company invoice of $10,000. If Company M required its employees to reimburse it for $2,000, Company M could credit its contra expense account 4211 Portion of 4210 Reimb by Employees. The benefit of using the contra expense account is that the company's managers can look in account 4210 to immediately see the company's total cost of the health insurance. They can also easily see in account 4211 the amount that the employees paid. The income statement could simply report the net amount of the expense, which is $8,000 ($10,000 minus $2,000).",what
Should inventories be reported at their cost or at their selling prices?,"Generally inventories are reported at their cost. A merchant's inventory would be reported at the merchant's cost to purchase the items. A manufacturer's inventory would be at its cost to produce the items (the cost of direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead).
However, if the net realizable value (NRV) of the inventory is less than the cost, the NRV will usually need to be reported on the balance sheet instead of the cost. Net realizable value is defined as the expected selling price in the ordinary course of business minus any costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. When the cost of the inventory is written down to its NRV, the amount of the write down is reported on the income statement. (In a few industries, such as gold mining and meatpacking, it is accepted practice to report the inventory at its net realizable value.)
Since the unit cost of items in inventory is likely to be changing (think inflation), the costs used for inventory reporting will be based on a cost flow assumption. For example, the FIFO cost flow assumption will result in the inventory being reported at the more recent costs, since the first costs are assumed to have been the first costs out of inventory. Under the LIFO cost flow assumption, the inventory will be valued at the older costs, since the more recent costs are assumed to be the first costs to flow out of inventory.",what
What is the difference between Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes?,"Social Security Payroll Tax
The Social Security payroll tax is 6.2% and is based on each employee's earnings (including wages, salaries, bonuses, commissions, etc.) up to a specified annual ceiling, limit, or maximum.
In the calendar year 2019, the Social Security payroll tax rate of 6.2% is applied to each employee's earnings up to the maximum of $132,900. The 6.2% that is withheld from the employee is also matched by the employer. As a result, the total Social Security tax in 2019 for an employee is equal to 12.4% of each employee's annual earnings up to a maximum earnings amount of $132,900.
In the calendar year 2020, the Social Security payroll tax rate of 6.2% is applied to each employee's earnings up to the maximum of $137,700. The 6.2% that is withheld from the employee is also matched by the employer. As a result, the total Social Security tax in 2020 for an employee is equal to 12.4% of each employee's annual earnings up to a maximum earnings amount of $137,700.
Medicare Payroll Tax
The Medicare payroll tax is 1.45% and is based on each employee's earnings without limit. The Medicare tax is withheld from each employee's earnings and is also matched by the employer. This makes the total Medicare tax equal to 2.9% on every dollar of earnings. (There is also an Additional Medicare Tax for high income employees and self-employed individuals. However, the Additional Medicare Tax is not matched by the employer.)
FICA Payroll Tax
The combination of Social Security taxes and Medicare taxes is referred to as FICA. We often refer to the FICA tax rate as 7.65% (6.2% Social Security + 1.45% Medicare) of each employee's first $132,900 of annual earnings in 2019 and the first $137,700 of annual earnings in 2020. Each employee's earnings in excess of the annual ceiling amount are taxed only for Medicare at 1.45% for the employee and 1.45% for the employer. (There is also an Additional Medicare Tax that is withheld from high income employees' pay, but the employer does not match the Additional Medicare Tax amounts.)
Self-employed persons are responsible for both the employee and employer portions.
Social Security involves retirement and disability benefits. Medicare involves health care for people 65 years of age and older.",what
What is the entry for the down payment from a signed contract?,"A down payment received before it is earned is recorded with a debit to the current asset account Cash and a credit to the current liability account Customer Deposits.
When the contract is completed, the account Customer Deposits will be debited for the amount of the down payment, the sale will be recorded with a credit, and Cash or Accounts Receivable will be debited.",what
How much do you depreciate an asset and when?,"Depreciation begins when you place an asset in service and it ends when you take an asset out of service or when you have expensed its cost, whichever comes first.
For financial statements, you are guided by the matching principle. The objective is to match the cost of the asset to the accounting periods in which revenues were earned by using the asset. There are two estimates needed: 1) the number of years that the asset will be used, and 2) the salvage value at the end of the asset's use. If an asset has a cost of $100,000 and is expected to be used for 10 years and then have no salvage value, most companies will depreciate the asset at the rate of $10,000 per year. This is known as the straight line method of depreciation.
For income tax purposes in the U.S., the Internal Revenue Service has determined the number of years that various assets will be useful and it assumes there will be no salvage value. The IRS also allows companies to take larger depreciation deductions in the earlier years and smaller deductions in the later years of the assets' lives. This is known as accelerated depreciation.
As you probably noted from the above information, in any one year the depreciation expense on the financial statements will be different from the depreciation expense on the income tax return. However, over the life of an asset, the total depreciation expense will be the same. Accountants refer to this as a timing difference.",what
Why is the distinction between product costs and period costs important?,"The distinction between product costs and period costs is important to:

Properly measure a company's net income during the time specified on its income statement, and
To report the proper cost of inventory on the balance sheet

Definition of Product Costs
Product costs include the costs to manufacture products or to purchase products. If a product is unsold, the product costs will be reported as inventory on the balance sheet. When the product is sold, its cost is removed from inventory and will be included on the income statement as the cost of goods sold. Product costs are also referred to as inventoriable costs.
Examples of Product Costs
The product costs for a retailer will be the amount paid to the supplier plus any freight-in. Product costs for a manufacturer will be the direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead used to manufacture a product.
Definition of Period Costs
Period costs are expenses that will be reported on the income statement without ever attaching to products. Since they are not product costs, period costs will not be included in the cost of inventory. Instead, period costs will be referred to as period expenses since they will be reported on the income statement as selling, general and administrative (SG&A) or interest expenses.
Example of Period Costs
Selling expenses (such as commissions, salaries of sales employees, advertising), general and administrative (general office salaries, rent, utilities, etc.), and interest expense will be reported on the income statement when they are directly related to sales or when they are used up. For example, the insurance premiums that a company pays for nonmanufacturing protection will be expensed in the period in which the insurance premiums expire. (However, the insurance premiums for the manufacturing operations will become part of the product costs as the insurance premiums expire.)",what
What are gross sales?,"Gross sales are the amounts a company earned and recorded from the sales of its products (and perhaps its services). The amounts originate from the company's sales invoices but the total will be adjusted to the accrual basis at the end of each accounting period.
The gross sales amounts from the sales invoices are recorded in a general ledger account such as Sales. (Any sales returns, sales allowances, and sales discounts should be recorded in separate contra revenue accounts in order for management to see the magnitude of these items.)
Gross sales is also defined as the sales revenues before deducting the sales returns, sales allowances, and sales discounts. (Gross sales minus sales returns, sales allowances, and sales discounts is the definition of net sales.)
A review of the income statement for 19 publicly-traded corporations revealed that only the net amount of sales (or revenues) appeared on the face of the income statements.",what
How do you record the sale of land?,"If a company sells land that it was holding for future use, the company will 1) debit Cash for the amount it receives, 2) credit Land for the amount in the general ledger account that applies to the land being sold, and 3) record the difference as a gain or loss on sale of land.
Since land does not get depreciated, there is no depreciation expense to be recorded up to the date of the sale, nor is there any accumulated depreciation to be removed from the books of the company.",what
What is turnover?,"Turnover is used in some countries to mean sales.
Turnover is also used in certain financial ratios. For example, the inventory turnover ratio is calculated by dividing the cost of goods sold during a year by the average inventory during the same year. The accounts receivable turnover ratio is computed by dividing the credit sales during a year by the average balance in Accounts Receivable during the same year.",what
What is contained on a 10-column worksheet?,"The 10-column worksheet that I am familiar with will have the general ledger account titles in the first column followed by ten columns of amounts. There will be one debit and one credit column for each of the following five headings:

Trial Balance containing each account's unadjusted balance,
Adjustments containing any adjusting entries,
Adjusted Trial Balance containing the combination of the unadjusted balance and any adjustments,
Income Statement containing the adjusted balances for the revenue, expense, gain and loss accounts, and
Balance Sheet containing the adjusted balances for the asset, liability and owner's equity accounts.

Under the Income Statement columns, the difference between the total of the debit column and the credit column is the amount of net income or net loss. If the total of the credit column is larger than the total of the debit column, it indicates a positive net income (revenues are greater than expenses). If the total of the debit column is larger than the total of the credit column it indicates a net loss (expenses are greater than revenues).",what
Why is the accuracy of inventory valuation so important?,"Having an accurate valuation of inventory is important because the reported amount of inventory will affect 1) the cost of goods sold, gross profit, and net income on the income statement, and 2) the amount of current assets, working capital, total assets, and stockholders' or owner's equity reported on the balance sheet. In fact, an incorrect inventory valuation will cause two income statements to be incorrect. The reason is the ending inventory of one accounting period will automatically become the beginning inventory in the subsequent accounting period.",what
What is FICA?,"Definition of FICA
FICA is the acronym for Federal Insurance Contributions Act. FICA refers to the combination of the U.S. Social Security payroll tax and the Medicare payroll tax.
For the calendar year 2019, the FICA payroll tax consists of:

 The Social Security tax of 6.2% withheld from the first $132,900 of each employee's earnings (wages, salaries, etc.) in the year 2019 (January 1 through December 31, 2019).
 The Medicare tax of 1.45% withheld from the total amount of an employee's 2019 earnings. (There is no earnings cap or limit for the Medicare tax.)

For the calendar year 2020, the FICA payroll tax consists of:

 The Social Security tax of 6.2% withheld from the first $137,700 of each employee's earnings in the year 2020 (January 1 through December 31, 2020).
 The Medicare tax of 1.45% withheld from the total amount of an employee's 2020 earnings. (There is no earnings cap or limit for the Medicare tax.)

FICA is Paid by Employees and Employer
In addition, the employer must match the FICA taxes withheld from its employees. This means that the employer will have an additional expense equal to the total of the FICA taxes withheld from its employees (except that the employer does not match the Additional Medicare Tax). The employer has the responsibility to remit to the federal government both the FICA that was withheld from its employees plus the employer's matching amount.
A self-employed person must pay both the employee portion and the employer portion of the FICA tax.
Additional Information on FICA
The earnings wage limits and rates for other years as well as information on the Additional Medicare Tax for higher income taxpayers can be found on IRS.gov.",what
What is the bookkeeping equation?,"The bookkeeping equation for a sole proprietorship is assets = liabilities + owner's equity. The bookkeeping equation for a corporation is assets = liabilities + stockholders' equity. The bookkeeping equation is also referred to as the accounting equation.
In the bookkeeping equation:

assets are the resources owned by the business
liabilities are the amounts the business owes
owner's equity is the amount the owner invested plus the net income of the business minus the amounts the owner withdrew for personal use (all since the business began)

Often it is said that the liabilities and owner's equity are the claims against the assets. It can also be said that the liabilities and the owner's equity are the sources of the assets.
The bookkeeping equation should always be in balance because of double-entry bookkeeping.
To learn more about the bookkeeping or accounting equation, see our Explanation, Quiz, and more.",what
What are accrued liabilities?,"Definition of Accrued Liabilities
Accrued liabilities are usually expenses that have been incurred by a company as of the end of an accounting period, but the amounts have not yet been paid or recorded in the general ledger.
Accrued liabilities are recorded at the end of the accounting period by means of  adjusting entries. The amounts for some accrued liabilities and their related expenses (or losses) may have to be estimated.
Examples of Accrued Liabilities
Some examples of accrued liabilities include the following:

Services and purchases that have been received, but the vendors' invoices have not yet been recorded in Accounts Payable
Accrued employee wages and fringe benefits
Accrued management bonuses
Accrued interest on loans payable
Accrued advertising and promotion
Accrued product warranty costs",what
What does it mean to reclassify an amount?,"To reclassify an amount often means to move an amount from one general ledger account to another general ledger account.
To illustrate, let's assume that an invoice for $900 was recorded in the account Advertising Expenses. Upon review, the advertising manager informs the accountant that the amount should have been recorded in the account Marketing Supplies. If the accountant uses a journal entry to move the amount, the entry's description might be: To reclassify $900 from Advertising Expense to Marketing Supplies.
In this illustration, the phrase to reclassify an amount has a gentler tone than the phrase to correct an account coding error.",what
What is a sole proprietorship?,"A sole proprietorship is a form of business organization that is owned by one person. The owner is referred to as a sole proprietor.
In accounting, the balance sheet of the sole proprietorship reflects the accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity. Owner's Equity consists of the owner's capital account and also a drawing account. The drawing account is a temporary account in which the owner's current year draws or withdrawals are recorded. (The sole proprietor has draws because he or she does not receive a salary or wages. Hence, the income statement will not report an expense for the owner's work. This means that the net income reflects the total return for the owner's work and investment.)
A sole proprietorship is not legally separate from its owner (as would be the case with a corporation). However, a sole proprietor may be able to register as a limited liability company in order to limit his or her personal liability. Be sure to seek professional advice as to the appropriate form of business for your situation and location.",what
What is an uncleared cheque?,"An uncleared cheque is a cheque that has been written and recorded in the payer's records, but the cheque has not yet been paid by the bank on which it is drawn. In the U.S. accounting textbooks, an uncleared cheque is referred to as an outstanding check.
In the bank reconciliation process an uncleared cheque (or outstanding check) is deducted from the balance shown on the bank statement to arrive at the correct or adjusted balance per bank.",what
What is the entry when a company lends money to an employee?,"When a company lends cash to one of its employees, the entry will include a credit to Cash and a debit to an asset account such as Notes Receivable from Employees (if a promissory note is involved) or Other Receivables-Advances to Employees (if a note is not involved).
When the company earns interest on the loan, the interest should be credited to Interest Revenue or Interest Income and should be debited to Interest Receivable or Cash.",what
How do I start a petty cash fund?,"To start a petty cash fund you need to open a general ledger account entitled Petty Cash. This will be an additional cash account that you could report either separately or have its balance included with other cash accounts when preparing a balance sheet.
Next you need to write a check for the amount that you believe is the amount needed for making small payments in your office. Let's assume that the amount will be $100. When processing the check you would indicate the account code for Petty Cash, so that the new account will be debited for $100.
You also need to designate one person to be the petty cash custodian. This person's name will be the payee of the $100 check. This person will then be accountable for the $100. At all times the custodian must have a combination of cash and petty cash receipts which add up to $100.
Just prior to issuing financial statements, the petty cash custodian should request cash for the petty cash receipts. This is known as replenishing the petty cash fund. This allows for the expenses to be included in the income statement and will result in the custodian having the $100 of cash that will be reported in the balance sheet. The custodian can also replenish the petty cash fund when there is little cash on hand due to a large amount of petty cash payments.",what
How do you record a deposit on utilities?,"A deposit on utilities is recorded with a debit to the asset account Utilities Deposit and a credit to the asset account Cash. The account Utilities Deposit will be reported as a current asset if the company expects the amount to be returned by the utilities within one year of the balance sheet date. If the deposit will not be returned within one year of the balance sheet date, it will be reported as a long-term asset.",what
"In accounting, what is the meaning of cr.?","In accounting, cr. is the abbreviation for credit.
In accounting and in bookkeeping, credit or cr. indicates an entry on the right side of a general ledger account.
Credit entries will increase the credit balances that are typical for liability, revenues, and stockholders' equity accounts. Credit entries will also decrease the debit balances usually found in asset and expense accounts.",what
When do you adjust the amount of prepaid expenses?,"The balance in the current asset account Prepaid Expenses should be adjusted prior to issuing a company's financial statements. If the company issues financial statements for each calendar month, you will need to adjust the balance in Prepaid Expenses as of the end of each month. If your company issues only quarterly financial statements, you will need to adjust the balance at the end of each quarter.
The goal is to have the balance in Prepaid Expenses be equal to the amount of the unexpired costs as of the end of the accounting period (which is also the date appearing in the heading of the balance sheet).
Usually the adjusting entry for prepaid expenses will be a credit to Prepaid Expenses and a debit to the appropriate expense account(s). For instance, if Prepaid Expenses involve the prepayment of insurance premiums the adjusting entry will include a debit to Insurance Expense.",what
Is the reversal of a previous year's accrued expense permanent?,"Yes, a reversing entry is permanent.
To illustrate, let's assume that a company had accrued interest expense of $10,000 as of December 31, the end of its accounting year. The accrual adjusting entry will record an additional $10,000 of expense to be reported on the December income statement and an additional $10,000 liability on the December 31 balance sheet.
On January 1 the account Interest Expense will begin with a zero balance, since expenses are temporary accounts that are closed at the end of each accounting year. On January 2, a reversing entry is recoded which removes the $10,000 liability and causes a $10,000 credit balance in Interest Expense. The negative amount in Interest Expense will disappear as soon as the interest portion of the January loan payment is recorded.
The accrual entry on December 31 was needed only for the December financial statements. Early in January the December 31 accrued interest must be permanently removed or reversed because the actual interest will soon be recorded. The reversing entry will assure that the interest expense amount is reported only once.",what
What is the difference between loan interest and bank loan repayment?,"I would describe loan interest to be the bank's return on the money it has lent to a borrower. Interest is the amount the bank has earned and charges for the use of the money it has lent.
I would describe a bank loan repayment to be the return of the money that the bank has lent. In other words, I assume that a loan repayment refers to the principal payment (and not the total payment or the interest payment). Not everyone necessarily uses the terminology in the same way.
When a borrower makes a loan payment (as opposed to a loan repayment), it is likely that the bank will first collect the interest it is owed. Any remainder between the total payment and the interest payment will be applied to the loan's principal balance.",what
"Is contributed capital a noncurrent asset or a current asset, and is it a debit or credit?","The account Contributed Capital is part of stockholders' equity and it will have a credit balance. Contributed capital is also referred to as paid-in capital.
When a corporation issues shares of its stock for cash, the corporation's current asset Cash will increase with the debit part of the entry, and the account Contributed Capital will increase with the credit part of the entry. If the corporation then uses some of its cash to purchase equipment, its current asset Cash will decrease and its noncurrent asset Equipment will increase.
If a corporation receives equipment in exchange for newly issued shares of stock, the noncurrent asset Equipment will increase and Contributed Capital will increase.",what
What is an asset account?,"Definition of an Asset Account
An asset account is a general ledger account used to sort and store the debit and credit amounts from a company's transactions involving the company's resources.
The balances in the asset accounts will be summarized and reported on the company's balance sheet.
Generally, the asset account balances are debit balances and are increased with a debit entry and decreased with a credit entry.
Examples of Asset Accounts
Some examples of asset accounts include Cash, Accounts Receivable, Inventory, Prepaid Expenses, Investments, Buildings, Equipment, Vehicles, Goodwill, and many more.
Two asset accounts, Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Accumulated Depreciation, are known as contra asset accounts since these accounts are expected to have credit balances.
Asset Accounts Are Permanent or Real Accounts
Asset accounts are referred to as permanent or real accounts since they are not closed at the end of the accounting year. Instead, each asset account's balance at the end of the accounting year is carried forward to become the beginning balance of the next accounting year.",what
What is the difference between reserve and allowance?,"More than 60 years ago, accountants in the U.S. used Reserve for Bad Debts as the title of the contra account associated with Accounts Receivable or Loans Receivable. They also used Reserve for Depreciation as the title of the contra account associated with plant assets. The use of the word reserve led some readers of the financial statements to conclude that money was set aside for replacing plant assets or the uncollectible accounts or loans. To avoid this misunderstanding, the accounting profession recommended that the word reserve have a very limited use. Accountants now use Allowance for Doubtful Accounts or Allowance for Bad Debts instead of Reserve for Bad Debts. In the case of plant assets, Accumulated Depreciation is used in place of Reserve for Depreciation.",what

(AccountingCoach is not affiliated with QuickBooks, Intuit, or Lynda.com and does not receive any affiliate income from them.)",what
What is accelerated depreciation?,"Accelerated depreciation is the allocation of a plant asset's cost in a faster manner than the straight line depreciation. Compared to straight line depreciation, accelerated depreciation will mean 1) more depreciation in the earlier years of an asset's life and 2) less depreciation in the later years of the asset's life. [Note that the total amount of depreciation over the asset's life will be the same regardless of the depreciation method used.] Hence, the difference between accelerated depreciation and straight line depreciation is the timing of the depreciation.
Three examples of accelerated depreciation methods include double-declining (200% declining) balance, 150% declining balance, and sum-of-the-years' digits (SYD).
The U.S. income tax regulations allow a business to use accelerated depreciation on its income tax return while using straight line depreciation on its financial statements. For profitable corporations this will likely result in deferred income tax payments being reported on its financial statements.",what
How do the income statements of a sole proprietorship and a regular corporation differ?,"The income statement of a sole proprietorship will not report any salary expense for the sole proprietor who works in the business. However, if the business is a regular corporation, the income statement will report as salary expense the amount that the stockholder earned by working in the business.
Another difference involves income tax expense. The income statement of a sole proprietorship will not report income tax expense, since the owner (and not the business) is responsible for U.S. income taxes. On the other hand, a regular corporation is a taxpaying entity and it is responsible for U.S. income taxes.
As a result of these two differences, the net income (which is the bottom line of the income statements) will be different. In the case of the sole proprietorship, the net income is the total amount that the owner has earned before income taxes for 1) the capital invested in the business and 2) the owner's compensation for working in the business. In the case of a regular corporation owned by one person, the owner has earned the salary (which was included in salary expense on the income statement) and has also earned the reported amount of net income or net loss.
Neither the draws made by the sole proprietor nor the dividends distributed by a regular corporation are reported on the income statement.",what
What are wages payable?,"Definition of Wages Payable
Wages payable refers to the wages that a company's employees have earned, but have not yet been paid. Under the accrual method of accounting, this amount is likely recorded with an adjusting entry at the end of the accounting period so that the company's balance sheet will include the amount as a current liability. (The adjusting entry typically debits Wages Expense and credits Wages Payable.)
Example of Wages Payable
To illustrate wages payable we will use the following hypothetical dates and other information. Jane is an hourly-paid sales clerk at a company that ends its accounting year on December 31. During the work week of Sunday December 22 through Saturday December 28 Jane earned $400 of wages that the company will pay to her on January 2. For the last three days of the year (December 29-31) Jane earned $160. This amount (plus any wages she earns from January 1-4) will be included in her January 9 paycheck.
Given this information, the company has wages payable of $560 ($400 + $160) as of December 31.
Reporting Wages Payable on the Balance Sheet
The company's current liabilities on its December 31 balance sheet must include the $560 of wages payable that Jane had earned and the company owes as of December 31. (The company's income statement for the year that ends on December 31 must also report the $560 as part of its wages expense.)
The amount in the account Wages Payable (or Accrued Wages Payable) will often be reported on the balance sheet as part of a current liability description such as accrued compensation, accrued payroll liabilities, accrued expenses, accrued liabilities, etc.",what
What is the chart of accounts?,"The chart of accounts is a listing of the general ledger accounts to which amounts can be posted. The chart of accounts is a helpful tool for identifying the best account for recording a transaction.
In some accounting software the chart of accounts may be the means to open new general ledger accounts and to control their position in the financial statements.
Usually the chart of accounts begins with the balance sheet accounts followed by the income statement accounts. The accounts will usually be in the same order as they are presented on the two financial statements.",what
Where do I record the refund of a registration fee?,"If the registration fee refers to a fee expense that you had originally paid but the amount is now being refunded to you, I would credit the same expense account that you had originally charged or debited, and would debit Cash.
If the registration fee refers to an amount you are refunding because someone had originally registered for one of your programs, I would 1) credit Cash for the amount you are paying out as the refund, and 2) debit a contra-revenue account such as Refunds of Registration Fee Revenues. This will allow you to easily track the total amounts of refunds that you make during a year. On the other hand, if it is rare for your organization to refund registration fees, you could simply 1) debit the amount you are refunding to the normal revenue account such as Registration Fee Revenues, and 2) credit Cash.",what
What are payroll withholding taxes?,"In the U.S. payroll withholding taxes are the taxes that an employer is required to deduct from its employees' gross wages, salaries, bonuses, and other compensation.
The typical payroll withholding taxes include each employee's portion of the Social Security and Medicare taxes (also referred to as FICA), federal income tax, and often state income tax. (A few cities and states may also require additional payroll taxes.)
After deducting the payroll withholding taxes from its employees, the employer is required to remit the amounts in a timely manner to the appropriate government.
In addition to payroll withholding taxes, most employers also withhold nontax amounts for insurances, savings plans, union dues, court-ordered garnishments, and so on.",what
What is float?,"In accounting and bookkeeping, float is the time between the writing of a check and the time that the check clears the bank account on which it is drawn.
For example, Payer Corporation writes a check for $5,000 and mails it to a supplier on Wednesday. However, the check will not clear Payer Corporation's checking account until Monday. Hence, Payer Corporation will have $5,000 of float between Wednesday and Monday.
Mary plays the float when she mails her rent check on Thursday even though she does not have a sufficient balance in her personal checking account. She is counting on her paycheck being electronically deposited on Monday morning prior to her rent check clearing her checking account.
Float is associated with the outstanding checks shown on the bank reconciliation.",what
Is the sale of a plant asset recorded in the sales account?,"The sale of a plant asset should not be recorded in the sales account. The sales account is used to report a retailer's sale of merchandise or a manufacturer's sale of products. In other words, sales result from a company's main revenue producing activities.
The sale of a plant asset is a ""peripheral"" activity and does not qualify as sales revenues. Rather, the gain or loss on a sale of a plant asset is reported on the income statement as a separate item. Often this item is included in a section labeled as ""other"" or ""nonoperating."" (The gain or loss is the difference between the proceeds from the sale of the plant asset and the plant asset's carrying value at the time of the sale.)
The proceeds from the sale of the plant asset is reported as a positive amount in the investing activities section of the statement of cash flows.",what
What is the segregation of duties?,"The segregation of duties is associated with the safeguarding of an organization's assets and the topic known as internal control.
An example of the segregation of duties would be a company's requirement that the bank statement for its checking account must be reconciled by someone other than a person writing checks and someone other than a person recording amounts in the company's general ledger.
Another example of the segregation of duties is that the person handling cash cannot be the same person that records cash amounts in the company's ledgers.
By segregating or separating the duties, it becomes harder for dishonest actions to go undetected.",what
What are accrual adjusting entries?,"Definition of Accrual Adjusting Entries
Accrual adjusting entries or simply accruals are one of three types of adjusting entries which are prepared at the end of an accounting period so that a company's financial statements will comply with the accrual method of accounting. Expressed another way, accrual adjusting entries are the means for including transactions that occurred during the current accounting period but have not yet been recorded in a company's general ledger accounts. Without accrual adjusting entries those transactions will likely be reported in a later accounting period. This means that the financial statements for two accounting periods will be reporting incorrect amounts.
Example of an Accrual Adjusting Entry for Expenses
To illustrate, let's assume that New Corp begins its business on December 1 and uses Sales Rep Company for calling on customers. For this service, New Corp agrees to pay commissions of 5% of sales with payment made 10 days after the month ends. Assuming that December's sales are $100,000 New Corp will be incurring commissions expense of $5,000 and a liability of $5,000. However, the payment will actually occur on January 10. Without an accrual adjusting entry as of December 31 New Corp's financial statements will have the following problems:

Its December income statement will report $0 commissions expense in getting December's sales of $100,000
Its January income statement will report $5,000 in commissions expense that were actually incurred in order to get December's sales
Its December 31 balance sheet will not be reporting its $5,000 liability to Sales Rep Company

In order for New Corp's December's income statement to match the $5,000 of commissions expense with December's sales of $100,000, and for New Corp's December 31 balance sheet to report the liability of $5,000, the following accrual adjusting entry is needed as of December 31: debit Commissions Expense for $5,000; credit Commissions Payable for $5,000.
Example of an Accrual Adjusting Entry for Revenues
Over at Sales Rep Company, for its financial statements to comply with the accrual method of accounting it needs to record the following accrual adjusting entry as of December 31 (assuming its billing will take place in early January): debit the asset account Commissions Receivable for $5,000; credit Commissions Revenues for $5,000. Without this accrual entry as of December 31, Sales Rep Company's December financial statements will have the following problems:

Its December income statement will report $0 in revenues that were earned from representing New Corp during December
Its January income statement will report $5,000 in revenues that were actually earned in December when Sales Rep Company was incurring expenses in order to make the sales calls
Its December 31 balance sheet will not be reporting the receivable of $5,000 that it has a right to receive for its December's efforts

Since accrual adjusting entries will be followed by the actual transactions (checks written, billing invoices issued, etc.), a helpful accounting procedure is to record reversing entries on the first day of the next accounting period.",what
What is a special journal?,"Definition of a Special Journal
A special journal (also known as a specialized journal) is useful in a manual accounting or bookkeeping system to reduce the tedious task of recording both the debit and credit general ledger account names and amounts in a general journal.
Example of a Special Journal
One example of a special journal is the sales journal which is used exclusively for a company’s sales of merchandise to customers that are allowed to pay at a future date. The sales journal will have only one column in which to enter the amount of each sales invoice. At the end of the month the total of the column is debited to Accounts Receivable and credited to Sales. Throughout the month, the individual sales invoices will be posted to each customer’s record found in the company’s subsidiary ledger for Accounts Receivable. 
The benefits of using a special journal instead of the general journal for the repetitive transactions have been eliminated with today’s inexpensive yet powerful accounting software. For example, when a sales invoice is prepared by using accounting software, both the general ledger and subsidiary accounts will be updated instantly and accurately.
More Examples of Special Journals
In addition to the sales journal (used for recording sales on credit), there are other special journals which were popular in manual accounting systems. The following special journals were more efficient than recording all transactions in the general journal:

Cash disbursement journal for recording checks written.
Cash receipts journal for recording cash sales and other money received.
Purchases journal for recording purchases on credit of goods to be resold. (Cash purchases are recorded in the cash disbursement journal. Purchases of items such as equipment are recorded in the general journal.)",what
Why will some asset accounts have a credit balance?,"A few asset accounts intentionally have credit balances. For instance, the account Accumulated Depreciation (which is a plant asset account) will have a credit balance since it is credited for the amounts that are debited to Depreciation Expense. The account Allowance for Bad Debts will have a credit balance for the amounts in Accounts Receivable that are not likely to be collected. The accounts Accumulated Depreciation and Allowance for Bad Debts are referred to as contra asset accounts because their credit balances are contrary to the expected debit balances found in most asset accounts.
There are also unexpected situations that result in asset accounts having credit balances. Here are five examples:

An error caused by posting an amount to an incorrect account.
Continuing to depreciate or amortize an asset after its balance has reached zero.
Receiving and posting an amount that was greater than the recorded receivable.
Expenses occurred faster than the agreed upon prepayments.
The amount of checks written exceeded the positive amount in the Cash account.

Before issuing the balance sheet, any errors (such as items 1 and 2) need to be corrected. The accounts with credit balances in items 3, 4, and 5 need to be reclassified to the liability section of the balance sheet.",what
What are nonmanufacturing overhead costs?,"Nonmanufacturing overhead costs are the business expenses that are outside of a company's manufacturing operations. These are often referred to as the selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses plus the company's interest expense. Examples of the nonmanufacturing overhead costs include the salaries and other expenses for the following business activities: selling, distribution, marketing, finance, IT, human resources, legal, and so on. (We have additional examples within our AccountingCoach.com topic Nonmanufacturing Overhead.)
Since these costs are outside of the manufacturing function, they are not considered to be costs of the products. As a result, the nonmanufacturing costs are not allocated to the products for determining the costs for inventory or for the cost of goods sold. Instead, the nonmanufacturing costs are immediately expensed in the accounting period in which they are incurred. That is why accountants say that the nonmanufacturing costs are period costs or period expenses. (Only the manufacturing costs of direct materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead are product costs.)
While the nonmanufacturing overhead costs are not allocated to the products, the company must have its selling prices and sales revenues sufficient to cover both the product costs and the period expenses in order to avoid a negative net income.",what
What is the definition of net sales?,"The definition of net sales is sales minus sales discounts, sales returns, and sales allowances.",what
What is the difference between an adjunct account and a contra account?,"Let's illustrate adjunct and contra accounts with bonds payable. If a corporation issues $100,000 of its bonds payable for a price of 97, it will be issuing the bonds at a discount of 3%. Its journal entry will include a debit to Cash for $97,000; a credit to Bonds Payable for $100,000; and a debit to Discount on Bonds Payable for $3,000. Discount on Bonds Payable is a contra account because it is a liability account with a debit amount. The carrying value of the bonds will begin at $97,000 since the $100,000 in Bonds Payable is offset by the $3,000 debit in Discount on Bonds Payable.
If a corporation issues $300,000 of bonds at a price of 102, it will be issuing the bonds at a premium of 2%. The journal entry will include a debit to Cash for $306,000; a credit to Bonds Payable for $300,000; and a credit to Premium on Bonds Payable for $6,000. Since a credit balance is the normal balance for a liability account, the account Premium on Bonds Payable cannot be referred to as a contra account. Here is where the term adjunct account is used. Immediately after the bonds are issued, the bonds will have a carrying value of $306,000 ($300,000 PLUS $6,000).
Some people might use the term adjunct accounts for both the Discount on Bonds Payable and for the Premium on Bonds Payable. Others might use the term valuation accounts.
Other examples of contra accounts include Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, Accumulated Depreciation, Discount on Notes Payable, Bond Issue Costs, Discount on Notes Receivable, LIFO Reserve, and certain investment accounts.",what
Should a cash discount be recorded as a reduction to an expense?,"Yes, a cash discount should be a reduction to an expense. After all, accountants  define cost as the cash amount (or cash equivalent amount) at the time of the transaction.
To illustrate, let's assume that your company receives marketing consulting services and is billed $10,000 with terms of 1/10, net 30. If the bill is paid within 10 days, the cost is $9,900 ($10,000 minus the 1% discount of $100). This means that Cash should be credited for $9,900 and that the account Marketing Consulting Expenses should be debited $9,900. The cost of the marketing services was the cash price of $9,900.
It would be wrong to record $10,000 as a debit  to Marketing Consulting Expenses and to record a credit  of $100 in the account Cash Discounts. The reason is that the Cash Discounts is usually intended to be a contra account for Purchases, which is used by companies that purchase goods for resale.",what
What is an unpresented check?,"An unpresented check is a check written by a company and entered in its records, but the check has not yet cleared the company's checking account. In other words, the check has not yet been paid by the bank on which the check is drawn. An unpresented check is also known as an outstanding check.
An unpresented check is listed on a bank reconciliation as a subtraction from the bank balance.",what
Why doesn't the balance sheet equal the post-closing trial balance?,"The totals on the balance sheet will not equal the totals on the post-closing trial balance due to contra accounts. We will use  the contra account  Accumulated Depreciation to illustrate why this occurs.
The account Accumulated Depreciation will have a credit balance and it will be listed in the credit column of the trial balance. Its credit balance will be included with the other credit balances, most of which are liability accounts and owner or stockholder equity accounts.
On the balance sheet, the credit balance in Accumulated Depreciation will not be reported with the other credit balances. Rather, the credit balance in Accumulated Depreciation will be a deduction from the debit balances reported in the asset section entitled property, plant and equipment.",what
What is a mortgage loan?,"A mortgage loan is a loan with a lien on real estate so that the lender has collateral until the loan is repaid. On any given date, the borrower is liable for the unpaid principal balance plus any accrued interest expense up to that point. It is common for mortgage loans to require monthly interest and principal payments that will repay the principal balance over a number of years.
In accounting, the borrower's balance sheet will report a current liability for 1) the principal payments that will be coming due within one year after the balance sheet date, and 2) any accrued interest that is owed as of the balance sheet date. (Interest for future accounting periods is not reported as a liability.)
The borrower's balance sheet will also report a noncurrent liability for the difference between 1) the total unpaid principal balance owed as of the date of the balance sheet, minus 2) the principal payments that are reported as a current liability.
The lender's balance sheet will report a current asset and a noncurrent asset for the principal balance receivable and any accrued interest receivable. These amounts will be symmetrical to the amounts reported as liabilities on the borrower's balance sheet for the same date.",what
Why does a company debit Purchases instead of Inventory?,"Under the periodic inventory system a company determines its inventory value based on an estimated or actual physical count of goods multiplied by the unit costs of the items. As a result, the costs of the goods purchased by the company will be debited to the temporary account Purchases. Under the periodic inventory system, there will also be temporary accounts that will be credited for Purchase Returns and Allowances and for Purchase Discounts.
If a company wants its Inventory account to have a running dollar amount, it will use the perpetual inventory system. Under the perpetual inventory system, the costs of the goods purchased are debited to Inventory. The perpetual system also requires that the Inventory account be credited for the cost of the goods sold, for purchase returns and allowances, and for purchase discounts.",what
What is a provision for discounts allowable?,"The provision for discounts allowable is likely to be a balance sheet account that serves to reduce the asset account Accounts Receivable. The provision account's counter part (remember double entry accounting) is an income statement account, such as Sales Discounts or Discounts for xxx.
Let me give you an example from the meat industry. We had 40,000 pounds of beef without a local customer, so we sold it to a company 1,000 miles away for the local price of say $1.50 per pound. Our accounting entry was to debit Accounts Receivable $60,000 and to credit Sales $60,000. We also knew that the beef would shrink approximately 800 pounds as it traveled in the refrigerated truck and that the customer would deduct $1,200 (800 pounds X $1.50) when the customer processed and paid our invoice. In order to more accurately report our Accounts Receivables, our Net Sales and our weekly profit, I immediately made an entry to debit Discount for Shrinkage (a contra account to Sales) and a credit to Provision for Discounts (a contra account to Accounts Receivable). By recording that entry, our balance sheet would report the true amount to be collected, $58,800 ($60,000 invoiced minus the anticipated deduction of $1,200). The income statement would report that Sales minus the discount were only $58,800.
The provision account allowed our Accounts Receivable to agree with our sales invoices, yet the balance sheet would report the net amount that we would realistically receive. It allowed us to ""match"" the discount to the week of the sale and not mismatch the discount to a later week when the customer remitted the reduced amount.",what
What is net?,"In accounting, net usually refers to the combination of positive and negative amounts. For example, the amount of net sales is the combination of the amount of gross sales (a positive amount) and some negative amounts such as sales returns, sales allowances, and sales discounts. Hence, if gross sales are 990 and sales returns are 10, sales allowances are 5, and sales discounts 20, the net sales are 955 (990 minus 35).
Here are some additional examples of net:

net realizable value. The amount to be received in the ordinary course of business minus the costs of completion and disposal.
net property, plant and equipment. The recorded costs of the tangible noncurrent assets used in the business minus the related accumulated depreciation.
accounts receivable, net. The recorded amount of accounts receivable minus the allowance for doubtful accounts.
net cash provided by operating activities. The combination of the cash inflows and the cash outflows from a company's operations (activities outside of its investing and financing activities).
loss on disposal, net of tax. An accounting loss on the sale of a business segment minus the income taxes that were saved (avoided, sheltered) because the loss was also deductible on the company's income tax return.
net income. Revenues and gains minus expenses and losses.",what
What is the employee's Social Security tax rate for 2019 and 2020?,"Social Security Payroll Tax for 2019
The employee's Social Security payroll tax rate for 2019 (January 1 through December 31, 2019) is 6.2% of the first $132,900 of wages, salaries, etc. An employee's 2019 earnings in excess of $132,900 are not subject to the Social Security tax.
Social Security Payroll Tax for 2020
The employee's Social Security payroll tax rate for 2020 (January 1 through December 31, 2020) is 6.2% of the first $137,700 of wages, salaries, etc. An employee's 2020 earnings in excess of $137,700 are not subject to the Social Security tax.
Social Security Payroll Tax is One Part of the FICA Payroll Tax
The Social Security payroll tax is one of the two components of the FICA payroll tax. The other component is the Medicare tax which applies to every dollar of an employee's earnings. In other words, there is no wage limit or cap for the Medicare tax. In fact, there is also an Additional Medicare Tax that applies to high income employees.
An Employer Must Match its Employees' FICA Taxes
In addition to the employees' Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes, the employer must match the amounts that were withheld from the employees' paychecks (except that the employer does not match the Additional Medicare Tax).",what
How should the cost of a yearly subscription for a newspaper be recorded?,"In theory, the payment in advance for a one-year subscription should initially be recorded as a debit to Prepaid Expenses and a credit to Cash. During the subscription period, you would debit Subscription Expense and would credit Prepaid Expenses. 
For example, if the annual subscription cost is $240 and it is paid in advance, you would initially debit Prepaid Expenses for $240 and credit Cash for $240. If your company issues monthly financial statements, then each month during the subscription period you would debit Subscription Expense for $20 and credit Prepaid Expenses for $20. This results in 1) the matching of $20 to expense on each of the monthly income statements, and 2) the balance sheet reporting the amount that is prepaid or not yet expired.
At a large company, the annual cost of $240 will usually be an immaterial amount. The materiality concept will allow you to violate the matching principle, and to avoid the monthly adjusting entry, by simply debiting Subscription Expense for the entire $240 at the beginning of the one-year subscription period.",what
What is a lease?,"A lease is usually a written agreement between an owner of property (land, building, equipment, vehicle, etc.) and a person or business that will use the property for a stated period of time at a specified series of payments.
The owner of the property is known as the lessor and the person using the property is the lessee.
Some leases are for short periods of time and there is no intention of transferring ownership of the asset in exchange for the rent payments. Two examples of this type of lease are 1) the lease for a one-bedroom apartment covering a 12-month period and rent payments of $1,100 per month, and 2) the lease of a new automobile for 24 months with payments of $300 per month.
Other leases may be for longer periods and ownership of the asset will transfer to the lessee for a small additional payment. An example is a noncancellable lease requiring 60 monthly payments of $600 per month for a forklift truck. At the end of the lease period (after the 60th payment) the lessee may take ownership of the forklift truck for an additional payment of $500.
Since leases are contracts requiring a series of payments, there is a question of how the lease and the related payments should be accounted for by the lessee and the lessor. As of September 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) were close to issuing a common financial accounting reporting standard that will replace the present U.S. accounting rules.",what
How do the responsibilities of a bookkeeper differ from those of an accountant?,"I see a bookkeeper's responsibilities as getting the business transactions into the company's general ledger. This involves a tremendous amount of accuracy and persistence in first getting the information and then getting it entered. At smaller companies the bookkeeper is likely to process the payables (receiving suppliers' invoices, verifying them, and remitting the amounts), receivables (billing customers, processing receipts, sending statements), payroll, and other tasks. In larger companies, the bookkeeper's responsibilities are likely to be assigned to an accounts payable clerk, an accounts receivable clerk, and a payroll clerk. Generally, the bookkeeper (or accounting clerks) will not have a four-year accounting degree and will be paid considerably less than an accountant.
Accountants will review the information that the bookkeeper had entered into the general ledger, will prepare adjusting entries, will prepare the financial statements, and will analyze them. The accountant will likely supervise the bookkeeper (or accounting clerks), will be involved in the accounting system, and will review the financial statements with the management and owners of the company. The accountant will also be involved in budgeting of operations and capital improvements, cost accounting, reports to government agencies, and various analyses required by management. Generally, the accountant will have a four-year or a five-year college degree with a major in accounting.
Of course my remarks are a broad generalization. Responsibilities will vary by company and by individual.",what
What is the employer's Social Security tax rate for 2019 and 2020?,"Employer's Social Security Payroll Tax for 2019
The employer's Social Security payroll tax rate for 2019 (January 1 through December 31, 2019) is the same as the employee's Social Security payroll tax: 6.2% of each employee's first $132,900 of wages, salaries, etc. If an employee's 2019 wages, salaries, etc. exceed $132,900, the amount in excess of $132,900 is not subject to the Social Security tax. Hence, the maximum amount of the employer's Social Security tax for each employee in 2019 is $8,239.80 (6.2% X $132,900).
Employer's Social Security Payroll Tax for 2020
The employer's Social Security payroll tax rate for 2020 (January 1 through December 31, 2020) is 6.2% of each employee's first $137,700 of wages, salaries, etc. (This amount is identical to the employee's Social Security tax that is withheld from the employee's wages, salaries, etc.) If an employee's wages, salaries, etc. are greater than $137,700, the amount in excess of $137,700 is not subject to the Social Security tax. Hence, the maximum amount of the employer's Social Security tax for each employee in 2020 is $8,537.40 (6.2% X $137,700).
Since employees also have the Social Security payroll tax withheld from their wages, salaries, etc., the employer is in effect matching each employee's Social Security payroll tax. The employer must remit both the amounts withheld from employees' wages and the employer's matching amount to the U.S. government.
Social Security Payroll Tax is One Part of the FICA Payroll Tax
In addition to the Social Security payroll tax, there is also a Medicare payroll tax of 1.45% and an Additional Medicare Tax for higher income taxpayers. (The combination of the Social Security tax and the Medicare tax is referred to as FICA.) The employer must match each employee's Medicare tax of 1.45% (but does not match the employee's Additional Medicare Tax). Information on the Additional Medicare Tax can be found at www.irs.gov.",what
What is not sufficient funds?,"Not sufficient funds or NSF is the term used to describe a check that has been returned by the bank on which it was drawn because the checking account balance was less than the amount of the check.
A check noted as not sufficient funds, NSF, or insufficient funds is also referred to as a returned check, a return item, a check that bounced, or as a rubber check since it was bounced back to the payee by the bank on which the check was drawn.
Checks returned as not sufficient funds usually result in bank charges for both the payee and for the person writing the check.
A check returned as not sufficient funds could be an indication that the financial condition of the maker of the check had declined. This could signal a potential credit loss if the maker of the check is a customer to which you extend credit terms on its purchases.",what
What is meant by accounts written off?,"Accounts written off often refers to the accounts receivable that were deemed to be uncollectible and were removed from a receivable account in the general ledger. For example, a manufacturer may have written off an accounts receivable because a customer filed for bankruptcy and has insufficient assets. In this situation the account balance is written off with 1) a credit to Accounts Receivable, and 2) a debit to Allowance for Doubtful Accounts or Bad Debts Expense.
Banks, credit card companies, hospitals, and other organizations will also remove uncollectible accounts from their receivables and will refer to them as accounts written off.",what
Why are some expenses deferred?,"Generally, expenses are deferred in order to comply with the accounting guideline known as the matching principle.
To illustrate the concept, let's assume that a company pays $3,000 on December 30 to rent a warehouse for the upcoming three-month period of January 1 through March 31. Since none of the $3,000 expires or is used up in December, none of the amount should be reported as rent expense on the income statement for the month of December. Hence the $3,000 is deferred to a balance sheet account such as Prepaid Rent (or Prepaid Expenses), which is a current asset account.
During the three months of January 1 through March 31 (when the prepaid rent is expiring) the $3,000 prepayment must be moved from the balance sheet asset account to an income statement expense account. The usual allocation will involve an adjusting entry to debit Rent Expense for $1,000 and credit Prepaid Rent for $1,000 on January 31, February 28 and March 31.",what
How many days after a month ends should the bank reconciliation be done?,"The bank reconciliation should be done within a few days after the month ends. The reasons include 1) making certain that the company's Cash account has the correct balance, and 2) making sure that the financial statements for the month include all of the company's transactions. At the latest, the bank reconciliation should be done prior to closing the books for the month.
The bank reconciliation might reveal that some revenues and/or receipts were electronically deposited into the bank account but were not yet recorded in the accounting records. Likewise, there might be some expenses and/or payments that were deducted electronically from the bank account, but were not yet entered into the company's accounts. Further, the bank reconciliation might reveal some errors in the transactions already recorded in the company's general ledger.
To save time and to improve internal control, have the bank reconciliation be performed by someone other than the person writing the checks and/or recording amounts in the general ledger.",what
How do I determine my payroll tax liabilities?,"Your payroll tax liabilities will include the following:

Federal, state, and local income taxes withheld from employees' wages, salaries, bonuses, etc. but not yet remitted.
The unremitted Social Security and Medicare taxes that were to be withheld plus your company's matching of those taxes.
State and federal unemployment taxes not yet remitted. Your state can tell you the rate for your company and the wages to which the rate applies. For example, it might be 5% on the first $9,000 of annual wages and salaries. The federal rate (after credit) is 0.6% on the first $7,000 of annual wages and salaries.

In addition to the payroll taxes, you may have payroll related liabilities for worker compensation insurance, health insurance, 401-k contributions, pensions, vacations, and so on.",what
What accounting entry is made when a company receives an order for its goods or services?,"If money is not received with a customer's order, there will be no accounting entry when the order is received. (However, there could be an entry into the company's computer system for scheduling the work, planning for the materials to be on hand, etc.)
The reasons there is not an entry into the company's general ledger accounts (and no effect on the company's financial statements) when the order is received are 1) the company has not yet earned any revenues, and 2) the company does not yet have a right to a receivable or other asset. The revenues and a receivable are not earned until the company ships or delivers the goods or services. 
The company may have a responsibility to deliver what it offered to the customer, but there is no double-entry business transaction to be recorded at the time that the order is received.",what
What is a certificate of deposit?,"A certificate of deposit, also referred to as a CD, is a time deposit at a bank, credit union, or other financial institution. However, the certificate of deposit cannot be withdrawn until an agreed upon date known as its maturity date. If a withdrawal becomes a necessity, the financial institution will assess a penalty—usually the loss of interest.
A depositor will earn more interest on a certificate of deposit than the amount earned on a savings account or money market account. The length of a certificate of deposit could be one month, three months, six months, one year, 17 months, three years, etc. Generally the longer the time until maturity, the higher the interest rate.
A CD that matures in less than one year will be reported by the bank as a current liability, and will be reported as a short-term investment by the depositor (provided the amount is not restricted by the depositor).",what
How are period costs reported in the financial statements?,"Under the accrual method of accounting, period costs such as selling, general and administrative expenses are reported on the income statement in the accounting period in which they are used up or expire. They are referred to as period costs because they are not assigned to products, and therefore cannot be included in the cost of items held in inventory.
If a selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense is prepaid, the prepaid portion will be reported as a current asset. When the prepaid expense expires, it will move to the income statement and become part of that period's SG&A expenses.
Interest expense is also a period cost unless it is determined to be a necessary cost of a self-constructed, long-lived asset.",what
Which date is used to record a credit card transaction?,"When a business uses its credit card, the transaction date is the date the credit card is used, not the date that the credit card statement is paid.
For example, if a business uses its credit card to purchase an asset on December 30, both the asset and the liability to the credit card company should be recorded as of December 30.
When the business pays the credit card company (perhaps 30 days later), the business will be reducing its cash and its liability to the credit card company.",what
The balance sheet and income statement are connected.,"In the tip of April 20, I mentioned that adjusting entries almost always involve both a balance sheet account and an income statement account. (For example, the cost of supplies that are no longer on hand is moved from the balance sheet to supplies expense on the income statement. Insurance premiums that are no longer prepaid are moved from the balance sheet to insurance expense on the income statement.) The first accounting course teaches us that the basic accounting equation is Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity. Owner's Equity or Stockholders' Equity is a section of the balance sheet that increases when the company's net income increases.
The point of these observations is the following tip: The number of balance sheet accounts is usually small in relation to the number of income statement accounts. If you can be certain that the relatively few balance sheet accounts have the correct ending balances, you can have some confidence that the bottom line of the income statement is proper. (The income statement may contain errors—perhaps you entered an amount into the wrong account—but the overall net income has a good chance of being correct.)
I received this tip from a CPA named Bob many years ago, when he helped me to delegate some accounting work. I continue to value his insight.",what
What is a blank check?,"A blank check often refers to a check that has been signed by an authorized check signer before the other information (date, payee, amount) has been entered on the check. For instance, a small business owner may sign three blank checks before leaving for a seven day vacation. Basically the owner is trusting that the employee holding these checks will enter the information required to make up to three business payments in the owner's absence. This is obviously poor internal control since the employee is able to issue the check for any amount and to any person. In addition these blank checks must be stored in a very secure place since anyone else could also complete the check information.
A blank check could also refer to the completely blank checks that are received from a check printing company. These blank checks do not yet have an authorized signature and are sometimes referred to as check stock. These checks should be stored in a secure place until they are inserted into the company's printer in order to pay its suppliers, etc.
Lastly, blank check sometimes indicates that a large, uncertain amount has been authorized in order to accomplish something. For example, a rich grandparent might indicate that an only grandchild will have a blank check as far as the cost of education.",what
Are the sales taxes part of a retailer's sales?,"No. The sales taxes collected by a retailer are not part of its sales revenues. This means that the sales taxes collected by a retailer will not be reported on its income statement. Rather, the sales taxes collected are reported on the balance sheet as a current liability until they are remitted to the government.
To illustrate, let's assume that all of a retailer's products are subject to a state sales tax of 6%. If the retailer sells $500 of merchandise for cash, it will collect $530. This will be recorded with 1) a debit to Cash for $530, 2) a credit to Sales for $500, and 3) a credit to Sales Taxes Payable for $30. Note that the Sales account did not include the $30 of sales taxes.
When the retailer remits the sales taxes to the government, the liability account Sales Taxes Payable will be debited.",what
Is depreciation a temporary account?,"Depreciation Expense is a temporary account since it is an income statement account. As a temporary account, Depreciation Expense will begin each accounting year with a zero balance and will have its balance at the end of the year closed to an equity account such as retained earnings or a proprietor's capital account.
On the other hand, the balance sheet account Accumulated Depreciation is not a temporary account. Accumulated Depreciation is a contra asset account and its balance is not closed at the end of each accounting period. As a result, Accumulated Depreciation is a viewed as a permanent account.",what
What are the various types of adjusting entries?,"Types of Adjusting Entries
Adjusting entries, which are required in order to have a company's financial statements comply with the accrual method of accounting, are often categorized into three types:

Accruals
Deferrals
Other

Accruals
Accruals or accrual adjusting entries are prepared at the end of an accounting period to report amounts that have occurred in the current accounting period but were not yet entered into the general ledger accounts. An example is a retail store's emergency plumbing repair on December 31, the last day of its accounting period. The repair occurred in the December accounting period but the bill will not be received until the January accounting period. As of December 31, the retailer needs an accrual adjusting entry so that its December financial statements will report the expense and the liability. Also on December 31, the plumbing company will need an accrual adjusting entry so that its financial statements will report the revenues and the receivables that were earned in December.
Deferrals
Deferrals or deferral adjusting entries are prepared at the end of an accounting period to defer expenses and/or revenues that have already been recorded in the general ledger accounts. The reason is that some of the recorded amounts will actually be used up and/or earned in a future accounting period. An example is a retailer's payment of $1,200 for six months of property insurance that was paid in advance. For instance, if the payment was made on December 1 for protection during the upcoming period of December 1 through May 31, the retailer's December's income statement should report Insurance Expense of $200 (the expired 1/6 of the $1,200) and the December 31 balance sheet should report Prepaid Insurance of $1,000 (a current asset that represents the unexpired 5/6 of $1,200). The amount used in the deferral adjusting entry should be whatever is necessary to get the proper amounts to appear on the financial statements. The insurance company must also make a deferral adjusting entry so that its December revenues will include only the $200 that was earned. Its December 31 balance sheet should show the unearned $1,000 as the current liability Deferred Premiums.
Other
Other adjusting entries will likely include:

Depreciation of assets used in a business. This is done with a debit to Depreciation Expense and a credit to Accumulated Depreciation.
Reporting bad debts expense pertaining to accounts receivable. This is done by either debiting Bad Debts Expense and crediting Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, or by writing off an account with a debit to Bad Debts Expense and crediting Accounts Receivable.",what
Is a manufacturer's product warranty part of its manufacturing overhead or is it part of its SG&A expense?,"The costs associated with a manufacturer's product warranty are part of its selling expenses and therefore part of its SG&A expenses.
If the future costs of the warranty coverage are probable and can be estimated, they are recorded at the time of the sale. The accounting entry will debit Warranty Expense and will credit Warranty Liability. If the estimated warranty costs are recorded at  the time of the sale, the actual costs of the repair work or the replacement of the product during the warranty period will be debited to the Warranty Liability account—thereby reducing the liability balance.",what
What adjustment is needed when a check that was written in a previous month appears on the current month's bank statement?,"A check written in any previous month but not appearing on previous bank statements, should have been included in last month's list of outstanding checks. Now that the check appears on the current month's bank statement, the check should not be included in the current month's list of outstanding checks. No other action is needed.
The general ledger account has always been correct, because the amount of the check reduced the general ledger account balance at the time the check was written and recorded.
The problem was the previous bank statements. The bank statement balances were too high since the check had not yet cleared the bank checking account. That's why we subtract the amount of the outstanding checks from the bank statement balance. Now that the bank statement balance has been reduced by the check clearing the bank account, there is no longer a need to further subtract the amount of the check as outstanding.",what
What is a voided check?,"A voided check is a check written or partially written but then canceled or deleted by the maker of the check.
The notation of ""void"" is used because checks are prenumbered for control purposes and every check needs to be accounted for.
Voided checks may require some adjustments when reconciling the bank statement. For example, if a check is written in December but is voided in January, the Cash account in the company's general ledger will need to be increased when the check is voided. (Another account will need to be credited because of double entry bookkeeping.)",what
What is a lump sum payment?,"A lump sum payment is often associated with a single amount paid to acquire a group of items. For instance, a corporation might pay $50,000 for the inventory and equipment of a small manufacturer that is going out of business. The transaction did not specify any further details. The $50,000 is a lump sum payment.
Sometimes the term lump sum payment merely indicates a single payment. For example, the maturity value of a bond might be referred to as a lump sum payment in order to distinguish it from the series of semiannual interest payments.",what
What does drop ship mean?,"One example of drop ship is a manufacturer shipping goods directly to one of its customers' customer (instead of delivering the goods to the customer that placed the order with the manufacturer). The following illustrates the concept of drop ship, drop shipping or a drop shipment.
Assume that XYZ Distributors Inc (XYZ) sells only the Premier brand of water heaters. XYZ receives an order for 40 of the water heaters from a condominium developer located 30 miles away. XYZ then places an order for 40 water heaters from Premier Manufacturing Corp. However, XYZ instructs Premier to deliver them directly to the condo project. So instead of delivering them to XYZ's warehouse, Premier is asked to drop ship them to the condo project. The drop ship means that XYZ will not have to receive the water heaters, unload them, reload them onto its trucks and then deliver them to the condo project. Hence the drop ship allows XYZ to avoid some expensive non-value-added activities.
When Premier ships the water heaters, it will bill XYZ and will send the invoice to XYZ. As a result XYZ will have a purchase and an account payable for the amount charged by Premier. XYZ will prepare its own sales invoice to bill the condo developer.",what
What is a rubber check?,"A rubber check is a check that is not paid (or honored) by the bank on which it is drawn. The reason the check is not paid is the maker's account had insufficient funds or not sufficient funds (NSF). Instead of the check being paid, it will be returned (or bounced back) through the banking system. Because the check was bounced back by the bank, the check is described as a rubber check.
A rubber check also causes bank fees for the maker of the check and for the depositor of the check. These fees need to be recorded in the general ledger accounts. If the fees are overlooked initially, they will be adjusting items to the balance per books in the bank reconciliation.
If a rubber check is not redeposited by the payee, the payee must also reduce its general ledger cash account for the amount of the check (and also debit another general ledger account).",what
Is a postdated check considered to be currency?,"A postdated check—a check with a date that is later than the current date—is not considered to be currency. Further, the postdated check should not be reported as part of the Cash account balance until the date of the check.
If the postdated check was received as payment on accounts receivable, the accounts receivable balance is not reduced until the date of the check.
To illustrate this, let's assume that on August 20 a company receives a $1,000 postdated check. The check is dated September 5 and represents the full payment on one of the company's accounts receivable. Since the postdated check is not considered to be money until the date of the check, the accounts receivable should not be reduced and cash should not be increased until September 5. Therefore, the company's August 31 balance sheet will report that the customer's $1,000 accounts receivable is still due.",what
Is the sales tax on merchandise purchased for resale included in inventory?,"In our state, sales tax is paid only by the end customer. In other words, a retailer does not pay sales tax on merchandise that is purchased for resale. To avoid the sales tax, the retailer furnishes the supplier with a reseller's certificate, which allows the supplier to not charge the sales tax.
If a sales tax is paid by the reseller and the sales tax could have been avoided, the sales tax would have to be expensed immediately. Costs that are not necessary cannot be recorded as assets.
If the sales tax could not have been avoided, then the sales tax would be part of the cost of the merchandise purchased. If the merchandise has not been sold, the entire cost will be reported as inventory, a current asset on the balance sheet. If the merchandise has been sold, then the entire cost will be reported on the income statement as the cost of goods sold.",what
How do you account for the rebate on an automobile?,"The rebate on the purchase of an automobile should be recorded as a reduction of the automobile's cost.
The lower automobile cost will result in lower depreciation expense.",what
How can I learn bookkeeping at a low cost?,"You can use the Internet to learn bookkeeping at a low cost. For example, you can read clear explanations of debits and credits, adjusting entries, financial statements, bank reconciliation, payroll accounting and more at no cost on AccountingCoach.com. You will also find quizzes and Q&A for each topic as well as a huge dictionary. (Visual tutorials, videos, exam questions with answers are also available at a very low cost.)
After you learn the bookkeeping and accounting rules from AccountingCoach.com I recommend that you learn QuickBooks. QuickBooks (from Intuit Inc.) is the leading software for small businesses in the United States. The website Lynda.com offers training videos on QuickBooks and other software (and more) starting at $25 per month. (We do not receive any affiliate revenue from Lynda.com, Intuit, or any other company.)
After you have mastered the material on AccountingCoach and have learned QuickBooks, strive to find a business, bookkeeping service or not-for-profit organization that will provide you with real-world, hands-on experience. Don't be too concerned about the starting pay since your value will come after you demonstrate your proficiency as a skilled bookkeeper.",what
What does the term organic growth mean?,"Organic growth often refers to the growth in a company's sales that did not occur because of an acquisition of another company. Expressed another way, organic growth is the internal growth or the growth from its existing businesses—not from the businesses it acquired during the period.
For example, a company's sales may have increased 25% during the past year. However, all of the sales increase was the result of having acquired a competitor. Therefore, it had no organic growth.",what
What are sales taxes?,"In the United States, most of its 50 States assess a sales tax, which is a tax on sales to the end user. For example, in the state of Wisconsin a retailer must collect a 5% sales tax and perhaps another 0.5% for a county sales tax on specified goods and services. The retailer must remit the sales taxes collected within a prescribed time period.
The items subject to sales tax will vary from state to state. In some states basic food items might not be taxed, but meals at restaurants will be subject to sales tax. Some services might be subject to a sales tax. Sales of raw materials to a manufacturer will be exempt if the materials will be used in products that will be manufactured and sold. When the products are sold by the manufacturer to a retailer for resale, the manufacturer will be also be  exempt from collecting a sales tax. Sales by retailer to an end consumer will require the collection of sales taxes. Sales tax can be viewed as a tax on consumption.
In accounting, the sales taxes collected by the seller of the goods or services are not revenues for the seller. For example, if a merchant sells an item for $100 and the item is subject to a 5% sales tax, the merchant will debit Cash for $105 and will credit Sales for $100 and will credit Sales Tax Payable for $5. Sales Tax Payable is a liability account. When the sales taxes are remitted to the state, the merchant will debit Sales Tax Payable.",what
Is an automobile loan payment an expense?,"Only the interest portion of an automobile loan payment is an expense. The principal portion of the loan payment is a reduction of the loan balance, which is reported as a Note Payable or Loan Payable in the liability section of the balance sheet.
Expressed another way, an automobile loan payment consists of two components: an interest payment and a principal payment. While the loan payment is a cash outflow or an expenditure, only the interest portion is an expense that will be reported on a company's income statement.",what
What does a debit signify in bookkeeping?,"In bookkeeping, a debit can signify an increase in an asset, an expense, and the owner's draws. A debit can also signify a decrease in a liability, revenues, and owner's equity.
A debit is one-half of bookkeeping's double-entry system. The other half is a credit.
A debit is also the amount entered on the left-side of a T-account.",what
What is the difference between a bookkeeper and an accounting clerk?,"I envision a bookkeeper as a person employed by a smaller company and being responsible for recording nearly all of its transactions. Hence, the bookkeeper would likely process sales invoices, customers' remittances, purchases, payments to vendors, payroll, monitoring receivables, preparing journal entries, and more.
I view an accounting clerk as a person employed by a larger company and having a more specialized role. For example, a large company may employ one or more accounts payable clerks to process a large volume of purchases and payments. The company may also employ a payroll clerk to process its many employees' pay and fringe benefits. Perhaps an accounts receivable clerk will be employed to focus solely on the company's credit customers. A manufacturer may employ a cost accounting clerk to prepare price quotes and to monitor production information.",what
How do you record the sales tax on the purchase of an asset?,"Accountants define the cost of an asset as all of the costs that are necessary to obtain the asset and to get it ready for use.
If your state does not allow an exemption from sales tax for the asset you purchased, the sales tax should be recorded as part of the cost of the asset.",what
How does the aging of accounts receivable determine bad debts expense?,"The aging of accounts receivable allows you to quickly identify the credit customers that are past due and the length of time that the amounts have been past due. Focusing on the past due accounts receivable will assist you in estimating how much of the accounts receivable will never be collected.
The estimated amount of accounts receivable that will never be collected should be the credit balance in the general ledger account  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. This credit balance when combined with the debit balance in Accounts Receivable will mean that the amount that is likely to be collected will be reported on the balance sheet.
When the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is credited to increase its balance, the entry will debit the general ledger account Bad Debts Expense.",what
"In bookkeeping, why are revenues credits?","In bookkeeping, revenues are credits because revenues cause owner's equity or stockholders' equity to increase.
Recall that the accounting equation, Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity, must always be in balance. The asset accounts are expected to have debit balances, while the liability and owner's equity accounts are expected to have credit balances. Therefore, when a company earns revenues, it will debit an asset account (such as Accounts Receivable) and will need to credit another account such as Service Revenues. The credit balance in Service Revenues will eventually be moved to the sole proprietor's capital account or to a corporation's Retained Earnings account (thereby increasing the credit balance in one of those owner's or stockholders' equity accounts).",what
What does it mean to check the extensions and to foot an invoice?,"To check the extensions on a purchase invoice means to verify that the number of units of each item multiplied by its unit cost agrees with the total dollar amount for each item. For example, if 15 units of Item Q have a per unit cost of $5, the total cost for Item Q should be $75.
To foot the invoice means to add up the extended costs and verify the total with the amount appearing as the total on the invoice. For example, if the invoice has extended costs of $75 for Item Q and $210 for Item Z, the invoice total should be $285.",what
Are repairs to office equipment an expense?,"Repairing and maintaining office equipment is an immediate expense. This is true even if the repair cost is a very large amount.
If a large expenditure is made to improve office equipment, that cost would be recorded as an asset and then depreciated over the remaining life of the equipment.
Small expenditures to improve office equipment are usually expensed immediately because of the materiality concept. This means the amount is so small that no one will be misled by having the entire amount appear immediately as an expense rather than appearing as depreciation expense over several years. Often improvements of less than $500 or $1,000 are considered immaterial and are expensed immediately.",what
What is a blank endorsement?,"In the case of a check payable to John Smith (the payee), a blank endorsement would be the signature of John Smith on the back side of the check without any other words above or below his signature.
A blank endorsement is considered to be risky because the endorser is not restricting the check (or other negotiable instrument). The blank endorsement indicates that whoever is in possession of the endorsed check is considered to be the owner. To avoid such a risk, businesses and individuals should use restrictive endorsements on the checks they receive.",what
Should an owner's compensation be recorded as an expense or in the Drawing account?,"If the enterprise is a sole proprietorship, the owner's compensation should be debited to the Drawing account.
If the enterprise is a corporation, the owner's gross compensation should be debited to a salary expense account.",what
What is a transposition error?,"Definition of Transposition Error
A transposition error occurs when an amount is recorded incorrectly as the result of switching the positions of two (or more) digits. The switching of the positions causes a difference (between the recorded amount and the correct amount) that will be evenly divisible by 9.
Examples of Transposition Errors
For example, if 986 was the correct amount, but it was recorded incorrectly as 968, the difference between the two amounts is 18. Since this difference is evenly divisible by 9 (18 divided by 9 = exactly 2), the mistake is described as a transposition error. Another example of the many possible transposition errors is recording 3662 as 3626. In this situation, the difference between the correct and incorrect amounts is 36. Because the difference is evenly divisible by 9 (36 divided by 9 = exactly 4), this indicates that the error could be the result of transposing digits.
Determining Whether a Transposition Error Was Involved
If you are faced with finding a difference between two amounts, you might save some time by first dividing the difference by 9. (A few differences that are evenly divisible by 9 include: 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, etc.) Knowing that the error could be a transposition error may lead you to first review the more relevant amounts.",what
Should receipts be recorded using the date the money was received or the date the money was deposited in the bank accounts?,"Cash receipts should be recorded with the date the money was received. For example, a church collects money during each of its services on Sunday, June 4.
On Monday, June 5, the money is counted and is deposited into the church's bank account. The transaction to record the cash and the revenues (remember double entry) should be dated Sunday, June 4, since that is the day of the transaction—the day the church received the money.
The day the money is deposited into the bank account is not the proper date of the transaction. The accounting records should report that the money was received on Sunday, June 4.",what
What if an employee's actual vacation payment is greater than the amount that has been accrued?,"Let's assume that a company's accounting year ends on December 31 and the company has only one employee who worked the full year. The company's handbook specifies that the employee earns 10 hours of vacation for each month worked. However, the vacation hours for the year accumulate. The total vacation hours earned as of December 31 will be paid to the employee on June 1 of the following year by using the employee's June 1 pay rate.
Next, let's assume that each month the company records an accrual adjusting entry that debits Vacation Expense for $200 (10 hours X $20 per hour) and credits Vacation Liability for $200. As a result, the balance in the balance sheet account Vacation Liability at December 31 is $2,400 (12 months X $200, or 120 hours X $20).
On the following June 1, the employee's pay rate is $20.50 which means the employee's gross vacation pay will be $2,460 (120 hours X $20.50). The June 1 journal entry to record the vacation payment is:

Debit Vacation Payable $2,400 (to eliminate the December 31 liability)
Debit Vacation Expense $60
Credit Cash, Payroll Withholdings, etc. for a total of $2,460

Note that the $60 difference was recorded as Vacation Expense in the year of the payment. The financial statements of the prior year were not restated for the $5 monthly differences. The reason is the prior year's monthly amounts were estimates (not mistakes) and the difference is immaterial.",what
How does one prepare a company's first bank statement reconciliation?,"To prepare a bank reconciliation for a company that never prepared one previously, I would first make a list of outstanding checks. For example, if your recent bank statement is dated August 31, I would look at the bank statements from June through August and make a list of the check numbers that had been written after June 1, but had not appeared on any of the bank statements from June through August. Next to each check number write the dollar amount of each check. Subtract the total of the outstanding checks as of August 31 from the bank statement balance as of August 31. The resulting amount is the adjusted balance per bank. 
Next, look at the general ledger account that is associated with the bank statement. Let's assume it is the Cash account. Be certain that the Cash account shows items that appear on the recent bank statements. For example, Have the bank service charges been entered in the Cash account? Have the electronic transfers been entered? If not, you will need to make those entries. You may have to go back to earlier bank statements and enter those amounts as well.
Eventually, you need to get the August 31 balance in the Cash account to be equal to the adjusted balance per bank. If the difference is not a significant amount, you can debit or credit the Cash account for the amount necessary for it to agree to the adjusted balance per bank. I would put the same amount into an income statement account such as Difference per Bank Rec. Keep a copy of your documentation and begin a file entitled Bank Reconciliations.
When the September 30 bank statement arrives, prepare another bank reconciliation. Using a copy of the August 31 listing of outstanding checks, cross off the checks that cleared on the September bank statement. Prepare a September 30 listing of outstanding checks beginning with the checks not crossed off on the August 31 copy, and then add the checks written in September that did not clear on the September bank statement. The total of the outstanding checks as of September 30 should be deducted from the bank statement balance of September 30 to arrive at the adjusted balance per bank as of September 30. Be sure to enter into the Cash account the September bank service charge and other items appearing on the bank statement that have not yet been entered in the Cash account. This adjusted balance in the Cash account as of September 30 should be the same as the adjusted balance per bank as of September 30. If there is a difference, you must identify it and make any necessary adjustments.",what
How do I record exterior cement work? Is it an asset or an expense?,"If the cement work was done to repair or maintain existing cement work, then the expenditure should be recorded as an expense. Even if the cost is very large, repairs and maintenance must be expensed. The cost of repairs or maintenance cannot be recorded as an asset.
If the cement work is an addition or an improvement (more than repairing or maintaining existing cement work), the cost of the cement work is viewed as a new asset. If the amount is significant, you should record the expenditure as an asset and then depreciate the cost over the useful life. However, if the amount of the addition or the improvement is relatively small, the accounting concept of materiality allows you to expense the entire amount immediately.",what
Is it possible to have a balance sheet for a single day?,"A balance sheet presents the amounts of a company's assets, liabilities, and owner's equity as of an instant or moment in time within a day. Usually it is the instant as of the end of the day. In other words, you can have a balance sheet each day, but the balance sheet amounts represent the amount at the instant or moment after all of the transactions of the specified day have been recorded.
We avoid saying that the balance sheet is for the day, since the amounts are not for the 24-hour period. For example, the cash amount that is reported on the balance sheet is the cash as of the end of the day. For the day, the cash balance may have been $1000 at 8 a.m., $1200 at 9 a.m., $823 at 10 a.m., $3134 at 4 p.m., etc. Similarly, account balances such as accounts receivable and accounts payable are changing during the day.
If you do prepare a balance sheet as of the end of each day, you will need to make daily adjusting entries in order for the balance sheet to be meaningful. For example, each day more electricity is used and therefore each day there is an additional liability and an expense for electricity.",what
"If we dispose of an asset, will there be a change in the owner's equity?","The owner's equity of a sole proprietorship will change only if the disposal of an asset causes a gain or loss to be reported on the income statement.
To illustrate this, let's assume that a truck that was used in the business is sold for $5,000. If the truck had a cost of $40,000 and accumulated depreciation of $35,000 there will be no gain or loss reported on the income statement. The reason is the $5,000 received is equal to the $5,000 of book value that is being removed from the balance sheet. With no gain or loss on the disposal, the owner's equity is unchanged.
On the other hand, if the same truck is sold for $3,000 there will be a $2,000 loss ($3,000 of cash received versus the $5,000 of book value removed) reported on the income statement. When the account Loss on Disposal of Assets is closed, the owner's capital account will be reduced by the $2,000 loss.",what
How do you record a check that clears the bank months after it was voided? ,"Since you had voided the check months earlier, your general ledger no longer reflects 1) the original credit to the cash account, and 2) the original debit to another account. Now that the voided check has cleared the bank account, you will need to record the check in your general ledger. The entry will be a credit to the general ledger cash account and a debit (or debits) to the appropriate account.
It might be helpful to recall the bank reconciliation rule: Put it where it isn't. The old check, which you had voided, is now on the bank statement, but it is not in the cash account. Therefore, you need to put the check amount into the general ledger.",what
What is a line of credit?,"In business a line of credit or credit line is an arrangement/commitment by a bank or other creditor with a customer. The agreement specifies an amount that the customer can borrow or use in the future, assuming that the customer's financial condition is maintained.
For example, a company may arrange with its bank to borrow money as needed but never owe the bank in excess of $500,000. The agreement might specify that interest will be calculated by multiplying the prime rate times the loan balance.
In the U.S. many individuals have a home equity line of credit that allows them to borrow up to the amount of ""the line.""",what
What is the net method?,"In accounting and bookkeeping, the net method often refers to how a company records each vendor invoice. Under the net method, the company will credit Accounts Payable for the invoice amount minus any early payment discount that is offered. For example, if a vendor's invoice for $1,000 has credit terms of 2/10, net 30 days, the company will record the invoice at the net amount of $980 ($1,000 minus 2% of $1,000). In this example, Accounts Payable will be credited for $980 and another account (Inventory, Purchases, etc.) will be debited for $980. 
If the company's policy is to pay all vendor invoices within the discount period, the net method will result in a more precise current liability on its balance sheet. It will also mean that the accounts and amounts recorded as debits will better reflect the historical cost principle.
If the company fails to remit the net amount within the discount period, the net method requires a debit entry to the expense Purchase Discounts Lost. In our example, if the company pays the invoice in 30 days, it is not entitled to the early payment discount and will therefore have to credit Cash for $1,000. The debit amounts will be Accounts Payable for $980 and Purchase Discounts Lost for $20. Any amount recorded in Purchase Discounts Lost informs management that its policy of paying within the discount period has been violated.
Although the net method is theoretically better, it seems to be less efficient than recording vendor invoices at their stated amounts.",what
Are undeposited checks reported as cash?,"Undeposited checks that are not postdated (not dated with a future date) are reported as cash. Accountants define cash as more than just currency and coins. For example, unrestricted checking accounts are also reported as cash.",what
Is the sales tax paid on merchandise that you will resell an expense?,"I believe that most states have sales tax exemptions for merchandise purchased for resale. Check with your state's sales tax department to see if you can obtain a resellers permit to avoid being charged the sales tax by your suppliers.
If you purchase an asset and the sales tax is required, the sales tax should be recorded as part of the cost of the goods or services received. For example, if you were required to pay sales tax on the new company car, the cost of the car will include the sales tax. If you purchased supplies and the cost of the supplies was subject to sales tax, the sales tax is part of the cost of the supplies. If you received services that were subject to the sales tax, the sales tax is a necessary part of the cost of the services.",what
What is the maximum amount of earnings subject to the Social Security tax in 2019 and 2020?,"2019 Annual Earnings Limit for Social Security Payroll Tax
The maximum amount of an employee's 2019 earnings (and a self-employed person's net income) that is subject to the Social Security payroll tax is $132,900. This amount is also known as the Social Security annual limit, wage base, contribution and benefit base, ceiling, tax cap, and maximum taxable earnings. The maximum amount is adjusted annually based on the national average wage index. 
2020 Annual Earnings Limit for Social Security Payroll Tax
For the calendar year 2020 (January 1 through December 31, 2020) the maximum amount of an employee's earnings that is subject to the Social Security payroll tax is $137,700.
An Employer Must Match Its Employees' Social Security Payroll Taxes
The earnings limits are used to compute the employee's maximum Social Security tax and therefore the employer's maximum Social Security payroll tax for each employee. (The employer is required to match each employee's withholdings of the Social Security tax and must remit both the employees' withholdings and the employer's matching amount to the U.S. government.)
Social Security Payroll Tax is One Part of the FICA Payroll Tax
The combination of the Social Security payroll tax and the Medicare payroll tax is referred to as the FICA tax. However, there is no annual limit or cap on the earnings when computing the Medicare tax for the employee, the self-employed person, or the employer.",what
"Why can a retailer record its purchase of merchandise as a debit to purchases within the cost of goods sold, instead of the asset inventory?","Before we explain why companies will record the purchases of merchandise in the Purchases account instead of the Inventory account, let's agree that the objective of the accounting process is to have accurate financial statements. In this case we want an income statement which reports an accurate amount of cost of goods sold, and the resulting gross profit and net income. We need the balance sheet to report an accurate cost of inventory, and the resulting amount of current assets, working capital, total assets, and stockholders' equity. I believe this objective will require some type of an adjustment to the the Inventory account balance and to the cost of goods sold regardless of how the purchases of merchandise were initially recorded.
Now for the reason companies often record purchases in a purchases account. Generally, companies will have a relatively stable amount of inventory and the cost of its annual purchases will be many times the cost of its inventory. This means that most of the cost of its purchases will appear as the cost of goods sold on its income statement. For the minor change in the cost of inventory from the beginning to the end of the accounting period, an adjustment can be made. For example, let's assume that the cost of purchases during the year amounted to $560,000. Let's also assume that the inventory at the end of the year has a cost of $70,000 compared to the inventory cost of $67,000 at the end of the previous accounting year. An adjustment will be entered to debit the Inventory account for $3,000 which will increase the Inventory account balance from $67,000 to $70,000. The credit portion of the entry of $3,000 will cause the cost of goods sold to be reported as $557,000 ($560,000 of debits in the Purchases account during the year minus the amount that increased the cost of inventory: $3,000). After this adjustment, the balance sheet will report the true cost of the ending inventory of $70,000 and the income statement will report the true cost of goods sold of $557,000.",what
What is columnar?,"Prior to electronic worksheets, accountants had several pads of paper with a varying number of columns (and rows) preprinted on them. The pads of paper were labeled as columnar pads. The preprinted paper in these pads allowed accountants and bookkeepers to easily prepare manual spreadsheets.
With the introduction of VisiCalc (the original electronic spreadsheet) followed by other electronic spreadsheets or worksheets (e.g., Lotus 1-2-3, Excel), the use of columnar pads of paper declined significantly.",what
"If a customer pays for the same invoice twice, should the customer be informed?","I say yes. If you become aware of the double payment when posting the customer's second remittance, I would double check your records to be certain you are not owed money from the customer and would then inform the customer.  If the check was sent in error, I would photocopy the check, document on the photocopy what had occurred, and then return it to the customer.
If you did not notice the double payment when processing the customer's remittance, the customer's accounts receivable record will show a negative amount due for the sales invoice and might even show a negative amount due from the customer. If your company mails statements to its customers, the customer should be able to see its double payment when reviewing the statement.",what
What is the entry for an employee's personal phone calls included in the company's bill?,"Let's assume that an employee has made personal phone calls of $20 which are included in the company's phone bill of $100. Below are two options for recording the cost of the employee's personal phone calls.
If the employee is paying (reimbursing) the company immediately, you can record the entire phone bill with a debit of $100 to the company's account Telephone Expense. You will also credit Telephone Expense for $20 when you record the $20 receipt from the employee.
If the employee is not paying the company immediately, you can record the $100 phone bill by debiting Telephone Expense for $80 and debiting the asset account Receivable from Employees for $20. When you receive the $20 from the employee, you will credit the account Receivable from Employees.",what
Why is a product that sells for $50 reported in inventory at its cost of $40?,"Generally, items in inventory are valued at their cost—not their selling prices—because of the cost principle.
Another reason for not valuing items in inventory at their selling prices is that inventory items cannot be sold without a sales effort. Until that effort is made and an item is actually sold, the company cannot report the $10 increase from $40 to $50. This is referred to as the revenue recognition principle. In other words, only after an item is actually sold can the company report the revenue of $50 minus the cost of $40 for a gross profit of $10.
There are some exceptions to reporting inventory at cost. One exception is industries where no sales effort is required and the extensive effort of production has been completed. In these industries the inventory may be reported at its net realizable value, which is the sales value minus the costs to dispose of the items. The gold mining industry and certain other commodities are examples.
Another exception to reporting inventory at cost occurs in any industry when a product will have to be sold for less than its cost. In that situation the item should normally be reported at its net realizable value. (U.S. income tax rules require conformity between tax and financial reporting. As a result, there are complexities involved.)",what
Kindly illustrate various depreciation methods.,"I will illustrate the following methods of depreciation: straight-line, units of production, double-declining balance, and sum of the years' digits. These methods can be used for financial reporting. (The depreciation methods for income tax purposes are not illustrated.)
Let's assume that a plant asset has a cost of $100,000 with an estimated salvage value of $10,000. This makes the depreciable cost $90,000. The asset has a useful life of 5 years or the production of 100,000 parts. The asset is placed into service on January 1, 2012 and the company's accounting year is January 1 through December 31.
Straight-line: Depreciable cost of $90,000 divided by 5 years = $18,000 of depreciation each year for 5 years. Download our Straight-line Form and Template.
Units of production: Depreciable cost of $90,000 divided by 100,000 parts = $0.90 per part. In 2012 the company produces 12,000 parts X $0.90 = $10,800 of depreciation. In 2013 the company produces 30,000 parts X $0.90 = $27,000 of depreciation. Continue until accumulated depreciation reaches $90,000. Download our Units of Activity (Production) Form and Template.
Double-declining balance: Straight-line depreciation rate is 20% (100% divided by 5 years). Double the straight-line rate is 40% (20% X 2). This rate is applied to the book value of the asset at the beginning of each year. (Book value is cost minus accumulated depreciation.) For the year 2012 the double-declining balance depreciation is: beginning book value of $100,000 X 40% = $40,000. In 2013 the calculation is: beginning book value of $60,000 X 40% = $24,000. Continue until the accumulated depreciation reaches $90,000. Download our Double Declining Balance Form and Template.
Sum of the years' digits: Add the digits in the years of useful life: 5+4+3+2+1 = 15. In the first year (2012) multiply 5/15 times the depreciable cost of $90,000 = $30,000 of depreciation. In 2013 multiply 4/15 times $90,000 = $24,000. In 2014 multiply 3/15 times $90,000, and so on.",what
Our income statement shows wide fluctuations in utilities expense from month to month. I suspect our accounting is not proper. Any suggestions?,"Under accrual accounting, your income statement should report the amount for the utilities used during the period of the income statement. The utility bills tell you the cost of the gas and electricity used between the meter reading dates appearing on the utility bill. For example, if the meters are read on the last day of the month then the utility bills received in early July will tell you the cost of the utilities used during the month of June. It is this cost that your company should report as expense on its June income statement. The amount of the utility bills with meter reading dates of June 30 should be reported as a current liability (accounts payable) as of June 30.
When the utility bills are based on monthly meter readings other than on the last day of the month, it gets a bit more complicated. For example, if the meters are read on the 20th day of each month, then the utility bill received at the end of June will show the cost of the utilities used between May 21 and June 20. The amount of this bill is also the liability amount as of June 20th. Since the balance sheet is dated June 30th (and the income statement is for the entire month of June), an adjusting entry should be made to record the additional liability for the utilities used from June 20 through June 30.
To have the correct amount on the income statement, you need to report the expense for the 30 or 31 days during the calendar month that the utilities were used. To have the correct liability amount reported on the balance sheet, you need to report the cost of the utilities used through the last day of the month that have not yet been paid. The reason for this complexity is that the utility provides the electricity and gas each day, but it reads the meters only on one day per month. As a result you will always owe the utility some amount, even if you have paid the most recent utility bill. In short you will need to make an adjusting entry to get the financial statements accurate under accrual accounting.
You raised an important point. You should discuss this further with your accountant.",what
What is the difference between information and data?,"I was taught that information is useful data. The point is there are lots of data (plural of datum) everywhere, and most of the data will not be useful to a decision maker. Only after the data have been sorted and the relevant portions presented to a decision maker will the data become information.
While that is the distinction that I learned many years ago, I believe that most people use the terms information and data interchangeably. In other words, one person might say data processing and another might say information processing, and both could be referring to the same thing.",what
Is a money market account a current asset or a fixed asset?,A money market account is a current asset unless it is restricted for a long-term purpose. The amount of an unrestricted money market account will likely be reported on the balance sheet as part of a company's cash or its cash and cash equivalents.,what
Should a retailer's delivery surcharges be reported as revenues or as other income?,"I believe that a retailer's delivery surcharges are a price adjustment and should be reported as operating revenues. The surcharges are operating revenues that will be matched with the higher operating expenses such as gasoline. The delivery surcharges should not be reported as nonoperating revenues or other income. Nonoperating revenues or other income items would be outside the main activities of the retailer and would include items such as interest earned or the gain on the sale of a plant asset.
The retailer can record the delivery surcharges in a separate operating revenue account. In other words the sales revenues account could be used to record the revenues excluding the surcharges and then another sales revenue account could be designated as the delivery surcharge revenues account. Those two accounts would then be added together to report total operating revenues.",what

Why is it necessary to allocate a lump sum payment to individual items?,"It is necessary to allocate a lump sum payment to individual items in order to record a fair portion of the lump sum in each of the proper general ledger accounts.
For instance, let's assume that a corporation made a lump sum payment of $450,000 in order to acquire a building, the land on which the building sits, and also some equipment. The lump sum payment means that the total cost of $450,000 has to be allocated among three general ledger accounts: Land, Buildings, and Equipment. The allocation must be done in a logical manner for the following reasons:

the portion of the lump sum cost that is recorded in the Land account will not be depreciated
the portion of the lump sum cost that is recorded in the Buildings account might be depreciated over a 25-year period, and
the portion of the lump sum cost that is recorded in the Equipment account might be depreciated over 7 years.",what
What does it mean to recognize an expense?,"Definition of Recognize an Expense
To recognize an expense means to report the proper amount of an expense on the income statement for the appropriate accounting period.
When and How to Recognize an Expense

When there is a cause-and-effect relationship between a company's revenues and some of its expenses, these expenses should appear on the same income statement as the associated revenues. Accountants describe this as matching expenses with revenues. For instance, a company's sales of products which are properly reported on its July income statement will cause the related expense known as the cost of goods sold to be reported/recognized on the July income statement. If the company's sales reps have earned commissions on the July sales, these commissions should also be recognized/reported as Commissions Expense on the company's July income statement (regardless of when the company pays the commissions).
If a cause-and-effect relationship does not exist between a company's revenues and its costs, and there is no future economic benefit which can be measured, the costs should be recognized/reported immediately as expenses on the current income statement. A few examples include advertising, office salaries, interest on most loans, and research and development costs.
When a cost has a future economic benefit which can be measured, the accountant should report the cost as an asset. Then as the future benefit expires (is used up) the cost should be systematically recognized/reported as an expense on the appropriate income statements. Some examples include the expensing of prepaid insurance premiums and the depreciation of assets used in the company's business.

Use of Adjusting Entries
Companies use adjusting entries in order for their income statements and balance sheets to be reporting the proper amounts in the appropriate accounting periods under the accrual method of accounting.",what
Are estimates allowed in bookkeeping?,"While bookkeeping involves mostly precise amounts from sales and purchase invoices, cash receipts and checks written, etc. there are situations when estimates need to be entered. This is especially true when monthly financial statements are prepared under the accrual method of accounting. For instance, the monthly bookkeeping entries for depreciation, property taxes, utilities, fringe benefits and more will need to be estimates.
Even the end-of-year financial statements will require some estimated amounts. For example, a company's liability for warranties on its products and its allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable will need to be estimates. Providing an estimated amount is better than ignoring reality and reporting a zero amount.
I recommend that the company's accountant review the estimated amounts that will be entered in the bookkeeping or accounting system.",what
What type of expense is the purchase of propane?,"Technically, the purchase of propane is not an expense. Depending on the business, the propane is an asset until it is used, resold, or included in a product that is sold. At that time it will become an expense.
If the purchased propane is used relatively soon, accountants will usually skip recording the asset. Here are three examples of how the expense might be reported on the company's income statement.
Example 1. A service company purchases $900 of propane to heat its office for the following month. Technically the propane is an asset until used. However, the accountant is likely to skip recording of the asset and will record the purchase as a $900 operating expense.
Example 2. A local dealer purchases large quantities of propane and then delivers the propane in small quantities to its customers. The dealer will record the purchase as the asset Propane Inventory. As the propane is sold, the dealer will reduce Propane Inventory for the cost of the propane sold and will increase the expense Cost of Goods Sold.
Example 3. A manufacturer uses propane in its factory operations. The cost of the propane purchased is likely to be recorded as Manufacturing Overhead. Manufacturing Overhead is allocated to the products manufactured and will be part of the products' cost. If the products are in Inventory, those products' costs are assets. If the products are sold, those products' costs will be expensed as Cost of Goods Sold.",what
What is the proper use of the words lend and borrow?,"If a company is granted a loan from its bank, the company is borrowing money from its bank, and the bank is lending money to one of its customers. In other words, the bank is the lender and the loan customer is the borrower.

What is a sale on credit?,"Definition of Sale on Credit
A sale on credit is revenue earned by a company when it sells goods and allows the buyer to pay at a later date. This is also referred to as a sale on account.
Normally, this means that the company selling the goods is transferring ownership of its goods to the buyer and in return has a current asset known as accounts receivable. One consequence is the seller becomes one of the buyer's unsecured creditors. This means that the seller has the risk of bad debts expense if the buyer does not pay the full amount owed to the seller.
Example of a Sale on Credit
Assume that a company is in an industry where it is necessary to give customers invoice payment terms of net 30 days. If the company sells $10,000 of goods to a customer with those terms, the company will debit Accounts Receivable for $10,0000 and will credit Sales for $10,000. When the company receives the $10,000 from the customer, the company will debit Cash for $10,000 and will credit Accounts Receivable for $10,000.",what
What is the IRS mileage rate for use of a car in business in 2018 and 2019?,"IRS Mileage Rate for 2018
The optional standard rate allowed by the Internal Revenue Service for the business use of a car in the calendar year 2018 (January 1 through December 31, 2018) is 54.5 cents per mile.
IRS Mileage Rate for 2019
The optional standard rate allowed by the Internal Revenue Service for the business use of a car in the calendar year 2019 (January 1 through December 31, 2019) is 58 cents per mile.
Further Information
In addition to the above optional standard rates per mile, you are also allowed to claim an expense for parking fees and tolls that are associated with the business use of your car.
The optional standard rate has some restrictions such as the number of vehicles used at one time and the prior use of certain depreciation.
An alternative to the optional standard rate per mile is to compute the business portion of the actual expenses for gasoline, repairs, insurance, depreciation, licenses, etc.

Reducing the Need for Accruing Expenses,"One day I was explaining to the owner of a small business that I would have to accrue for the shipping expenses associated with his company's sales. Since the shipping company billed him on the 15th of each month for his shipments from the 16th of the previous month until the 15th of the current month, we needed to estimate the expense for the second half of the month. For example, when I was preparing his company's November 30th balance sheet and its November income statement, we didn't have the shipping expense for November 16 – 30. (He also let me know that during this 15-day period, the shipping expense would be higher than any other 15-day period due to holiday sales.)
He listened carefully as I explained the matching principle, accrual-type adjusting entries, and reversing entries. As soon as I had finished, he phoned the shipping company and asked that his billing period be changed to cover the calendar month. They were pleased to make the change.
Next, the owner called his bank and asked if the bank would be able to deduct the current month's loan interest from the company's checking account on the last day of each month. The bank was pleased to arrange for this procedure.
In less than 15 minutes, the owner eliminated the need for me to calculate/estimate the amounts for two adjusting entries every month. Soon, each month's actual amounts would be arriving automatically.",what
What is net sales?,"Definition of Net Sales
Under the accrual basis of accounting, net sales is the total amount of goods shipped/delivered to customers during a specified period of time minus any early payment discounts (if offered by the seller) and minus allowances for goods returned by customers, adjustments to the sales invoice amounts, etc. 
Does Sales Include Sales Tax?
The amount of a company's sales does not include the sales taxes collected by the seller. The reason is that the sales taxes included in the sales invoices are not revenues earned by the seller. Instead, the sales taxes are the state/local government's revenues. The seller is merely acting as an agent that is required to collect and remit the sales taxes to the government.
As a result, the sales taxes included in a company's sales invoices are recorded in a current liability account such as Sales Taxes Payable. When the company remits the sales taxes to the state or local government, the balance in Sales Taxes Payable is reduced. Any unremitted balance in Sales Taxes Payble is reported in the current liability section of the company's balance sheet.
Sales vs Net Sales
Assume that a company has sales invoices for the month amounting to $63,000. The sales invoices represent the goods shipped to customers and includes $1,000 of sales taxes pertaining to its retail customers. The company offers credit terms of 1/10, net 30 days and some customers paid within 10 days and were granted early payment discounts of $300. The company also granted allowances of $200 to customers who received damaged goods or had been given a price adjustment.
Given the above information, the company's sales are calculated as follows:
Sales invoices with a total of $63,000 minus $1,000 of sales taxes that were included as required by the state/local government = the company's sales of $62,000. Sales are also referred to as gross sales.
The company's net sales are calculated as follows:
Sales (or gross sales) of $62,000 minus early payment discounts of $300 and sales allowances of $200 = the company's net sales of $61,500.",what

How do you calculate the break-even point in terms of sales?,"Definition of Break-even Point in Sales Dollars
The break-even point in sales dollars can be calculated by dividing a company's total fixed expenses by the company's contribution margin ratio.
Definition of Contribution Margin Ratio
A company's total contribution margin in dollars is the total net sales minus the total amount of variable expenses. Dividing the contribution margin in dollars by the total amount of net sales is the contribution margin ratio. 
Example of Break-even Point in Sales Dollars
To illustrate the break-even point in sales dollars, let's assume that a company has fixed expenses of $100,000 per year. The variable expenses are estimated to be 80% of the net sales. This means that the contribution margin ratio is 20% of net sales.
Since only 20% of the sales dollars are available to cover the $100,000 fixed expenses, the company will need to have $500,000 of net sales ($100,000 divided by 20%). At $500,000 of net sales, the amount of variable expenses will be $400,000 (80% X $500,000). That leaves $100,000 to cover the $100,000 of fixed expenses. Hence, at $500,000 of net sales the company will be at the break-even point, which is the point where sales will be equal to all of the company's expenses. This is the point where the net income will be zero.",what
What is cost accounting?,"Definition of Cost Accounting
Cost accounting is involved with the following:

Determining the costs of products, processes, projects, etc. in order to report the correct amounts on a company's financial statements, and
Assisting management in the planning and control of the organization
Preparing special analyses that assists in making the best decisions

Examples of Cost Accounting
A significant part of cost accounting involves the unit cost of a manufacturer's products in order to report the cost of inventory on its balance sheet and the cost of goods sold on its income statement. This is achieved with techniques such as the allocation of manufacturing overhead costs and through the use of process costing, operations costing, and job-order costing systems.
Cost accounting assists management to plan and control the business through budgeting for operations, capital budgeting for expanding operations, standard costing and the reporting of variances, transfer pricing, etc.
Special analyses includes cost behavior, cost-volume-profit relationships, make or buy decisions, selling prices for products, activity-based costing, and more.
Cost accounting had its roots in manufacturing businesses. However, today it extends to service businesses. For example, a bank will use cost accounting to determine the cost of processing a customer's check and/or a deposit, maintaining a checking account, processing international wire transfers, servicing a mortgage loan, etc. This in turn may provide management with guidance in the pricing of various services.",what
What is the break-even point?,"Definition of Break-even Point
In accounting, the break-even point refers to the revenues necessary to cover a company's total amount of fixed and variable expenses during a specified period of time. The revenues could be stated in dollars (or other currencies), in units, hours of services provided, etc.
The basic calculation of the break-even point in sales dollars for a year is: fixed expenses (fixed manufacturing, fixed SG&A, fixed interest) for the year divided by the contribution margin ratio or percentage.
The basic calculation of the break-even point in units sold for a year is: fixed expenses for the year divided by the contribution margin per unit of product.
Examples of Break-even Point
To illustrate the break-even point, let's assume that a company's fixed expenses are $480,000 for a year, its variable expenses (variable manufacturing, variable SG&A, variable interest) average $8 per unit of product, and its selling prices average $20 per unit. The result is an average contribution margin of $12 per unit and an average contribution margin ratio of 60% ($12 divided by the average selling price of $20). Using this information, the company will have:

A break-even point in sales dollars  of $800,000 [$480,000 divided by 60%]
A break-even point in units of product of 40,000 [$480,000 divided by $12 per unit]

The break-even calculations are based on the assumption that the change in a company's variable costs are related to the change in revenues. This assumption may not hold true for a variety of reasons including changes in the mix of products sold and varying contribution margins of the products.",what
What is the difference between gross margin and contribution margin?,"Definition of Gross Margin
Some use the term gross margin to mean the same as gross profit, which is: net sales minus the cost of goods sold. Others use the term gross margin to indicate the gross profit as a percentage of net sales.
The cost of goods sold will consist of both fixed and variable product costs. However, selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) are not part of the cost of goods sold. 
Definition of Contribution Margin
Contribution margin is defined as net sales minus both the variable product costs and the variable SG&A expenses. The contribution margin can also be expressed as a percentage of net sales. In that case it is often described as the contribution margin ratio.
Information for Examples
Let's assume that a company had the following amounts during the past year:

Net sales of $600,000
Cost of goods sold of $320,000 ($120,000 variable + $200,000 of fixed)
Inventories did not increase or decrease
SG&A expenses of $190,000 ($40,000 variable + $150,000 fixed)

Example of Gross Margin
The company's gross margin is: net sales of $600,000 minus the cost of goods sold of $320,000 = $280,000. The gross margin or gross profit percentage is: gross profit of $280,000 divided by net sales of $600,000 = 46.7%.
Example of Contribution Margin
The company's contribution margin is: net sales of $600,000 minus the variable product costs of $120,000 and the variable expenses of $40,000 = $440,000. The contribution margin ratio is 73.3% ($440,000 divided by $600,000).",what
What is contribution margin?,"Definition of Contribution Margin
In accounting, contribution margin is defined as: revenues minus variable expenses. The contribution margin can be expressed as an amount and/or as a ratio or percent of revenues.
The contribution margin tells us how much of the revenues will be available (after the variable expenses are covered) for the fixed expenses and net income.
The contribution margin amount or ratio (ratio) can be presented for:

The company as a whole
A product line
An individual unit of a product

Example of Contribution Margin
Let's assume that a manufacturer has only one product and 80,000 units were manufactured and sold during a recent year. The selling price was $10 per unit. The variable expenses were $4 per unit (consisting of manufacturing costs of $3 per unit and variable SG&A expenses of $1 per unit). The company's fixed expenses were $390,000 (consisting of fixed manufacturing costs of $300,000 and fixed SG&A expenses of $90,000).
The amount of the company's contribution margin was $480,000 calculated using the following amounts:

Revenues of $800,000 (80,000 units X $10 per unit)
Variable expenses of $320,000 (80,000 X $4 per unit)

The contribution margin ratio for the company was 60% (contribution margin of $480,000 divided by revenues of $800,000).
The contribution per unit of the company's only product was $6 consisting of revenues of $10 minus the variable expenses of $4. The contribution margin ratio for the product was also 60% (contribution margin of $6 divided by the selling price of $10).
The contribution margin is a key component in computing a company's break-even point.",what
What is the margin of safety?,"Definition of Margin of Safety
In break-even analysis, the term margin of safety indicates the amount of sales that are above the break-even point. In other words, the margin of safety indicates the amount by which a company's sales could decrease before the company will have no profit.
Example of Margin of Safety
Let's assume that a company currently sells 3,000 units of its only product. The company has estimated that its break-even point is 2,800 units. Therefore, the company's margin of safety is 200 units.",what
What is cost behavior?,"Definition of Cost Behavior
Cost behavior is an indicator of how a cost will change in total when there is a change in some activity. In cost accounting and managerial accounting, three types of cost behavior are usually discussed:

Variable costs. The total amount of a variable cost increases in proportion to the increase in an activity. The total amount of a variable cost will also decrease in proportion to the decrease in an activity.
Fixed costs. The total amount of a fixed cost will not change when an activity increases or decreases.
Mixed or semivariable costs. These costs are partially fixed and partially variable.

Understanding how costs behave is important for management's planning and controlling of its organization's costs, and for cost-volume-profit analyses (including the calculation of a company's break-even point).
Examples of Cost Behavior
An example of a variable cost is the cost of flour for a bakery that produces artisan breads. The greater the number of loaves produced, the greater the total cost of the flour used by the bakery.
An example of a fixed cost is the depreciation and insurance on the bakery facility and equipment. Regardless of the quantity of artisan breads produced in a month, the total amount of depreciation and insurance cost for the month will remain the same.
An example of a mixed cost or semivariable cost is the bakery's cost of natural gas. Some of the monthly gas bill is a flat fee charged by the utility and some of the gas bill is the cost of heating the building. These two components of the gas bill are fixed since they will not change when the bakery produces more or less loaves of its bread. However, a third component of the gas bill is the cost of operating the ovens. This component is a variable cost since it will increase when the ovens must operate for a longer time in order to produce additional loaves of bread.",what
What are mixed costs?,"Definition of Mixed Costs
In accounting, the term mixed costs refers to costs and expenses that consist of two components:

A fixed component, the total of which does not change as the volume of activity changes
A variable component, the total of which changes in proportion to the change in the volume of activity

A mixed cost is also referred to as a semivariable cost.
A mixed cost is expressed by the algebraic formula y = a + bx, where:

y is the total cost
a is the fixed cost per period
b is the variable rate per unit of activity
x is the number of units of activity

To visualize the behavior of a mixed cost, it is helpful to graph at least 8 observations. Each observation's total cost (y) is aligned with the y-axis and is also aligned with the volume amounts indicated on the x-axis. To compute the best fitting line through the graphed data, you could use a mathematical tool known as simple linear regression analysis. This will calculate the fixed expenses (a) and the variable rate (b) based on the historical observations.
Example of Mixed Costs
The annual expense of operating an automobile is a mixed cost. Some of the expenses are fixed because they do not change in total as the number of annual miles change. These include insurance, parking fees, and some depreciation. Some of the expenses are variable since the total amount will increase when more miles are driven and will decrease when fewer miles are driven. The variable expenses include gas, oil, tires, and some depreciation.
Let's assume that a simple linear regression analysis indicates that the past annual expense of operating an automobile (y) consisted of the fixed cost (a) of $5,000 per year and the variable rate (b) was $0.20. When the number of miles driven during a year (x) are 15,000 miles, the expected total annual expense is the fixed expense $5,000 + the variable expense of $0.20 X 15,000 = $5,000 + $3,000 = $8,000. If the miles driven are 10,000 miles, the expected total annual expense is the fixed expense of $5,000 + the variable expense of $0.20 X 10,000 = $5,000 + $2,000 = $7,000.",what
Are direct costs fixed and indirect costs variable?,"Direct Costs vs. Indirect Costs
The terms direct costs and indirect costs could be referring to a product, a department, a machine, geographic market, etc. (which are referred to as cost objects). 
If the cost object is a company's product that is being manufactured, the cost of the product's raw materials and the cost of the employees on the assembly line are direct costs since they are directly traceable to the product. However, the cost of the other employees in the manufacturing facility (maintenance, clean-up, material handlers, etc.) and the other costs of the manufacturing facility (depreciation, property tax, maintenance, heat, and insurance) are indirect product costs since these costs must be allocated to the product. These indirect product costs are also known as manufacturing overhead costs, factory overhead costs, and burden.
If the cost object is the company's production department, the depreciation of the production equipment and the salary of the manager of the production department are direct costs of the production department. However, the depreciation, heat, and maintenance, etc. of the building containing the production department (which also includes the warehouse for materials, the warehouse for finished goods, the shipping department, and quality control department) are indirect costs of the production department, since they must be allocated to the production department.
Fixed Costs vs. Variable Costs
If the cost object is a product being manufactured, it is likely that direct materials are a variable cost. (If one pound of material is used for each unit, then this direct cost is variable.) However, the product's indirect manufacturing costs are likely a combination of fixed costs and variable costs. For instance, if the managers within the manufacturing facility but not on the assembly line are paid salaries which total $20,000 per month, this cost is a fixed indirect product cost. The equipment maintenance expense and the temporary shipping clerks could be a variable indirect product cost, since this cost will vary with production volume.
If the cost object is the production department, the direct and indirect department costs are likely to be partly fixed and partly variable. For example, the production department has it own electric meter to measure the electricity used to operate its equipment. Therefore, the electricity cost is a direct production department cost that is variable since it changes with the volume of products manufactured. On the other hand the salaries of the production department supervisors are a direct production department cost that is fixed.",what
What is the high-low method?,"The high-low method is a simple technique for computing the variable cost rate and the total amount of fixed costs that are part of mixed costs. Mixed costs are costs that are partially variable and partially fixed. The cost of electricity used in a factory is likely to be a mixed cost since some of the electricity will vary with the number of machine hours, while some of the cost will not vary with machine hours. Perhaps this second part of the electricity cost is associated with circulating and chilling the air in the factory and from the public utility billing its large customers with a significant fixed monthly charge not directly tied to the kilowatt hours of electricity used.
The high-low method uses two sets of numbers: 1) the total dollars of the mixed costs occurring at the highest volume of activity, and 2) the total dollars of the mixed costs occurring at the lowest volume of activity. It is assumed that at both points of activity the total amount of fixed costs is the same. Therefore, the change in the total costs is assumed to be the variable cost rate times the change in the number of units of activity. Prior to using the high-low method, it is important to plot or graph all of the data available to be certain that the two sets of numbers being used are indeed representative.
To illustrate the high-low method, let's assume that a company had total costs of electricity of $18,000 in the month when its highest activity was 120,000 machine hours. (Be sure to match the dates of the machine hours to the electric meter reading dates.) During the month of its lowest activity there were 100,000 machine hours and the total cost of electricity was $16,000. This means that the total monthly cost of electricity changed by $2,000 when the number of machine hours changed by 20,000. This indicates that the variable cost rate was $0.10 per machine hour.
Continuing with this example, if the total electricity cost was $18,000 when there were 120,000 machine hours, the variable portion is assumed to have been $12,000 (120,000 machine hours times $0.10). Since the total electricity cost was $18,000 and the variable cost was calculated to be $12,000, the fixed cost of electricity for the month must have been the $6,000. If we use the lowest level of activity, the total cost of $16,000 would include $10,000 of variable cost (100,000 machine hours times $0.10) with the remainder of $6,000 being the fixed cost for the month.",what
What is the contribution margin ratio?,"Definition of Contribution Margin Ratio
The contribution margin ratio is the percentage of sales revenues, service revenues, or selling price remaining after subtracting all of the variable costs and variable expenses. 
Expressed another way, the contribution margin ratio is the percentage of revenues that is available to cover a company's fixed costs, fixed expenses, and profit.
Note that the contribution margin ratio is not the same as the gross margin ratio or gross profit percentage. Further, the contribution margin ratio cannot be computed from the amounts appearing on a company's external income statement.
Example of Contribution Margin Ratio
Assume that a company manufactures and sells a single product and has the following information:

Selling price per unit is $20
Fixed manufacturing costs per month is $18,000
Variable manufacturing costs per unit is $4
Fixed SG&A expenses per month is $12,000
Variable SG&A expenses per unit is $2
Fixed interest expense per month is $1,000

Using the above information the contribution margin per unit is $14 (the selling price of $20 minus the variable manufacturing costs of $4 and variable SG&A expenses of $2). Therefore, the contribution margin ratio is 70% (the contribution margin per unit of $14 divided by the selling price of $20). This contribution margin ratio tells us that 70% of the sales revenues (or 70% of the selling price) is available to cover the company's $31,000 of monthly fixed costs and fixed expenses ($18,000 + $12,000 + $1,000). Once the $31,000 has been covered, 70% of the revenues will flow to the company's net income.",what
What causes an increase in break-even point?,"Definition of Break-even Point
The break-even point is the sales volume or sales revenue that is needed to cover the company's expenses. In other words, it is the point where the company will have exactly zero net income.
To assist in the understanding of a company's break-even point, its expenses are sorted into fixed expenses, variable expenses, and semivariable or mixed expenses.
Examples of Causes for an Increase in the Break-even Point
Some of the reasons why a company's break-even point will increase are:

An increase in the company's fixed expenses. These include rent, depreciation, salaries of managers and executives, etc.
A reduction in the contribution margin. Contribution margin is sales minus the variable expenses. Hence, an increase in the variable expenses without a corresponding increase in selling prices will cause the contribution margin to be reduced. With less contribution margin, the company will need more sales to cover its fixed expenses.
A reduction in the contribution margin caused by a decrease in selling prices.
A less favorable sales mix. Since some products (and services) have lower contribution margins than others, if a greater proportion of the lower contribution margin items are sold, the company will need to sell more units, thereby increasing the company's break-even point.",what
What is marginal cost?,"Marginal cost is the cost of the next unit or one additional unit of volume or output.
To illustrate marginal cost let's assume that the total cost of producing 10,000 units is $50,000. If you produce a total of 10,001 units the total cost is $50,002. That would mean the marginal cost—the cost of producing the next unit—was $2.
The reason that the marginal cost was $2 instead of the previous average cost of $5 ($50,000 divided by 10,000 units) is that some costs did not increase when the additional unit was produced. For example, fixed costs such as salaries, depreciation, property taxes generally do not increase when one additional unit is produced.",what
How do you reduce a company's break-even point?,"The formula for a product's break-even point expressed in units is: Total Fixed Costs divided by Contribution Margin per Unit. The contribution margin per unit is the product's selling price minus its variable costs and expenses. Fixed costs and fixed expenses are those which do not change as volume changes. Variable costs and expenses increase as volume increases and they will decrease when volume decreases.
To reduce a company's break-even point you could reduce the amount of fixed costs. When an automobile manufacturer cuts thousands of salaried positions and closes assembly plants that are not fully utilized, the company is reducing its fixed costs by hundreds of millions of dollars each year. Having fewer fixed costs means fewer car sales will be required to cover them.
You can also reduce the break-even point by increasing the contribution margin per unit. The contribution margin will increase if there is a reduction in variable costs and expenses per unit. For example, if a car company can obtain components at a reduced cost, the variable costs decrease. The reduced variable costs means that the contribution margin increased.
The contribution margin will also increase if the company is able to increase its selling prices. (Of course the company must be careful that the increased selling price does not cause fewer unit sales.)
Perhaps a combination of reduced fixed costs, reduced variable costs, and slight increases in prices is possible. Some products might be redesigned to provide unique features that customers will pay for and the additional revenue is greater than the variable costs required to add those features.
Reality is more complicated than a simple formula because companies have more than one product, competition may not allow for increasing selling prices, contracts may not allow certain actions, etc.",what
What is the difference between expense and loss?,"Definition of Expense
An expense is a cost that a company incurs or uses up when it earns revenues.
Examples of Expenses
A few examples of the many expenses that a company incurs in earning revenues are:

Cost of goods sold
Sales commissions expense
Delivery expense
Rent expense
Salaries expense
Advertising expense

Definition of Loss
A loss could have several meanings. The following examples illustrate how the term is used.
Examples of Losses
Some examples of losses include:

The sale of a long-lived asset for an amount that is less than the asset's book value
An unfavorable settlement of a lawsuit against the company
The retirement of bonds payable at a cost that is greater than the carrying value of the bonds

Loss is also used to describe write-down of inventory from cost to market.
Finally, loss is also used to describe the bottom line of an income statement that reports expenses in excess of revenues.

What is elastic demand?,"Definition of Elastic Demand
Elastic demand is the situation in which demand for a product or service is sensitive to price changes. 
Elastic demand is a major concern for a manufacturer that attempts to set a product's price based on the product's costs. For instance, if the manufacturer's production and sales have declined and it fails to cut fixed costs, the manufacturer could be worse off by increasing selling prices. It could even lead to a death spiral.
Examples of Elastic Demand
If the selling price of a product is increased, the number of units sold will decrease. If the selling price of a product is decreased, the number of units sold will increase. Elastic demand is also referred to as the price elasticity of demand.
[Inelastic demand means that the demand for a product is not sensitive to price changes.]",what
What is a fixed expense?,"Definition of Fixed Expense
A fixed expense is an expense whose total amount does not change when there is an increase in an activity such as sales or production. The words within a relevant or reasonable range of activity are normally added to the definition because at an extremely high volume or low volume, a change will likely occur.
Examples of Fixed Expenses
Let's assume that a retailer's monthly rent is $2,000. If the rent will remain at $2,000 whether the monthly sales are $15,000 or $30,000, we will say that the rent is a fixed expense. (Of course, if sales triple or drop to be 20% of the normal amount, the rent will likely have to change. Nonetheless, the present rent of $2,000 is considered to be a fixed expense since the extreme conditions are outside of the relevant range for short-term analyses.)
Other examples of expenses that are likely to be fixed within a reasonable range of retail sales include:

The store manager's annual salary
The depreciation expense for the buildings, fixtures, and equipment
The fixed contracts for security, maintenance fees, phones, internet service, insurance, lighting, advertising, etc.

Knowing the amount of a company's fixed expenses assists in understanding how the retailer's net income will change as volume changes. The total amount of fixed expenses can also be used to quickly estimate a company's break-even point.",what
What is sales mix?,"Definition of Sales Mix
Sales mix is the relative proportion or ratio of a business's products that are sold. Sales mix is important because a company's products usually have different degrees of profitability. Sales mix also applies to service businesses since the services provided will likely have different levels of profitability.
Example of Sales Mix
Let's assume that an automobile company plans to sell 100,000 units in the current year. The planned sales mix is 20,000 units of very-low-profit models + 50,000 units of medium-profit models + 30,000 units of very-high-profit models. In other words, the planned sales mix is 20%, 50%, 30%. With this volume and sales mix the company is planning to have a small operating loss.
Now let's assume that the total units actually sold were only 95,000 units. Having 5,000 fewer units sold could mean a huge operating loss. However, the company's loss (or profit) depends on the actual sales mix. What if the actual sales indicates that 15% of 95,000 units sold were the very-low-profit units, 45% of the sales were the medium-profit units were sold, and 40% of the sales were the very-high-profit units. In other words, this more favorable sales mix (15-45-40 instead of 20-50-30) could result in an operating profit (instead of the planned loss) even with 5,000 fewer units sold.",what
Why does the fixed cost per unit change?,"Fixed costs such as rent or a supervisor's salary will not change in total within a reasonable range of volume or activity. For example, the rent might be $2,500 per month and the supervisor's salary might be $3,500 per month. This total fixed cost of $6,000 per month will be the same whether the volume is 3,000 units or 4,000 units.
On the other hand, the fixed cost per unit will change as the level of volume or activity changes. Using the amounts above, the fixed cost per unit is $2 when the volume is 3,000 units ($6,000 divided by 3,000 units). When the volume is 4,000 units, the fixed cost per unit is $1.50 ($6,000 divided by 4,000 units).",what
What is the coefficient of correlation?,"Definition of Coefficient of Correlation
In simple linear regression analysis, the coefficient of correlation (or correlation coefficient) is a statistic which indicates an association between the independent variable and the dependent variable. The coefficient of correlation is represented by ""r"" and it has a range of -1.00 to +1.00. 
When the coefficient of correlation is a positive amount, such as +0.80, it means the dependent variable is increasing when the independent variable is increasing. It also means that the dependent variable is decreasing when the independent variable is decreasing. However, a high positive correlation does not guarantee there is a cause and effect relationship. (A negative amount indicates an inverse association...the dependent variable is decreasing when the independent variable is increasing and vice versa.)
A coefficient of correlation of +0.8 or -0.8 indicates a strong correlation between the independent variable and the dependent variable. An r of +0.20 or -0.20 indicates a weak correlation between the variables. When the coefficient of correlation is 0.00 there is no correlation.
Relationship of Coefficient of Correlation to Coefficient of Determination
When the coefficient of correlation is squared, it becomes the coefficient of determination. This means that a coefficient of correlation of +0.80 will result in a coefficient of determination of 0.64 or 64%. (The coefficient of determination of 0.64 tells you that 64% of the change in the total of the dependent variable is associated with the change in the independent variable.) An r of +0.20 or -0.20 will result in an r-squared of only 4% (0.20 x 0.20), which means that only 4% of the change in the dependent variable is explained by the change in the independent variable.",what
What is a variable cost?,"A variable cost is a constant amount per unit produced or used. Therefore, the total amount of the variable cost will change proportionately with volume or activity. Generally, a product's direct materials are a variable cost.
To illustrate, let's assume that a bakery uses one pound of flour at a cost of $0.70 per pound for every loaf of bread it produces. If no bread is produced the total cost of flour is $0. If one loaf is produced the total cost of flour is $0.70. When 10 loaves are produced the total cost of flour is $7.00. At the volume of 30 loaves the cost of flour is $21 (30 loaves X 1 pound X $0.70 per pound).
An expense can also be a variable cost. For instance, if a company pays a 5% sales commission on every sale, the company's sales commission expense will be a variable cost. When the company has no sales the total sales commission expense is $0. When sales are $100,000 the sales commission expense will be $5,000. Sales of $200,000 will mean total sales commission expense of $10,000. Sales of $400,000 will result in total sales commission expense of $20,000.",what
What are the methods for separating mixed costs into fixed and variable?,"I know of three methods for separating mixed costs into their fixed and variable cost components:

Prepare a scattergraph by plotting points onto a graph.
High-low method.
Regression analysis.

It is wise to prepare the scattergraph even if you use the high-low method or regression analysis. The benefit of the scattergraph is that it allows you to see if some of the plotted points are simply out of line. These points are referred to as outliers and will need to be reviewed and possibly adjusted or eliminated. In other words, you don't want incorrect data to distort your calculations under any of the three methods.
Let's assume that a company uses only one type of equipment and it wants to know how much of the monthly electricity bill is a constant amount and how much the electricity bill will increase when its equipment runs for an additional hour. The scattergraph's vertical or y-axis will indicate the dollars of total monthly electricity cost. Its horizontal or x-axis will indicate the number of equipment hours. For each monthly electricity bill, a point will be entered on the graph at the intersection of the dollar amount of the total electricity bill and the equipment hours occurring between the meter reading dates shown on the electricity bill. If you plot this information for the most recent 12 months, you may see some type of pattern, such as a line that rises as the number of equipment hours increase.
If you draw a line through the plotted points and extend the line through the y-axis, the amount where the line crosses the y-axis is the approximate amount of fixed costs for each month. The slope of the line indicates the variable cost per equipment hour. The slope or variable rate is the increase in the total monthly electricity cost divided by the change in the total number of equipment hours.
The high-low calculation is similar but it uses only two of the plotted points: the highest point and the lowest point.
Regression analysis uses all of the monthly electricity bill amounts along with their related number of equipment hours in order to calculate the monthly fixed cost of electricity and the variable rate for each equipment hour. Software can be used for regression analysis and it will also provide statistical insights.
If  a scattergraph of data shows no clear pattern, you should not place much confidence in the calculated amount of  the fixed cost and variable rate regardless of the method used.",what
How do you reduce the break-even point?,"Ways to reduce a company's break-even point include 1) reducing the amount of fixed costs, 2) reducing the variable costs per unit—thereby increasing the unit's contribution margin, 3) improving the sales mix by selling a greater proportion of the products having larger contribution margins, and 4) increasing selling prices so long as the number of units sold will not decline significantly.",what
Is contribution margin the same as operating income?,"Contribution margin is different from operating income.
Contribution margin is revenues minus the variable costs and expenses. For example, a retailer's contribution margin is sales minus the cost of goods sold and the variable selling expenses and the variable administrative expenses and any variable nonoperating expenses. (Perhaps some interest expense varies with sales.)
A retailer's operating income is sales minus the cost of goods sold and all selling and administrative expenses (fixed and variable). Operating income is the net income before the nonoperating items such as interest revenue, interest expense, gain or loss on the sale of plant assets, etc.
Contribution margin is used to determine the Break-even Point.",what
What is the difference between break-even point and payback period?,"Break-even point is the volume of sales or services that will result in no net income or net loss on a company's income statement. In other words, the break-even point focuses on the revenues needed to equal exactly all of the expenses on a single income statement prepared under the accrual method of accounting.
The break-even point in dollars of revenues can be calculated by dividing a company's total fixed expenses by its contribution margin ratio. The break-even calculation assumes that the selling prices, contribution margin ratio, and fixed expenses will not change.
Payback period is the number of years needed for a company to receive net cash inflows that aggregate to the amount of an initial cash investment. Hence the payback period focuses on the pertinent cash flows of multiple accounting years instead of the net income of a single accounting period. The payback period is often computed when evaluating potential capital expenditures. However, the payback period is considered to be flawed because it ignores 1) the cash flows occurring after the payback period, and 2) the time value of money.
AccountingCoach PRO contains a cost and managerial accounting exam with 520 questions (with answers) to learn or review topics such as break-even.",what
What is a fixed cost?,"A fixed cost is one that does not change in total within a reasonable range of activity. For example, the rent for a production facility is a fixed cost if the rent will not change when there are reasonable changes in the amount of output or input. (Of course, if there is a need to double the output the rent will change when the company occupies additional work space.)
While a fixed cost remains constant in total, the fixed cost per unit of output or input will change inversely with the change in the quantity of output or input. For instance, if the rent of the production facility is fixed at $120,000 per year and there are 30,000 machine hours of good output during the year, the rent will be $4 ($120,000/30,000) per machine hour. If there are 40,000 machine hours during the year, the rent will be $3 ($120,000/40,000) per machine hour.
Many manufacturing overhead costs are fixed and the amounts occur in large increments. Some examples include depreciation on a company-owned factory, depreciation on machinery and equipment, salaries and benefits of manufacturing supervisors, factory administration costs, etc. One challenge for accountants is the allocation or assigning of the large fixed costs to the individual units of product (which likely vary in size and complexity). This allocation (or assigning or absorbing) is required by the accounting and income tax rules for valuing inventories and the cost of goods sold. If the fixed overhead is assigned using machine hours, one must keep in mind that the cost rate per machine hour is not how the fixed costs behave or occur. In our example, the cost of the rent might be assigned to the products at the rate of $3 or $4 per machine hour but the rent actually occurs at the rate of $10,000 per month.",what
What is a learning curve?,"A common learning curve shows that the cumulative average time to complete a manual task which involves learning will decrease 20% whenever volume doubles. This is referred to as an 80% learning curve.
Let's illustrate the 80% learning curve with a person learning to design and code websites of similar size and complexity. If the first website takes 100 hours, then after the second website the cumulative average time will be 80 hours (80% of 100 hours). The cumulative average of 80 hours consists of 100 hours for the first website plus only 60 hours for the second website resulting in a total of 160 hours divided by 2 websites. After the fourth website the cumulative average time will be 64 hours (80% of 80 hours). After the eighth website the cumulative average will be 51.2 hours (80% of 64 hours). In other words, the total time to have completed all eight websites will be 409.6 hours (8 websites times an average time of 51.2 hours).
Improvements in technology can mean time and cost reductions beyond those in the learning curve. For example, software may become available to assist in the design and coding, computer processing speeds might increase, there may be lower costs of processing and storage, etc.
The learning curve is important for setting standards, estimating costs, and establishing selling prices.",what
"Is the cost of land, buildings, and machinery a fixed cost?","Some people refer to land, buildings, and machinery as fixed assets. They are also referred to as plant assets, or as property, plant, and equipment.
The depreciation expense on the buildings and machinery is often viewed as a fixed cost or fixed expense. Hence, in the calculation of the break-even point, the annual depreciation expense on the fixed assets other than land is part of the fixed costs or fixed expenses. There is no depreciation of land.",what
What is a variable expense?,"An expense is a variable expense when its total amount changes in proportion to the change in sales, production, or some other activity. 
To illustrate a variable expense, let's assume that a website business sells a product and requires that the customer use a credit card. The credit card processor charges the business a fee of 3% of the amount charged. Therefore, in a month when sales are $10,000 the business will have a credit card expense of $300. If sales are $30,000 there will be a credit card expense of $900. The total credit card expense varies with sales because the fee has a fixed rate of 3% of sales.
Another example of a variable expense is a retailer's cost of goods sold. For instance, if a company purchases a product for $30 and then sells it for $50, its cost of goods sold will be a constant rate of 60%. Hence when its sales are $10,000 the cost of goods will be $6,000. When the sales are $30,000 the cost of goods sold will be $18,000.
Knowing how costs behave when sales or other activities change will allow you to better understand how a company's net income will change. It also allows you to quickly calculate a product's contribution margin and to estimate the company's break-even point.",what
How do we deal with a negative contribution margin ratio when calculating our break-even point?,"The negative contribution margin ratio indicates that your variable costs and expenses exceed your sales. In other words, if you increase your sales in the same proportion as the past, you will experience larger losses.
My recommendation is to calculate the contribution margin and contribution margin ratio for each product (or service) that you offer. I suspect that some of your items have positive contribution margins, but the products with negative contribution margins are greater. You must get into the details.
You also need to look at each of your customers. Perhaps some customers are buying in huge quantities, but those sales are not profitable. See which customers have positive contribution margins.
By definition, the ways to eliminate the negative contribution margin are to 1) raise selling prices, 2) reduce variable costs, or 3) do some combination of the first two. If customers will not accept price increases in order for you to cover your variable costs, you are probably better off not having the sales. Remember that after covering the variable costs, those selling prices must then cover the fixed costs and expenses. A total negative contribution margin means your loss will be larger than the amount of the fixed costs and expenses.
When setting prices or bidding for new work, you must think of the bottom line—profits. Many people focus too much on the top line—sales.",what
What is the difference between a differential cost and an incremental cost?,"I use the terms differential cost and incremental cost interchangeably. In other words, I believe the terms mean the same thing: the difference in cost between two alternatives. For example, if a company determined that the annual cost of operating at 80,000 machine hours was $4,000,000 while the annual cost of operating at 70,000 machine hours was $3,800,000, then the differential cost or incremental cost of the additional 10,000 machine hours was $200,000.
The term marginal cost refers to the cost of operating for one additional machine hour.",what
What are semivariable costs?,"Semivariable costs are costs or expenses whose behavior is partially fixed and partially variable. Semivariable costs are also referred to as mixed costs.
A common example of a semivariable cost is the annual cost of operating a vehicle. Some of the vehicle's operating costs will vary with the number of miles driven while other costs will be the same in total regardless of the miles driven. For example, the vehicle's fuel costs will be variable. However, the depreciation, insurance and licensing may be fixed. Looking only at the vehicle's maintenance costs may indicate that some maintenance is done each November (regardless of the number of miles driven) while other maintenance is done every 6,000 miles.
A manufacturer's electricity cost is another example of a semivariable cost. Part of the monthly electricity bill will include 1) a fixed amount, and 2) a separate amount based on the number of kilowatt hours of electricity actually used by the company.
The manufacturer's electricity cost is also a semivariable cost in relationship with the company's machine hours. The portion of the electricity cost used to operate the production equipment is variable, but the portion of the electricity cost used for lighting and air conditioning the manufacturing facility is a fixed cost.
These simple examples illustrate that it can be difficult to understand how costs behave. There are many factors, activities, and drivers that influence the level of costs.",what
What is simple linear regression analysis?,"Simple linear regression analysis is a statistical tool for quantifying the relationship between just one independent variable (hence ""simple"") and one dependent variable based on past experience (observations). For example, simple linear regression analysis can be used to express how a company's electricity cost (the dependent variable) changes as the company's production machine hours (the independent variable) change.
Fortunately there is software to compute the best fitting straight line (hence ""linear"") that expresses the past relationship between the dependent and independent variable. Continuing our example, you will enter 1) the amount of the past monthly electricity bills, and 2) the number of machine hours occurring during the period of each of the bills. Next, the software will likely use the least squares method to produce the formula for the best fitting line. The line will appear in the form y = a + bx. In addition, the software will provide statistics regarding the correlation, confidence, dispersion around the line, and more.
(In all likelihood there are many independent variables causing a change in the amount of the dependent variable. Therefore, you should not expect that only one independent variable will explain a high percentage of the change in the dependent variable. To increase the percentage, you should think of the many independent variables that could cause a change in the dependent variable. Next you should test the effect of the combination of these independent variables or drivers by using multiple regression analysis software.)
Prior to using simple linear regression analysis it is important to follow these preliminary steps:

seek an independent variable that is likely to cause or drive the change in the dependent variable
make certain that the past amounts for the independent variable occur in the exact same period as the amount of the dependent variable
plot the past observations on a graph using the y-axis for the cost (monthly electricity bill) and the x-axis for the activity (machine hours used during the exact period of the electricity bill)
review the plotted observations for a linear pattern and for any outliers
keep in mind that there can be correlation without cause and effect",what
What increases a break-even point?,"The break-even point will increase when the amount of fixed costs and expenses increases. The break-even point will also increase when the variable expenses increase without a corresponding increase in the selling prices.
A company with many products can see its break-even point increase when the mix of products changes. In other words, if a greater proportion of lower contribution margin products are sold, the break-even point will increase. (Contribution margin is selling price minus variable expenses.)",what
What does stepped cost mean?,"Stepped cost refers to the behavior of the total cost of an activity at various levels of the activity. When a stepped cost is plotted on a graph (with the total cost represented by the y-axis and the quantity of the activity represented by the x-axis) the lines will appear as steps or stairs rising from left to right.
To illustrate a stepped cost, let's assume that you are developing a website and find that the monthly cost of hosting the site is based on the number of visits. For 0 to 999 visits per month, the cost is $20 per month. When the visits are in the range of 1,000 to 2,999 the monthly cost jumps to $50. If the visits are 3,000 to 9,999 the cost will be $200 per month. For monthly visits of 10,000 to 24,999 the cost is $300, and so on. As the data indicates, the total monthly cost is constant or fixed only for a given range of activity (number of visits). When the number of visits exceeds the upper limit of a range, the monthly cost jumps to a higher level and remains fixed until the visits exceed the new upper limit.
A stepped cost is also referred to as a step cost, a step-variable cost, or a step-fixed cost. The difference between a step-variable cost and a step-fixed cost has to do with the width of the range of activity. If the total cost increases with small increases in activity, it may be referred to as a step-variable cost. If the total cost will change only with large increases in the quantity of activity, the term step-fixed cost is more likely to be used.
Knowing how costs behave is important for decision making. For example, a manufacturer will want to know how its costs will increase if a new product line is added (or how costs could decrease if an existing product line is eliminated).",what
Are insurance premiums a fixed cost?,"The cost of the insurance premiums for a company's property insurance is likely to be a fixed cost. The cost of worker compensation insurance is likely to be a variable cost. Whether a cost is a fixed cost, a variable cost, or a mixed cost depends on the independent variable.
Let's illustrate this by looking at the cost of property insurance. The cost of insuring the factory building is a fixed cost when the independent variable is the number of units produced within the factory. In other words, the factory's property insurance might be $6,000 per year whether its output is 2 million units, 3 million units, or 5 million units. On the other hand, if the independent variable is the replacement cost of the factory buildings, the insurance cost will be a variable cost. The reason is the insurance cost on $12 million of factory buildings will be more than the insurance cost on $9 million of factory buildings, and less than the insurance premiums on $18 million of factory buildings.
In the case of worker compensation insurance, the cost will vary with the amount of payroll dollars (excluding overtime premium) in each class of workers. For example, if the worker comp premiums are $5 per $100 of factory labor cost, then the worker comp premiums will be variable with respect to the dollars of factory labor cost. If the units of output in the factory correlate with the direct labor costs, then the worker compensation cost will also be variable with respect to the number of units produced. On the other hand, the worker compensation cost for the office staff is usually a much smaller rate and that worker compensation cost will not be variable with respect to the number of units of output in the factory. However, the worker compensation cost of the office staff will be variable with respect to the amount of office staff salaries and wages.
As you have seen, determining which costs are fixed and which are variable can be a bit tricky.",what
What happens when the high-low method ends up with a negative amount?,"The high-low method of determining the fixed and variable portions of a mixed cost relies on only two sets of data: 1) the costs at the highest level of activity, and 2) the costs at the lowest level of activity. If either set of data is flawed, the calculation can result in an unreasonable, negative amount of fixed cost.
To illustrate the problem, let's assume that the total cost is $1,200 when there are 100 units of product manufactured, and $6,000 when there are 400 units of product are manufactured. The high-low method computes the variable cost rate by dividing the change in the total costs by the change in the number of units of manufactured. In other words, the $4,800 change in total costs is divided by the change in units of 300 to yield the variable cost rate of $16 per unit of product. Since the fixed costs are the total costs minus the variable costs, the fixed costs will be calculated to a negative $400. This unacceptable answer results from total costs of $1,200 at the low point minus the variable costs of $1,600 (100 units times $16), or total costs of $6,000 at the high point minus the variable costs of $6,400 (400 units times $16).
The negative amount of fixed costs is not realistic and leads me to believe that either the total costs at either the high point or at the low point are not representative. This brings to light the importance of plotting or graphing all of the points of activity and their related costs before using the high-low method. (The number of units uses the scale on the x-axis and the related total cost at each level of activity uses the scale on the y-axis.) It is possible that at the highest point of activity the costs were out of line from the normal relationship—referred to as an outlier. You may decide to use the second highest level of activity, if the related costs are more representative.
If the $6,000 of cost at the 400 units of activity is an outlier, you might select the next highest activity of 380 units having total costs of $4,000. Now the variable rate will be the change in total costs of $2,800 ($4,000 minus $1,200) divided by the change in the units manufactured of 280 (380 minus 100) for a variable rate of $10 per unit of product. Using the variable rate of $10 per unit manufactured will result in the fixed costs being a positive $200. The positive $200 of fixed costs is calculated at either 1) the low activity: total costs of $1,200 minus the variable costs of $1,000 (100 units at $10); or at 2) the high activity: total costs of $4,000 minus the variable costs of $3,800 (380 units at $10).",what
Why would the cost behavior change outside of the relevant range of activity?,"Cost behavior often changes outside of the relevant range of activity due to a change in the fixed costs. When volume increases to a certain point, more fixed costs will have to be added. When volume shrinks significantly, some fixed costs could be eliminated.
Here's an illustration. A company manufactures products in its 100,000 square foot plant. The company's depreciation on the plant is $1,000,000 per year. The capacity of the plant is 500,000 units of output and its normal output is 400,000 units per year. When the company is manufacturing between 300,000 and 500,000 units, it needs salaried managers earning $400,000 per year. Below 300,000 units of output, some of the salaried manager positions would be eliminated. Above 500,000 units, the company will need to add plant space and managers.
For this example, the relevant range is between 300,000 units and 500,000 units of output per year. In that range the total of the two fixed costs is $1,400,000 per year. Below 300,000 units, the fixed costs will drop to less than $1,400,000 because some salaries will be eliminated and some of the space might be rented. When the volume exceeds 500,000 units per year, the company will need to add fixed costs because of the additional space and the additional managers. Perhaps the total fixed costs will be $2,000,000 for output between 500,000 units and 700,000 units.",what
What is the break-even formula?,"Break-even Point in Units of Product
The formula for determining the break-even point in units of product sold is: total fixed expenses divided by the contribution margin per unit. For example, if a company's total fixed expenses for a year are $300,000 and it has a contribution margin of $4 per unit (selling price of $10 per unit minus variable expenses of $6 per unit), the company's break-even point in sales for the year is 75,000 units.
Break-even Point in Billable Service Hours
For a service business, the units could be the company's hours billed to clients. For example, if the business has total fixed expenses of $300,000 for a year and it has a contribution margin of $40 per billable hour (hourly billing rate of $100 minus variable expenses of $60 per hour), the break-even point for the year is 7,500 hours billed at $100 per hour.
Break-even Point in Dollars of Revenue
The formula for determining the break-even point in dollars of product or services is the total fixed expenses divided by the contribution margin ratio (or %). For instance, if a company has total fixed expenses for a year of $300,000 and a contribution margin ratio of 40%, the break-even point for the year in revenue dollars is $750,000.
Limitation of Break-even Formula
The break-even formula is overly simplistic for computing a company's break-even point if the company has a wide variety of products (and/or services) with varying contribution margins and contribution margin ratios.",what
How do you determine the fixed portion of overhead cost?,"I suggest that the first step in determining the fixed portion of a mixed cost (a cost that is partially fixed and partially variable) is to graph the data. Label the vertical or y-axis of the graph as Total Manufacturing Overhead (or Total Electricity Cost if you are analyzing the individual components of overhead). Label the horizontal or x-axis of the graph as total machine hours (or some other indicator of volume). Then put a point on the graph for each of the past 12 months. If January had $100,000 of overhead and 6,000 MHs, enter a point on the graph where those two amounts intersect. After plotting all 12 months, you might see a pattern and/or you might see something unusual. Investigate the unusual before proceeding. Perhaps there was an accounting error or a very unusual situation that is not likely to recur. Once you are confident that the data is reasonable you can proceed. (Please note that the overhead costs need to be on an accrual basis. In other words, you need to have the costs that occurred when the machine hours occurred. Your data will be misleading if you relate this month's machine hours to the electricity bill that was paid this month, if that bill is for the previous month's electricity usage. Check the meter reading dates on the bill to be sure the dates of the electricity usage agree with the dates of the machine hours.)
Once you eliminated any ""outliers"" from the graph (or scattergraph) and you are confident that the dollar amounts are related to the activity on the x-axis, you can proceed. One technique is the High-Low method. This method uses only two of the points or months on your graph: the point where the MHs were the highest and the point where the MHs were the lowest...so long as those two points are not outliers. Let's assume that the highest number of MHs occurred in September. At that point the MHs were 10,000 and the total overhead cost was $140,000. Let's assume that the lowest activity occurred in January when the MHs were 6,000 and the total overhead cost was $100,000. If the range of these MHs (6,000 to 10,000) are not outside the range of normal activity, we know by definition that the fixed manufacturing costs will not change in this range as the MHs change. That means that any change in the total manufacturing costs in this range must be the change in the variable costs. Here's the formula: Variable Cost Rate = Change in total costs divided by the change in the MHs. In our example, Variable Cost Rate = $40,000 ($140,000 minus $100,000) divided by 4,000 MHs (10,000 MHs minus 6,000 MHs) equals $10 per MH. The total variable costs at the lowest activity = 6,000 MH times $10 variable rate = $60,000. Since the total overhead costs were $100,000 the fixed costs must have been $40,000. At the highest level of activity, the total variable costs = 10,000 MHs X $10 = $100,000. Since the total costs at this level were $140,000 the fixed costs must be $40,000. So we estimate (based on just two points) that the manufacturing overhead is $40,000 per month + $10 per MH.
A more sophisticated method for separating the fixed costs from the mixed costs would be to use all of the points (rather than only the highest and lowest). The technique to accomplish this is regression analysis. The use of regression analysis not only gives you the best equation for all the points, it also generates statistics on how much of the change in manufacturing overhead is caused by the MHs. Undoubtedly you will find that MHs are causing only part of the change in the overhead costs. This feedback is important if it prompts you to identify the other variables that are causing the manufacturing overhead costs to change.
In summary, the High-Low method is an overly simplistic tool. Be careful and spend time understanding the relationships between activities and costs. Manufacturing processes and costs are probably driven by many activities (not just MHs) and not all products may require the same activities.",what
How much of the contribution margin is profit on units sold in excess of the break-even point? ,"After the break-even point is reached, the entire contribution margin on the next units sold will be profit...provided the total fixed costs and expenses do not increase.
The reason lies in the definition of contribution margin: selling price minus the variable costs and expenses. Once the contribution margins have covered the total amount of fixed costs and expenses, the entire contribution margin on the next units will go to profit.",what
How do I calculate the after-tax cost of debt?,"Definition of After-Tax Cost of Debt
The after-tax cost of debt is the interest paid on the debt minus the income tax savings as the result of deducting the interest expense on the company's income tax return.
Example of After-Tax Cost of Debt
Let's assume that a regular U.S. corporation has:

A loan with an annual interest rate of 10%
An incremental tax rate of 30% (combination of federal and state)

If the corporation has a loan of $100,000 with an annual interest rate of 10%, the interest paid to the lender will be $10,000 per year. This interest expense will reduce the corporation's taxable income by $10,000 thereby saving the corporation $3,000 in income taxes (30% tax rate on $10,000 reduction in taxable income).
The after-tax cost of the debt is computed as follows: $10,000 paid to the lender minus $3,000 of income tax savings equals a net cost of $7,000 per year on the $100,000 loan. This means the after-tax cost is 7% ($7,000 divided by $100,000) per year.
Using the example above, the after-tax interest rate can also be calculated. The formula for the after-tax rate is: the loan interest rate of 10% minus (30% tax savings on the 10% interest rate) = 10% minus 3% = 7%.",what
What does per annum mean?,"Definition of Per Annum
Per annum means yearly or annually. It is a common phrase used to describe an interest rate. Often ""per annum"" is omitted, as in ""I have a 4% mortgage loan."" or ""This bond pays interest of 6%.""
Example of Per Annum
An example involves a supplier offering a credit customer an early-payment discount of 2% for paying an invoice in 10 days instead of paying the full amount in 30 days. In this example the supplier is giving up 2% of the invoice amount in order to be paid 20 days early.
To compute the rate per annum we restate the amounts by multiplying both the ""2%"" and the ""20 days"" by 18 (in order to get close to the 365 days in a year). The result is a per annum rate of approximately 36%.
Another example involves a business charging its customers 1.5% per month on any past due balance. The monthly rate of 1.5% can be converted to 18% per annum by multiplying the 1.5% times 12 months in a year.",what
What is the high-low method?,"The high-low method is a simple technique for computing the variable cost rate and the total amount of fixed costs that are part of mixed costs. Mixed costs are costs that are partially variable and partially fixed. The cost of electricity used in a factory is likely to be a mixed cost since some of the electricity will vary with the number of machine hours, while some of the cost will not vary with machine hours. Perhaps this second part of the electricity cost is associated with circulating and chilling the air in the factory and from the public utility billing its large customers with a significant fixed monthly charge not directly tied to the kilowatt hours of electricity used.
The high-low method uses two sets of numbers: 1) the total dollars of the mixed costs occurring at the highest volume of activity, and 2) the total dollars of the mixed costs occurring at the lowest volume of activity. It is assumed that at both points of activity the total amount of fixed costs is the same. Therefore, the change in the total costs is assumed to be the variable cost rate times the change in the number of units of activity. Prior to using the high-low method, it is important to plot or graph all of the data available to be certain that the two sets of numbers being used are indeed representative.
To illustrate the high-low method, let's assume that a company had total costs of electricity of $18,000 in the month when its highest activity was 120,000 machine hours. (Be sure to match the dates of the machine hours to the electric meter reading dates.) During the month of its lowest activity there were 100,000 machine hours and the total cost of electricity was $16,000. This means that the total monthly cost of electricity changed by $2,000 when the number of machine hours changed by 20,000. This indicates that the variable cost rate was $0.10 per machine hour.
Continuing with this example, if the total electricity cost was $18,000 when there were 120,000 machine hours, the variable portion is assumed to have been $12,000 (120,000 machine hours times $0.10). Since the total electricity cost was $18,000 and the variable cost was calculated to be $12,000, the fixed cost of electricity for the month must have been the $6,000. If we use the lowest level of activity, the total cost of $16,000 would include $10,000 of variable cost (100,000 machine hours times $0.10) with the remainder of $6,000 being the fixed cost for the month.",what
What is the contribution margin ratio?,"Definition of Contribution Margin Ratio
The contribution margin ratio is the percentage of sales revenues, service revenues, or selling price remaining after subtracting all of the variable costs and variable expenses. 
Expressed another way, the contribution margin ratio is the percentage of revenues that is available to cover a company's fixed costs, fixed expenses, and profit.
Note that the contribution margin ratio is not the same as the gross margin ratio or gross profit percentage. Further, the contribution margin ratio cannot be computed from the amounts appearing on a company's external income statement.
Example of Contribution Margin Ratio
Assume that a company manufactures and sells a single product and has the following information:

Selling price per unit is $20
Fixed manufacturing costs per month is $18,000
Variable manufacturing costs per unit is $4
Fixed SG&A expenses per month is $12,000
Variable SG&A expenses per unit is $2
Fixed interest expense per month is $1,000

Using the above information the contribution margin per unit is $14 (the selling price of $20 minus the variable manufacturing costs of $4 and variable SG&A expenses of $2). Therefore, the contribution margin ratio is 70% (the contribution margin per unit of $14 divided by the selling price of $20). This contribution margin ratio tells us that 70% of the sales revenues (or 70% of the selling price) is available to cover the company's $31,000 of monthly fixed costs and fixed expenses ($18,000 + $12,000 + $1,000). Once the $31,000 has been covered, 70% of the revenues will flow to the company's net income.",what
What is gross margin?,"Definition of Gross Margin
Gross margin is the amount remaining after a retailer or manufacturer subtracts its cost of goods sold from its net sales. In other words, gross margin is the retailer's or manufacturer's profit before subtracting its selling, general and administrative, and interest expenses.
Gross Margin Can be an Amount or an Expense
Gross margin could be expressed as:

An amount (also known as gross profit)
A percentage of net sales (also known as gross profit percentage or gross margin ratio)

The gross margin may be calculated for an individual product, a product line, or for the entire company.
Examples of Gross Margin Calculations
If a retailer had net sales of $40,000 and its cost of goods sold was $24,000, the retailer had a gross margin of $16,000 or 40% of net sales ($16,000/$40,000).
A manufacturer sells a product for $40 and its cost of goods sold (which consists of its manufacturing costs) is $28. Therefore, the product's gross margin is $12 ($40 minus $28), or 30% of the selling price ($12/$40).
Difference Between Gross Margin and Profit Margin
Gross margin is the amount or percent before subtracting the selling, general and administrative, and interest expenses. Profit margin is the amount or percent after the selling, general and administrative, and interest expenses are subtracted. For example, a chain of grocery stores many have a gross margin of 20%, but its profit margin may be 1% (of net sales).
What the Gross Margin Tells You
Analysts track a company's gross margin percentage to determine whether the company is able to increase selling prices when costs are increasing or when competitors are reducing prices or expanding their sales efforts. The gross margin of individual products could indicate to management that some products should be promoted more aggressively and some products should be phased out.",what
How do you divide the cost of real estate into land and building?,"Dividing the Cost of Real Estate into Land and Building
In accounting, the cost of real estate must be divided into:

The cost of land (because land is not depreciated)
The cost of the structures (because these require depreciation)

Example of Dividing the Cost of Real Estate
Assume that a company purchases real estate (which includes land and a building) at a cost of $220,000. The appraisal at the time of the purchase indicates that the land has a market value of $50,000 and the building has a market value of $200,000...for a total market value of $250,000. In other words, the appraisal indicates that the land is 20% ($50,000/$250,000) of the market value, and the building is 80% ($200,000/$250,000) of the market value.
The cost principle requires that the purchase be recorded at its cost of $220,000. However, we can use the appraisal amounts as a logical way to divide up the cost of $220,000 between land and building. Here is one approach:

Assign or allocate $44,000 to the account Land. This is 20% of the $220,000 cost.
Assign or allocate $176,000 to the account Buildings. This is 80% of the $220,000 cost

A second approach is to compare the real estate's total cost of $220,000 to the total appraisal amount of $250,000. This shows that the total cost is 88% ($220,000/$250,000) of the total market value. Using this approach we will:

Assign or allocate 88% of the $50,000 market value = $44,000 to the Land account
Assign or allocate 88% of the $200,000 market value = $176,000 to the Buildings account",what
What does it mean to amortize a loan?,"Definition of Amortize a Loan
To amortize a loan usually means establishing a series of equal monthly payments that will provide the lender with:

An interest  payment based on the unpaid principal balance as of the beginning of the month
A principal payment that will cause the unpaid principal balance to decrease each month so that the principal balance will be zero at the time of the final payment

Although the total amount of each monthly payment remains the same, interest and principal payments will be changing as follows:

The interest component of each monthly payment will be decreasing (because of the monthly decline in the principal balance)
The principal component of each monthly payment will be increasing

A listing of each month's interest and principal payments along with the remaining, unpaid principal balance after each payment is known as an amortization schedule.
Example of Amortizing a Loan
Assume that a lender proposes to amortize a $60,000 loan at 4% annual interest over a 3-year period. This will require 36 monthly payments of $1,771.44 each. The first two payments will consist of the following:

Interest payment of $200.00 ($60,000 X 4% X 1/12) plus a principal payment of $1,571.44. After this payment, the principal balance will be $58,428.56 ($60,000.00 - $1,571.44)
Interest payment of $194.76 ($58,428.56 X 4% X 1/12) plus a principal payment of $1,576.68. After this payment the principal balance will be $56,851.88 ($58,428.56 - $1,576.68)

The 36th and final monthly payment of $1,771.44 will consist of interest of $5.89 (the principal balance after the 35th payment of $1,765.55 X 4% X 1/12) plus a principal payment of $1,765.55. After the 36th payment the loan balance will be zero. In other words, the loan will have been amortized over its 3-year term.",what
What do negative variances indicate?,"Definition of Negative Variances on Accounting Reports
Negative variances are the unfavorable differences between two amounts, such as:

The amount by which actual revenues were less than the budgeted revenues
The amount by which actual expenses were greater than the budgeted expenses
The amount by which actual net income was less than the budgeted net income
The amount by which current revenues were less than the previous year's revenues
The amount by which actual expenses were greater than the previous year's expenses
The amount by which the actual net income was less than the budgeted net income

The negative variances, which are unfavorable in terms of a company's profits, are usually presented in parentheses. On the other hand, positive variances in terms of a company's profits are presented without parentheses.
Examples of Negative Variances on Accounting Reports
Assume that a company had the following following information for a recent month:

Budgeted revenues of $30,000
Budgeted expenses of $22,000
Budgeted net income of $8,000
Actual revenues of $28,500
Actual expenses of $20,800
Actual net income of $7,700

Based on the above information, the company's will be reported as shown here:

Revenues variance: ($1,500). The amount is a negative or unfavorable variance because the actual revenues were $28,500 instead of the budgeted revenues of $30,000. The difference of $1,500 is unfavorable for the company's profitability.
Expenses variance: $1,200. The amount is a positive or favorable variance because the actual expenses of $20,800 are less than the budgeted expenses of $22,000. The difference of $1,200 is favorable for the company's profitability.
Net income variance: ($300). The amount is a negative or unfavorable variance because the actual net income of $7,700 is less than the budgeted net income of $8,000. The difference of ($300) is an unfavorable outcome for the company. The amount also agrees with the combination of the unfavorable revenues variance of ($1,500) and the positive expenses variance of $1,200.

To assist the readers of the accounting reports with variances being reported to indicate on the report: ""( ) = an unfavorable effect on net income.""",what
What is relevant range?,"Definition of Relevant Range
In accounting, the term relevant range usually refers to a normal range of volume or normal amount of activity in which the total amount of a company's fixed costs will not change as the volume or amount of activity changes. The term relevant range is included in the definition of fixed costs, because if a company's volume were to decline to an extremely low level, the company would take action to decrease its total amount of fixed costs. Similarly, if the company's volume were to increase dramatically, the company would likely have to increase the total amount of its fixed costs . 
Example of Relevant Range
Let's assume that a manufacturer's monthly production volume is consistently between 10,000 to 13,000 units of product requiring between 20,000 to 25,000 machine hours. Within these ranges of activity, the manufacturing operations run smoothly with the same amount of monthly fixed costs, which on average are approximately $200,000 per month for the cost of supervisors, rent, depreciation, and other fixed costs.
However, if the manufacturer's volume were to drop to say 7,000 units of product and/or to 14,000 machine hours, it would likely reduce the number of its supervisors, the space it rents, and some other fixed costs in order to reduce the $200,000 of monthly fixed costs. If the company's volume were to increase to 18,000 units of product and/or 30,000 machine hours, the company would likely have to increase its total fixed costs to pay for additional supervisors, space, and other fixed costs. Hence, an experienced accountant would say that the company's fixed costs are approximately $200,000 per month within a relevant range of activity.",what
How do you calculate opportunity costs?,"First, you will not find opportunity costs in the general ledger. The reason is that opportunity costs are the profits associated with a missed or lost opportunity. For example, if a company has a limited number of machine hours available on its large specialized machine and the setup time is four hours, the company is losing the opportunity of producing profits during those four hours.
Opportunity costs are often thought of as the lost contribution margin, which is revenues minus variable costs. If the large specialized machine is billed out to customers at $200 per hour and the variable costs of operating the machine are $80 per hour, the contribution margin and the opportunity cost is $120 per machine hour. During the four-hour setup time, the company is losing or foregoing the contribution margin of $480. In other words, its opportunity cost for the setup time is $480.
While this opportunity cost of $480 per setup cannot be recorded in the general ledger accounts, it should be considered in quoting or setting prices for customers. It should also motivate the company to look for ways to reduce the time needed to set up the machine.",what
What is a fixed budget?,"Definition of Fixed Budget
A fixed budget is a budget that does not change or flex for increases or decreases in volume. (""Volume"" could be sales, units produced, or some other activity.) A fixed budget is also known as a static budget.
Example of Fixed Budget
To illustrate a fixed budget, let's assume that a company pays a 5% sales commission on all of its sales. If the company prepares a fixed budget and it is projecting sales of $1 million, the budget for sales commissions will be fixed at $50,000. If the actual sales end up being only $900,000 the budget for sales commissions will remain unchanged at the fixed amount of $50,000. If the actual sales are $1,100,000 the budget for sales commissions will also be $50,000.
Had the company prepared a flexible budget, the budget for sales commissions would be expressed as 5% of sales. This means that the budget for sales commissions will be $50,000 only when sales are $1 million. If the company has actual sales of $900,000, the budget for sales commissions will flex and will be $45,000 (5% of $900,000). If the actual sales are $1,100,000 the budget for sales commissions will be $55,000.",what
What is the coefficient of correlation?,"Definition of Coefficient of Correlation
In simple linear regression analysis, the coefficient of correlation (or correlation coefficient) is a statistic which indicates an association between the independent variable and the dependent variable. The coefficient of correlation is represented by ""r"" and it has a range of -1.00 to +1.00. 
When the coefficient of correlation is a positive amount, such as +0.80, it means the dependent variable is increasing when the independent variable is increasing. It also means that the dependent variable is decreasing when the independent variable is decreasing. However, a high positive correlation does not guarantee there is a cause and effect relationship. (A negative amount indicates an inverse association...the dependent variable is decreasing when the independent variable is increasing and vice versa.)
A coefficient of correlation of +0.8 or -0.8 indicates a strong correlation between the independent variable and the dependent variable. An r of +0.20 or -0.20 indicates a weak correlation between the variables. When the coefficient of correlation is 0.00 there is no correlation.
Relationship of Coefficient of Correlation to Coefficient of Determination
When the coefficient of correlation is squared, it becomes the coefficient of determination. This means that a coefficient of correlation of +0.80 will result in a coefficient of determination of 0.64 or 64%. (The coefficient of determination of 0.64 tells you that 64% of the change in the total of the dependent variable is associated with the change in the independent variable.) An r of +0.20 or -0.20 will result in an r-squared of only 4% (0.20 x 0.20), which means that only 4% of the change in the dependent variable is explained by the change in the independent variable.",what
What is yield to maturity?,"Yield to maturity is the total return that will be earned by someone who purchases a bond and holds it until its maturity date. The yield to maturity might also be referred to as yield, internal rate of return, or the market interest rate at the time that the bond was purchased by the investor. The yield to maturity is expressed as an annual percentage rate.
To illustrate, let's assume that a 5% $100,000 bond will mature in 5 years and will pay interest each June 1 and December 1. Hence the bond will pay interest of $2,500 every six months until it matures. If the current market interest rate for this type of bond is 6%, the bond's current market value will be less than $100,000. The market value of a 5% bond in a 6% bond market will be approximately $95,735. This is the present value of the $2,500 of interest that will be received every six months for 5 years plus the present value of the $100,000 that will be received at the end of 5 years. (All of the cash amounts are discounted by the market interest rate. However, the 6% annual market rate will be restated to be 3% per semiannual period and the 5 years will be restated to be 10 semiannnual periods.)
The investor's yield to maturity will be the market rate of 6% (even though the bond's stated rate is 5%) consisting of the following two components:

the current yield of more than 5.2% because the investor is receiving cash of $2,500 every six months ($5,000 per year) on an investment of only $95,735.
a gain of $4,265 because the investor bought the bond for $95,735 but will receive cash of $100,000 at maturity.",what
What are the limitations of the payback period?,"The payback period (which tells the number of years needed to recover the amount of cash that was initially invested) has two limitations or drawbacks:

The net incremental cash flows are usually not adjusted for the time value of money. This means that a net incremental cash inflow of $50,000 in the fourth year of an investment is deemed to have the same value or purchasing power as a $50,000 cash outflow that was part of the initial investment made four years earlier.
The incremental cash flows received after the payback period are ignored. Let's illustrate what this means by using two hypothetical projects which are being considered as an investment:

Project #187 has a payback period of 4 years. However, the amounts of the net incremental cash inflows are expected to decline beginning in Year 4 and are expected to end in Year 7.
Project #188 has a payback period of 6 years. However, the amounts of its net incremental cash inflows are positive and are expected to grow exponentially from Year 4 through Year 15.

While Project #187's payback period is faster, Project #188 is a significantly better investment. Hence, the limitation of using the payback period for ranking potential investments.",what
What is simple linear regression analysis?,"Simple linear regression analysis is a statistical tool for quantifying the relationship between just one independent variable (hence ""simple"") and one dependent variable based on past experience (observations). For example, simple linear regression analysis can be used to express how a company's electricity cost (the dependent variable) changes as the company's production machine hours (the independent variable) change.
Fortunately there is software to compute the best fitting straight line (hence ""linear"") that expresses the past relationship between the dependent and independent variable. Continuing our example, you will enter 1) the amount of the past monthly electricity bills, and 2) the number of machine hours occurring during the period of each of the bills. Next, the software will likely use the least squares method to produce the formula for the best fitting line. The line will appear in the form y = a + bx. In addition, the software will provide statistics regarding the correlation, confidence, dispersion around the line, and more.
(In all likelihood there are many independent variables causing a change in the amount of the dependent variable. Therefore, you should not expect that only one independent variable will explain a high percentage of the change in the dependent variable. To increase the percentage, you should think of the many independent variables that could cause a change in the dependent variable. Next you should test the effect of the combination of these independent variables or drivers by using multiple regression analysis software.)
Prior to using simple linear regression analysis it is important to follow these preliminary steps:

seek an independent variable that is likely to cause or drive the change in the dependent variable
make certain that the past amounts for the independent variable occur in the exact same period as the amount of the dependent variable
plot the past observations on a graph using the y-axis for the cost (monthly electricity bill) and the x-axis for the activity (machine hours used during the exact period of the electricity bill)
review the plotted observations for a linear pattern and for any outliers
keep in mind that there can be correlation without cause and effect",what
What is net?,"In accounting, net usually refers to the combination of positive and negative amounts. For example, the amount of net sales is the combination of the amount of gross sales (a positive amount) and some negative amounts such as sales returns, sales allowances, and sales discounts. Hence, if gross sales are 990 and sales returns are 10, sales allowances are 5, and sales discounts 20, the net sales are 955 (990 minus 35).
Here are some additional examples of net:

net realizable value. The amount to be received in the ordinary course of business minus the costs of completion and disposal.
net property, plant and equipment. The recorded costs of the tangible noncurrent assets used in the business minus the related accumulated depreciation.
accounts receivable, net. The recorded amount of accounts receivable minus the allowance for doubtful accounts.
net cash provided by operating activities. The combination of the cash inflows and the cash outflows from a company's operations (activities outside of its investing and financing activities).
loss on disposal, net of tax. An accounting loss on the sale of a business segment minus the income taxes that were saved (avoided, sheltered) because the loss was also deductible on the company's income tax return.
net income. Revenues and gains minus expenses and losses.",what
What is ROI?,"ROI is the acronym for return on investment. Originally the objective of ROI was to relate a return (the income statement benefit) to the amount invested (such as the asset information from the balance sheet).
During the first half of the 20th century, ROI was helpful in monitoring the decentralized divisions of large diverse corporations. The ROI calculation may have divided a division's operating income by the average amount of operating assets being utilized by the division. For instance, a division with an operating income of $1 million that used $10 million of operating assets had an ROI of 10%.
A drawback of ROI is that the accounting amounts (revenues, expenses, asset book values, etc.) ignore the time value of money. As a result, companies began using discounted cash flows to better assess the profitability of its investments. Calculations such as net present value and internal rate of return became common and ROI was referred to as the accounting rate of return.
In the 21st century we see ROI used in the context of internet marketing and the adoption of wellness programs at large companies. In these examples the income statement benefits (more sales, lower health insurance expense) are related to the amounts being spent. Here, too, the ROI calculations do not consider the time value of money.",what
What is a flexible budget variance?,"Definition of Flexible Budget and Flexible Budget Variance
First, a flexible budget is a budget in which some amounts will increase or decrease when the level of activity changes. A flexible budget variance is the difference between 1) an actual amount, and 2) the amount allowed by the flexible budget.
Static Budget vs. Flexible Budget
To help in understanding the flexible budget variance, let's assume that you are the manager of a company's shipping department. You prepared the department's annual budget based on the company's assumption that 50,000 items will be shipped during the budget year. If the annual budget is not changed when more or less than 50,000 items are shipped, it is referred to as a static budget. A summary of the department's static budget based on shipping 50,000 items is:
Fixed expenses (salaries, utilities, etc.) of $350,000 + variable expenses (cartons, helpers, etc.) of $150,000 (50,000 items X $3 each) = total static budget of $500,000.
Unlike the static budget, a flexible budget for the shipping department will increase when more than 50,000 items for the year are shipped and it will decrease when fewer than 50,000 items are shipped. Let's assume that for the year, the department actually shipped 54,000 items. Therefore, the flexible budget for the variable expenses will ""flex"" for shipping the additional 4,000 items. The resulting flexible budget summary is:
Fixed expenses (salaries, utilities, etc.) of $350,000 + variable expenses (cartons, helpers, etc.) of $162,000 (54,000 items X $3 each) = total flexible budget of $512,000.
Flexible Budget Variance
Now let's assume that the shipping department's actual expenses for the year were:
Fixed expenses of $351,000 + variable expenses of $157,000 = total actual expenses of $508,000.
The department's total flexible budget variance is $4,000 favorable since the actual expenses of $508,000 were less than the flexible budget of $512,000.
Note that the shipping department's total static budget variance is $8,000 unfavorable since the actual expenses of $508,000 were more than the static budget of $500,000.
The $12,000 difference between the two variances result from the flexible budget being increased by $12,000 to recognize that an additional 4,000 items had to be shipped at a budgeted shipping cost of $3 per item.
Flexible Budgets Could Flex for Various Activities
The activities that could cause flexible budgets to flex might be the amount of sales, units of output, machine hours, miles traveled, etc.",what
What happens when the high-low method ends up with a negative amount?,"The high-low method of determining the fixed and variable portions of a mixed cost relies on only two sets of data: 1) the costs at the highest level of activity, and 2) the costs at the lowest level of activity. If either set of data is flawed, the calculation can result in an unreasonable, negative amount of fixed cost.
To illustrate the problem, let's assume that the total cost is $1,200 when there are 100 units of product manufactured, and $6,000 when there are 400 units of product are manufactured. The high-low method computes the variable cost rate by dividing the change in the total costs by the change in the number of units of manufactured. In other words, the $4,800 change in total costs is divided by the change in units of 300 to yield the variable cost rate of $16 per unit of product. Since the fixed costs are the total costs minus the variable costs, the fixed costs will be calculated to a negative $400. This unacceptable answer results from total costs of $1,200 at the low point minus the variable costs of $1,600 (100 units times $16), or total costs of $6,000 at the high point minus the variable costs of $6,400 (400 units times $16).
The negative amount of fixed costs is not realistic and leads me to believe that either the total costs at either the high point or at the low point are not representative. This brings to light the importance of plotting or graphing all of the points of activity and their related costs before using the high-low method. (The number of units uses the scale on the x-axis and the related total cost at each level of activity uses the scale on the y-axis.) It is possible that at the highest point of activity the costs were out of line from the normal relationship—referred to as an outlier. You may decide to use the second highest level of activity, if the related costs are more representative.
If the $6,000 of cost at the 400 units of activity is an outlier, you might select the next highest activity of 380 units having total costs of $4,000. Now the variable rate will be the change in total costs of $2,800 ($4,000 minus $1,200) divided by the change in the units manufactured of 280 (380 minus 100) for a variable rate of $10 per unit of product. Using the variable rate of $10 per unit manufactured will result in the fixed costs being a positive $200. The positive $200 of fixed costs is calculated at either 1) the low activity: total costs of $1,200 minus the variable costs of $1,000 (100 units at $10); or at 2) the high activity: total costs of $4,000 minus the variable costs of $3,800 (380 units at $10).",what
What is a transposition error?,"Definition of Transposition Error
A transposition error occurs when an amount is recorded incorrectly as the result of switching the positions of two (or more) digits. The switching of the positions causes a difference (between the recorded amount and the correct amount) that will be evenly divisible by 9.
Examples of Transposition Errors
For example, if 986 was the correct amount, but it was recorded incorrectly as 968, the difference between the two amounts is 18. Since this difference is evenly divisible by 9 (18 divided by 9 = exactly 2), the mistake is described as a transposition error. Another example of the many possible transposition errors is recording 3662 as 3626. In this situation, the difference between the correct and incorrect amounts is 36. Because the difference is evenly divisible by 9 (36 divided by 9 = exactly 4), this indicates that the error could be the result of transposing digits.
Determining Whether a Transposition Error Was Involved
If you are faced with finding a difference between two amounts, you might save some time by first dividing the difference by 9. (A few differences that are evenly divisible by 9 include: 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, etc.) Knowing that the error could be a transposition error may lead you to first review the more relevant amounts.",what
What is the coefficient of determination?,"The coefficient of determination is a statistic which indicates the percentage change in the amount of the dependent variable that is ""explained by"" the changes in the independent variables.
For example, a manufacturer may have found through simple linear regression analysis involving 15 monthly observations that 64% of the change in the total cost of electricity (the dependent variable) was associated with the change in the monthly production machine hours (the independent variable). In this example the coefficient of determination is 0.64 or 64%.
The coefficient of determination is symbolized by r-squared, where r is the coefficient of correlation. Hence, a coefficient of determination of 0.64 or 64% means that the coefficient of correlation was 0.8 or 80%. (The range for the coefficient of correlation is -1 to +1, and therefore the range for the coefficient of determination is 0 to +1.)
It is important to note that a high coefficient of determination does not guarantee that a cause-and-effect relationship exists. However, a cause-and-effect relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable will result in a high coefficient of determination.",what
What is a dependent variable?,"In accounting, a dependent variable is likely to be the total of a mixed cost that will change as the result of several factors. A factor that causes the change in the total cost is referred to as the independent variable.
To illustrate, assume that a manufacturer wants to estimate its total electricity cost for each month. The total electricity cost will be the dependent variable. Since the manufacturer's machines use large amounts of electricity, the total cost of electricity is dependent on the number of machine hours. In this example, the machine hours will be an independent variable. (It is likely that there will be many independent variables that cause the change in the amount of the dependent variable.)
The dependent variable is usually expressed as y or y' (the estimated amount of y) and the amount is referenced on a graph's y-axis. (An independent variable is expressed as x and is referenced on a graph's x-axis.) Hence the equation for the monthly electricity cost will be y = a + bx, which signifies that the total electricity cost (y) for a specific month is equal to a fixed cost (a) plus a variable cost rate (b) multiplied times the number of machine hours (x) occurring during the month.",what
What is an independent variable?,"In accounting, an independent variable is ideally a factor that causes a change in the total amount of the dependent variable. In other words, an independent variable should be something that drives a mixed cost to increase or decrease.
To illustrate, let's assume that a manufacturer's production equipment uses a significant amount of electricity. Hence, the monthly electricity cost (the dependent variable) will increase when there is an increase in the number of production machine hours (the independent variable).
In reality there are likely to be many independent variables that cause a change in the amount of the dependent variable. In the case of the monthly electricity cost, the independent variables could also include the non-production machines using electricity, the physical size of the products, the skill level of the operators, the outside temperature and humidity, etc.
Multiple regression analysis is a statistical tool that can assist in determining the significant independent variables.",what
What are gains?,"Definition of Gains
In financial accounting, gains often pertain to some of a company’s transactions which occur outside of the company’s main business activities. Transactions which are outside of a company’s main business activities are referred to as nonoperating activities. 
Gain vs Operating Income
Let's assume that a company is a retailer whose main business activities are the purchasing and reselling of merchandise. When the retailer sells $5,000 of merchandise that it had purchased at a cost of $3,000, the retailer’s income statement will report sales of merchandise of $5,000 and cost of goods sold of $3,000. The difference of $2,000 is part of the retailer's gross profit, operating income, and net income. The word ""gain"" is not appropriate since the activities involved the normal business activities of the retailer.
However, if the same retailer sells its old delivery van, this transaction is outside of the retailer’s main business activities of purchasing and selling merchandise. Therefore, the sale of the van will not be included with the sales of merchandise. Instead, a gain (or loss) will be reported as one of the company’s nonoperating items often under the heading of other income.
Calculating a Gain
To illustrate the calculation of a gain, let’s assume that the retailer sells its old van for $5,000 cash. At the time of the sale the van is on the retailer’s books at $3,500 (which consists of its original cost of $20,000 and accumulated depreciation of $16,500). Since this transaction is not a main business activity of the retailer and since the $5,000 of cash received is greater than the net cost of $3,500 being removed from the accounts, the retailer will report a nonoperating item described as gain on sale of van of $1,500. 
More Examples of Gains
Other examples of gains that could appear on a company’s income statement include:

Gain on sale of investments
Gain on sale of building
Gain on legal settlement
Gain on early extinguishment of debt",what
What is a favorable variance?,"Definition of a Variance
In accounting the term variance usually refers to the difference between an actual amount and a planned or budgeted amount. For example, if a company's budget for supplies expense is $30,000 and the actual amount is $28,000 or $34,000, there will be a variance of $2,000 or $4,000 respectively. Similarly, if a company has budgeted its revenues to be $200,000 and its actual revenues end up being $193,000 or $208,000, there will be a variance of $7,000 or $8,000 respectively.
When is a Variance Favorable
A favorable variance indicates that the variance or difference between the budgeted and actual amounts was good or favorable for the company's profits. In other words, this variance will be one reason why the amount of the company's actual profits will be better than the budgeted profits.
Favorable Expense Variance
For example, if supplies expense was budgeted to be $30,000 but the actual supplies expense ends up being $28,000, the $2,000 variance is favorable because having fewer expenses than were budgeted was good for the company's profits. It is one reason why the company's actual profits will be better than the budgeted profits.
Favorable Revenue Variance
If a company had budgeted its revenues to be $200,000 and the actual revenues end up being $208,000, the company will have a favorable variance of $8,000. The variance is favorable because having the actual revenues being more than the amount budgeted is good for the company's profits. It will also be a factor why the company's actual profits will be better than the budgeted profits.",what
How do you calculate staff turnover?,"To calculate staff turnover, I would use the W-2 wage statements for the most recent year.
My first step would be to sort the W-2's into meaningful groups such as full-time professional, full-time clerical, and part-time. (Perhaps you will sort your company's W-2's by department.)
For each group, I would count the number of W-2's for people that were no longer employed at the end of the year. Let's assume that 6 full-time professional, 3 full-time clerical, and 5 part-time employees had W-2's but they had left the company before the end of the year.
Next I would divide the counts of people who had left by the average number of filled positions in the company during that year. Let's assume that on average the number of filled positions during the year were 20 full-time professional, 6 full-time clerical, and 8 part-time.
The staff turnover for full-time professional would be 30% (the 6 people leaving during the year divided by the company's 20 positions). For the full-time clerical, the staff turnover rate is 3 divided by 6, for a rate of 50%. For the part-time employees, the staff turnover rate is 62.5% (5 leaving divided by 8 positions).
After computing the staff turnover, be sure to discuss the staff turnover rate with the company's management. Training new employees only to have an above average person leave after the training period is very expensive.",what
What is cash flow net of tax?,"I view cash flow net of tax as the amount of cash spent minus the income tax savings when the amount is deductible on the corporation's income tax return.
To illustrate this, let's assume that a U.S. corporation pays a combined federal and state income tax rate of 40% on its last increment of income. If this corporation spends an additional $10,000 for a tax deductible business expense, its taxable income will decrease by $10,000. This means that the corporation will save paying $4,000 in income taxes ($10,000 less of taxable income being taxed at 40%).
In this situation, the cash flow net of tax is $6,000 consisting of the $10,000 paid for the business expense minus the $4,000 of income taxes that will not have to be paid.",what
What is annualizing?,"Definition of Annualizing
Annualizing means taking a partial year amount and converting it to a full year amount. We will use several examples to illustrate how this works.
Examples of Annualizing

A person having a monthly salary of $4,000 is earning an annualized salary of $48,000 ($4,000 per month multiplied times 12 months in a year).
A person with a semimonthly salary of $3,000 is earning an annualized salary of $72,000 ($3,000 multiplied times 24 semimonthly pay periods).
A company having to pay an interest charge of 1.5% per month on its unpaid bills is experiencing an annualized interest rate of 18% (1.5% per month multiplied times 12 months).
A vendor's invoice having an early payment discount of ""1/10, net 30"" means that 1% can be saved if the amount owed is remitted within 10 days instead of the required 30 days. This 1% savings for paying 20 days early can be annualized by multiplying both the 1% and the 20 days by ""18"" to arrive at an annualized rate of approximately 18%.
A vendor's invoice having an early payment discount of ""2/10, net 30"" means that 2% can be saved if the amount is remitted within 10 days instead of the required 30 days. This 2% savings for paying 20 days early can be annualized by multiplying both the 2% and the 20 days by ""18"" to arrive at the annualized rate of approximately 36%. An annualized interest rate of 36% for a ""riskless investment"" of the amount owed is an amazing opportunity (as is an annualized rate of 18%). It also indicates that a company without sufficient cash to pay within the early payment discount period will experience a huge opportunity cost.",what
What is the difference between the direct method and the indirect method for the statement of cash flows?,"Main Difference between Direct and Indirect Method of SCF
The main difference between the direct method and the indirect method of presenting the statement of cash flows (SCF) involves the cash flows from operating activities. (There are no differences in the cash flows from investing activities and/or the cash flows from financing activities.)
Under the U.S. reporting rules, a corporation has the option of using either the direct or the indirect method. However, surveys indicate that nearly all large U.S. corporations use the indirect method.
Example of the Indirect Method of SCF
When the indirect method of presenting a corporation's cash flows from operating activities is used, this section of SCF will begin with a corporation's net income. The net income is then followed by the adjustments needed to convert the accrual accounting net income to the cash flows from operating activities. A few of the typical adjustments are:

Adding back depreciation expense
Adding the decrease in accounts receivable
Deducting the increase in inventory
Deducting the decrease in accounts payable
Adding the increase in accrued expenses payable

Example of the Direct Method of SCF
When the direct method of presenting a corporation's cash flows from operating activities is used, the amount of net income is not the starting point. Instead, the direct method lists the cash amounts received and paid by the corporation. Here are a few of the more common descriptions that will be seen under the direct method:

Cash from customers
Cash paid to employees
Cash paid to suppliers
Cash paid for interest

The direct method also requires a reconciliation of net income to the cash provided by operating activities. (This is done automatically under the indirect method.)",what
What is included in cash and cash equivalents?,"Examples of Cash
In accounting, a company's cash includes the following:

currency and coins
checks received from customers but not yet deposited
checking accounts
petty cash

Definition of Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments with a maturity date that was 3 months or less at the time of purchase. In other words, there is very little risk of collecting the full amount being reported.
Examples of Cash Equivalents
Examples of cash equivalents include: 

money market accounts
U.S. Treasury Bills
commercial paper

Typically, the combined amount of cash and cash equivalents will be reported on the balance sheet as the first item in the section with the heading current assets.",what
What is the purpose of the cash flow statement?,"Purpose of the Cash Flow Statement
The purpose of the cash flow statement or statement of cash flows or SCF is to identify the major cash flows occurring during the same period of time as the company's income statement and between the related balance sheets.
The major cash flows are presented in one of these classifications:

Operating activities
Investing activities
Financing activities

The net change from these three classifications also explains the major reasons for the change in the company's cash and cash equivalents between two balance sheet dates.
In addition to the cash amounts being reported as operating, investing, and financing activities, the cash flow statement is required to disclose other information, including the amount of interest paid, the amount of income taxes paid, and any significant investing and financing activities which did not require the use of cash.",what
What is depreciation expense?,"Definition of Depreciation Expense
Depreciation expense is the appropriate portion of a company's fixed asset's cost that is being used up during the accounting period shown in the heading of the company's income statement.
Example of Depreciation Expense
To illustrate depreciation expense, assume that a company had paid $480,000 for its office building (excluding land) and the building has an estimated useful life of 40 years (480 months) with no salvage value. Using the straight-line method of depreciation, the  depreciation expense to be reported on each of the company's monthly income statements is $1,000 ($480,000 divided by 480 months).
Additional Information
Depreciation expense is referred to as a noncash expense because the recurring, monthly depreciation entry (a debit to Depreciation Expense and a credit to Accumulated Depreciation) does not involve a cash payment. As a result, the statement of cash flows prepared under the indirect method will add depreciation expense to the amount of net income.
Methods for computing depreciation expense other than straight-line include double-declining balance, sum-of-the-years digits, and units of production or activity.",what
What are some examples of financing activities?,"Definition of Financing Activities
Financing activities often refers to the cash flows from financing activities, which is one of the three main sections of the statement of cash flows (or SCF or cash flow statement). In this section of the SCF, the company lists the cash inflows and cash outflows from:

Borrowing and repaying short-term loans
Borrowing and repaying long-term loans and other long-term liabilities
Issuing or reacquiring its own shares of common and preferred stock
Paying cash dividends on its capital stock

Examples of Financing Activities
When a company borrows money for the short-term or long-term, and when a corporation issues bonds or shares of its common or preferred stock and receives cash, the proceeds will be reported as positive amounts in the cash flows from financing activities section of the SCF. A positive amount informs the reader that cash was received and thereby increased the company's cash and cash equivalents.
When a company repays the principal portion of its short-term or long-term loans, redeems any of its bonds payable, purchases its owns shares of capital stock (treasury stock), or pays dividends on its capital stock, the amount of cash used will be reported as negative amounts in the cash flows from financing activities section of the SCF. The negative amount informs the reader that cash was used and thereby reduced the company's cash and cash equivalents.",what
What are some examples of investing activities?,"Definition of Investing Activities
Investing activities often refers to the cash flows from investing activities, which is one of the three main sections of the statement of cash flows (or SCF or cash flow statement). In this section of the SCF the company lists its cash inflows and cash outflows resulting from the disposal or acquisition of the company's long-term assets that took place during the time indicated in the heading of the statement.
Examples of Investing Activities
When a company makes long-term investments in securities, acquires property, equipment, vehicles, or it expands its facilities, etc., it is assumed to be using or reducing the company's cash and cash equivalents. As a result, these investments and capital expenditures are reported as negative amounts in the cash flows from investing activities section of the SCF.
When a company sells any of its long-term investments or sells any of its property, plant and equipment, it is assumed to be providing or increasing the company's cash and cash equivalents. Therefore, the cash received from the sale of these long-term assets will be reported as positive amounts in the cash flows from investing activities section of the SCF.",what
What is cash from operating activities?,"Definition of Cash from Operating Activities
Cash from operating activities usually refers to the first section of the statement of cash flows. Cash from operating activities focuses on the cash inflows and outflows from a company's main business activities of buying and selling merchandise, providing services, etc.
Basically, the cash from operating activities includes the company's cash flows except for those reported as cash flows from 1) investing activities (buying and selling property, plant and equipment, buying and selling long-term investments), and 2) financing activities (borrowing and repaying short-term and long-term debt, issuing and buying back shares of stock, paying dividends).
Examples of Reporting the Cash from Operating Activities
In the U.S., the cash from operating activities can be presented using either of the following methods:

Indirect method (almost always used)
Direct method (rarely used)

The indirect method begins with the company's net income based on the accrual method. That amount is then converted to the cash from operating activities by adding back depreciation expense and adjusting for the changes in accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, and most other current assets and current liabilities.
The direct method for reporting the cash from operating activities lists the following: the amounts collected from customers, the payments to suppliers, the payments for operating expenses, payments for interest expense, and payments for income taxes.",what
Why is Interest Expense Included in the Operating Activities Section of the Cash Flow Statement?,"Definition of Interest Expense
Interest expense is the cost of borrowing money. Under the accrual method of accounting, interest expense is reported on a company's income statement in the period in which it is incurred. Hence, interest expense is one of the subtractions from a company's revenues in calculating a company's net income.
Example of Interest Expense on the Cash Flow Statement
Since most companies use the indirect method of preparing the cash flow statement (or statement of cash flows), the company's interest expense will be contained within the company's net income, which is the first amount presented in the cash flows from operating activities.
The interest expense contained in the net income will be changed from the accrual amount to the cash amount by the change in the current liability Interest Payable. 
Since interest expense is an important amount, the statement of cash flows must disclose the amount of interest paid. This is often achieved through a supplementary disclosure.",what
Why is an increase in inventory shown as a negative amount in the statement of cash flows?,"Meaning of a Negative Amount on Statement of Cash Flows
A negative amount on the statement of cash flows (SCF) indicates that the amount described was:

A use of the company's cash
A cash outflow
Negative or unfavorable for the company's cash balance

Example Where Inventory Increased
An increase in a company's inventory indicates that the company has purchased more goods than it has sold. Since the purchase of additional inventory requires the use of cash, it means there was an additional outflow of cash. An outflow of cash has a negative or unfavorable effect on the company's cash balance. Negative effects are reported as negative amounts on the SCF.
To recap, an increase in inventory results in a negative amount being reported on the SCF. (A decrease in inventory would be reported as a positive amount, since reducing inventory has a positive effect on the company's cash balance.)
Additional Information
The change in the inventory is reported as an adjustment to the company's net income in the cash from operating activities section of the SCF prepared using the indirect method.",what
How do drawings affect the financial statements?,"Definition of Drawings
Drawings are the withdrawals of a sole proprietorship's business assets by the owner for the owner's personal use.
The drawings or draws by the owner (L. Webb) are recorded in an owner's equity account such as L. Webb, Drawings; L. Webb, Draws; or L. Webb, Withdrawals. The other part of the entry will reduce the specific business asset.
Example of Drawings
If the owner (L. Webb) draws $5,000 of cash from her business, the accounting entry will be a debit of $5,000 to the account L. Webb, Drawings and a credit of $5,000 to the account Cash.
Effect of Drawings on the Financial Statements
The owner's drawings will affect the company's balance sheet by decreasing the asset that is withdrawn and by the decrease in owner's equity.
The owner's drawings of cash will also affect the financing activities section of the statement of cash flows. (If an asset other than cash is withdrawn, it is reported as supplemental information on the statement of cash flows.)
The income statement is not affected by the owner's drawings since the drawings are not business expenses.",what
What is a noncash expense?,"Definition of a Noncash Expense
A noncash expense is an expense that is reported on the income statement of the current accounting period, but the related cash payment took place in another accounting period.
Example of a Noncash Expense
Perhaps the most common example of a noncash expense is depreciation. To illustrate, let's assume that a company purchased equipment two years ago for a cash payment of $200,000. The company determined that the equipment had a useful life of 10 years. As a result, the company's income statement will report depreciation expense of $20,000 a year for 10 years. The current year's income statement is reporting depreciation expense of $20,000 but there is no cash payment in the current year for this expense. This is why depreciation expense is referred to as a noncash expense.
This also explains why the operating activities section of the statement of cash flows usually begins with a company's net income and then immediately adds the period's depreciation expense. In effect the noncash depreciation expense is added back because the depreciation expense had reduced the company's net income reported on the income statement, but it did not use any cash during that period of time.",what
What are some examples of financing activities on the cash flow statement?,"Definition of Financing Activities
Financing activities reported on the statement of cash flows (SCF) involve changes to the long-term liabilities, stockholders' equity, and short-term borrowings during the period shown in the heading of SCF.
Examples of Financing Activities
Sources of cash provided by financing activities include:

Borrowing money on a short-term basis and/or long-term notes basis from a bank or other lenders
Issuing bonds payable
Issuing common stock
Issuing preferred stock
Sale of treasury stock
Other increases in long-term liabilities and stockholders' equity

Uses of cash reported in the financing activities section of SCF include:

Repayment of short-term loans and/or long-term loans
Retirement of bonds payable
Purchase of a company's own stock (treasury stock)
Declaration and payment of dividends
Other decreases in long-term liabilities and stockholders' equity",what
What is the difference between net cash flow and net income?,"Under the accrual method of accounting, net income is calculated as follows: revenues earned minus the expenses incurred in order to earn those revenues. If a company earns revenues in December but allows those customers to pay in 30 days, the cash from the December revenues will likely be received in January. In this situation the December revenues will increase the December net income, but will not increase the company's December net cash flow.
Under accrual accounting, expenses are matched to the accounting period when the related revenues occur or when the costs have expired. For example, a retailer may have purchased and paid for merchandise in October. However, the merchandise remained in inventory until it was sold in December. The company's net cash flow decreases in October when the company pays for the merchandise. However, net income decreases in December when the cost of the goods sold is matched with the December sales.
There are many other examples of expenses occurring in one accounting period but the payments occur in a different accounting period. In short, the statement of cash flows is a needed financial statement because the income statement does not report cash flows.",what
Where does the interest paid on bank loans get reported on the statement of cash flows.,"Definition of Interest on Bank Loans
The interest on bank loans is usually an expense of the accounting period in which the interest is incurred. Therefore, the interest appears on the income statement and reduces a company's net income. However, the interest paid also causes a change in the company's balance sheet and statement of cash flows. 
Reporting Interest Paid on the Statement of Cash Flows
In the statement of cash flows, interest paid will be reported in the section entitled cash flows from operating activities. 
Since most companies use the indirect method for the statement of cash flows, the interest expense will be ""buried"" in the corporation's net income. Net income will be the first item listed in the section cash flows from operating activities and will then be adjusted to the cash amount.
The amount of interest paid must also be disclosed. This is usually done as supplementary information at the end of the statement of cash flows or in the notes to the financial statements.",what
Where is interest on a note payable reported on the cash flow statement?,"Definition of Interest on a Note Payable
The interest on a note payable is reported on the income statement as Interest Expense. Usually this means the amount incurred (not the amount paid) under the accrual basis of accounting.
Reporting Interest on a Note Payable on the Cash Flow Statement
The interest paid on a note payable is reported in the section of the cash flow statement entitled cash flows from operating activities.
Since most corporations report the cash flows from operating activities by using the indirect method, the interest expense will be included in the company's net income or net earnings. The interest expense is adjusted to a cash amount through the changes to the working capital amounts, which are also reported as part of the cash flows from operating activities. In addition, the actual amount of interest paid must be disclosed.
If a corporation prepares its cash flow statement using the direct method, the amount of interest paid should appear as a separate line in cash flows from operating activities.
[The cash payments and cash receipts of principal  on a note payable are reported in the financing activities section of the cash flow statement.]",what
How can a company with a net loss show a positive cash flow?,"A common explanation for a company with a net loss to report a positive cash flow is depreciation expense. Depreciation expense reduces a company's net income (or increases its net loss) but it does not involve a payment of cash in the current period. For example, if a company purchased equipment last year for $2,100,000 and depreciates the equipment over seven years, its depreciation expense this year might be $300,000. This year's $300,000 entry involves a debit to Depreciation Expense and a credit to Accumulated Depreciation. Not a penny left the checking account this year. (All $2,100,000 of cash left the checking account last year.) If the company's income statement reports a loss of $50,000 after the $300,000 ""non-cash"" depreciation expense, its cash may have actually increased by $250,000.
Another explanation involves accrual accounting. A corporation must report its expenses as they are incurred and that is often before the corporation pays the invoice. For example, a corporation with an accounting year ending December 31 might have a huge expense at the end of 2012, but the invoice is not due until January 2013. The 2012 net income was reduced, but the corporation's cash is not reduced until 2013.
Here's one more example. A corporation might receive a deposit from one of its customers in December 2012, but will not earn the revenues until 2013. In that case, the corporation's cash increased in 2012, but the corporation's revenues and net income will not increase until 2013.
It is a good idea to get comfortable reading the statement of cash flows. It should be included with a corporation's income statement and balance sheet.",what
What are capital expenditures?,"Definition of Capital Expenditures
Capital expenditures are the amounts spent for tangible assets that will be used for more than one year in the operations of a business. Capital expenditures, which are sometimes referred to as capex, can be thought of as the amounts spent to acquire or improve a company's fixed assets.
The capital expenditures increase the respective asset accounts which are reported in the noncurrent asset section of the balance sheet entitled property, plant and equipment. Once the assets (except for land) are placed in service they are depreciated over their useful lives. The accumulated depreciation for these assets is also reported as part of the property, plant and equipment.
The amount of capital expenditures for an accounting period is also reported in the cash flow statement as a negative amount (since it is a cash outflow) in the investing activities section. Many financial analysts subtract the capital expenditures amount from the cash from operating activities to arrive at the company's free cash flow.
Examples of Capital Expenditures
Capital expenditures include the amounts spent to acquire or make significant improvements to land, buildings, machinery, equipment, furniture, fixtures, vehicles, computer information systems, leasehold improvements, etc.",what
Where are short-term bank loans reported on the statement of cash flows?,"Definition of Short-Term Bank Loans
Short-term bank loans are generally loans that must be repaid within one year of the date of the balance sheet. In other words, a short-term bank loan is a current liability.
Reporting Short-Term Bank Loans on the Statement of Cash Flows
The cash inflows received through short-term bank loans and the cash outflows used to repay the principal amount of short-term bank loans are reported in the financing activities section of the statement of cash flows.
The interest paid on short-term bank loans is included in the operating activities section of the statement of cash flows.",what
What are interim financial statements?,"Interim financial statements for a corporation are the financial statements covering a period of less than one year. Often interim financial statements are issued for the quarters between the annual financial statements. The purpose is to give investors and other users updated information on the corporation's operations. Unlike the annual financial statements, the interim financial statements are usually unaudited and condensed. Therefore, it is wise to also read the previously issued and complete annual financial statements and reports.
In order for the interim income statement amounts to add up to the amounts reported in the official income statement for the year, it is necessary that the accounting practices in the interim financial statements be consistent with the accounting practices that will be followed in the annual financial statements.",what
How can a company have a profit but not have cash?,"Definition of Profit
Under the accrual basis of accounting, profit is the amount of revenues earned minus the amount of expenses incurred. Note that revenues are not receipts, and expenses are not payments.
Examples of Profit Without Cash
Assume that a company uses the accrual basis of accounting. In its first month of operations, it provides $10,000 of services to its clients and allows them to pay 30 days later. It also incurs $2,000 of expenses of which it pays $1,100 immediately and will pay $900 in 30 days. In its first month, the company had a profit of $8,000 (revenues of $10,000 minus $2,000 of expenses), but its cash decreased by $1,100 (cash receipts of $0 with cash payments of $1,100). If it has no other business transactions, the company's profit in the second month will be $0 (no revenues minus no expenses) but it will have a $9,100 increase in cash (receipts of $10,000 minus payments of $900).
Now assume that a different company had a profit of $60,000 in its first year, but paid out $65,000 near the end of the year to acquire equipment that will be put into service on the first day of its second year. During its first year the company had $65,000 of profit, but may end the year with $0 cash.
Other examples where cash is paid out, but the profits are not reduced at the time of the payment, include prepayments of insurance premiums, payments to increase its inventory of merchandise, and payments to reduce liabilities.
To help recognize the difference between a company's profits and its cash flows, the statement of cash flows is one of the required external financial statements.",what
What are the required financial statements?,"The required financial statements for U.S. business corporations are:

Statement of income. This financial statement is also known as the statement of operations, statement of earnings, or income statement. It reports the corporation's revenues, expenses, gains and losses (except for items stipulated as other comprehensive income) for a period of time such as a year, quarter, 13 months, etc.
Statement of comprehensive income. This financial statement begins with the bottom line of the income statement and then lists the items considered to be other comprehensive income. Some of these items involve currency translation, hedging, and pensions.
Balance sheet. This statement of financial position reports a corporation's assets, liabilities and stockholders' equity as of the final instant of the date shown in its heading (December 31, January 31, June 30, etc.)
Statement of cash flows. This statement reports the major causes for the change in cash and cash equivalents during the accounting period. The cash flows are presented as operating, investing, or financing activities.
Statement of stockholders' equity. This financial statement is often presented as the statement of shareholders' equity, statement of equity, statement of changes in stockholders' equity, etc. It reports all of the changes in stockholders' equity which occurred during the accounting period.

The five annual financial statements must be accompanied with notes to the financial statements. These notes are needed in order to disclose additional information about items that are reported or are not reported in the financial statements.
You can see examples of the required financial statements (and the required notes) for a publicly traded U.S. corporation by searching the Internet for the corporation's name plus the words investor relations. Select Annual Reports (or select SEC filings and annual reports or 10-K).",what
What are the notes to the financial statements?,"Definition of Notes to Financial Statements
The notes to the financial statements are a required, integral part of a company's external financial statements. They are required since not all relevant financial information can be communicated through the amounts shown (or not shown) on the face of the financial statements. The notes are also referred to as footnote disclosures.
Generally, the notes are the main method for a company to comply with the full disclosure principle.
Example of Notes to Financial Statements
The first note to the financial statements is usually a summary of the company's significant accounting policies for the use of estimates, revenue recognition, inventories, property and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, fair value measurement, discontinued operations, foreign currency translation, recently issued accounting pronouncements, and others.
The remaining notes contain the details (including schedules of amounts) for items such as inventories, accrued liabilities, income taxes, employee benefit plans, leases, business segment information, fair value measurements, derivative instruments and hedging, stock options, commitments and contingencies, and more. 
Each external financial statement should also include a reference to the notes, such as: The accompanying notes are an integral part of the financial statements.",what
Is depreciation a source of funds?,"Definition of Depreciation
Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the cost of a business asset to expense over the useful life of the asset. The accounting for depreciation is a debit to Depreciation Expense and a credit to Accumulated Depreciation. As you can see, the entry does not involve the account Cash. Hence, depreciation expense is referred to as a noncash expense.
Example of Depreciation
Assume that a sidewalk florist operates a cash only business. During the most recent year, the florist had cash revenues of $100,000, cash expenses of $70,000, and depreciation expense of $8,000. Therefore, the net income reported on its income statement was $22,000. (The depreciation pertains to a truck purchased in an earlier year.)
Depreciation and the Statement of Cash Flows
The florist's statement of cash flows (using the indirect method) begins with the net income of $22,000. Next, the depreciation expense of $8,000 is shown as a positive amount and is added to the net income to arrive at $30,000, which equals the cash receipts of $100,000 minus cash expenses of $70,000.
Depreciation expense was added to the net income because the depreciation expense had reduced net income but cash was not reduced. In other words, the positive $8,000 of depreciation expense is not a source of cash, it is merely a needed adjustment to convert the accrual net income to the cash provided from the florist's operating activities. 
While the amount of depreciation expense is not a source of cash, it does reduce a corporation's taxable income. That in turn reduces a profitable corporation's cash payments for income taxes (by the amount of the corporation's income tax rate). The savings of income tax payments is equivalent to a source of cash.",what
What is the difference between the Cash Flow and Funds Flow statements?,"The cash flow statement, known formally as the Statement of Cash Flows, reports a company's change in cash and cash equivalents from one balance sheet date to another. The cash flow statement classifies the amount of the change according to operating, investing, and financing activities. The cash flow statement has been required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board since 1988, when it issued its Statement No. 95. You can read about the statement of cash flows at www.FASB.org/st.
Prior to 1988, accountants prepared a funds flow statement. Generally, the funds flow statement reported on the change in working capital from one balance sheet date to another.",what
What is the difference between gains and proceeds in terms of long-term assets?,"When long-term assets are sold, the amounts received are referred to as the proceeds.
If the amount of the proceeds is greater than the book value or carrying value of the long-term asset at the time of the sale, the difference is a gain on the sale or disposal.  If the amount received is less than the book value, the difference is a loss on the sale or disposal. Depreciation must be recorded up to the date of the disposal in order to have the asset's book value at the time of the sale.
On the statement of cash flows, the proceeds from the sale of long-term assets are reported in the investing activities section, while the gain on the sale appears in the operating activities section as a deduction from net income.",what
What is the cash flow statement?,"The cash flow statement is one of the main financial statements of a business or a nonprofit entity. (It is also known as the statement of cash flows.) The cash flow statement reports a company's major sources and uses of cash during the same period of time as the company's income statement. In other words, it lists the major reasons for the change in a company's cash and cash equivalents reported on the balance sheets at the beginning and the end of the accounting period.
The cash flow statement is needed because the income statement reports the revenues earned and the expenses incurred using the accrual method of accounting. These amounts are different from the amount of cash received and paid. Also, the company's annual income statements might report 3% of a new building's cost as depreciation expense, but the company may have paid cash for 100% of the building's cost in the year it was constructed. Since cash is critical for a company's operations and decision making, it is necessary to have the cash flow statement.
The cash flow statement is organized into four major sections: cash from operating activities, cash from investing activities, cash from financing activities, and supplemental information such as interest paid, income taxes paid, and significant noncash exchanges.",what
What is the statement of cash flows?,"The statement of cash flows is one of the main financial statements. It is to accompany the income statement, balance sheet, and statement of stockholders' equity. The statement of cash flows (also known as the cash flow statement) reports

the major sources and uses of cash during the period of the income statement
a reconciliation of the change in an organization's cash and cash equivalents (which are reported on the beginning and ending balance sheets)
supplementary information including the amount of income taxes paid, the amount of interest paid, and significant noncash investing and financing activities (such as issuing common stock in exchange for land)

The statement of cash flow is important because investors, lenders, financial analysts, and others are interested in an organization's major cash inflows and outflows. (This information is not available from the income statement because the accrual basis of accounting requires that revenues be reported when earned and expenses be reported when incurred.)
The statement of cash flows reports cash inflows as positive amounts and the cash outflows as negative amounts. They are reported in one of the three sections of the statement of cash flows: operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities.",what
What is the difference between cash flow and free cash flow?,"Definition of Cash Flow
Cash flow refers to the amounts of cash that a company, investment or project generates. The cash that a company generates is different from the company's net income (which is measured using the company's revenues and expenses under the accrual basis of accounting).
A company's significant cash flows are reported in the statement of cash flows, which is organized as follows:

Cash flows from operating activities
Cash flows from investing activities
Cash flows from financing activities
Supplemental disclosures of significant noncash changes in the above sections

Definition of Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow is a metric often used by financial analysts. It is calculated by using two amounts reported on a company's statement of cash flows:

Total/Net amount of cash flows from operating activities, minus
Capital expenditures (which is a separate item reported under cash flows from investing activities)

Example of Free Cash Flow
Assume that during the most recent year a corporation had cash flows from operating activities of $300,000 and had capital expenditures of $225,000. The corporation's free cash flow was $75,000. 
Occasionally, dividends paid to stockholders during the recent year are also deducted in calculating free cash flow.",what
"Are depreciation, depletion and amortization similar?","In accounting the terms depreciation, depletion and amortization often involve the movement of costs from the balance sheet to the income statement in a systematic and logical manner.
For example, the systematic expensing of the cost of assets such as buildings, equipment, furnishings and vehicles is known as depreciation. The systematic expensing of the cost of natural resources is referred to as depletion. The systematic expensing of other long-term costs such as bond issue costs and organization costs is referred to as amortization.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization are also described as noncash expenses, since there is no cash outlay in the years that the expense is reported on the income statement. As a result, these expenses are added back to the net income reported in the operating activities section of the statement of cash flows when it is prepared under the indirect method.
The term amortization is also used to indicate the systematic reduction in a loan balance resulting from a predetermined schedule of interest and principal payments.",what
How can a business increase its cash flow from operations?,"A business can increase its cash flow from operations (or operating activities) by looking closely at each of its current assets and current liabilities. For instance, a manufacturer should examine its inventories of materials, work-in-process, finished goods, and supplies to identify the inventory items which have not turned over in a long time. Those items may need to be scrapped so that a loss can be reported and cash will not flow for income taxes. It may also mean less cash flowing out for new materials. Reviewing the turnover of each and every item may allow the company to reduce the inventory quantities thereby freeing up cash that would have been sitting in inventory.
Accounts receivable needs to be monitored to be certain that every customer is adhering to the agreed upon credit terms and that the terms are consistent with your industry. You need to get those receivables turning to cash. Accounts payable should be reviewed to be sure that your company's cash is not being paid to suppliers prior to the required payment dates.
In addition to the in-depth review of each of the current assets and current liabilities, companies need to review its staffing in light of current levels of business and the recent advances in software and technology. Perhaps the company can function just fine with a few less salaried employees.
Lastly, the selling prices of some of a company's products, especially those that require lots of complex activities and result in many inefficiencies and headaches, may need to be increased.",what
Where can I find the amount of income taxes paid by a corporation?,"You can find the amount of income taxes paid by a corporation by reading its statement of cash flows and its notes to the financial statements.
US GAAP requires corporations to report the amount of income taxes paid. The AICPA's Accounting Trend and Techniques indicates that approximately half of the 500 large corporations that it surveyed had reported the amount of income taxes paid at the bottom of the statement of cash flows. Almost the same number had reported the amount of income taxes paid in its notes to the financial statements. Only 5 or 6 corporations had reported the amount within its statement of cash flows. For U.S. corporations whose stock is publicly-traded, you will find the statement of cash flows included in its Form 10-K, which is the annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
It is important to understand that the income tax provision reported on the income statement is not the amount of income taxes paid in that period.",what
Why does an increase in accounts payable appear as an addition on the statement of cash flows?,"Adjustments from Accrual to Cash
When the statement of cash flows (SCF, cash flow statement) is prepared using the indirect method, it begins with the company's net income for the accounting period. If the income statement was prepared using the accrual method of accounting, the  net income must be adjusted for

expenses that were not paid during the current accounting period
revenues which did not result in cash receipts in the current period

Accounts Payable Increases When Bills Are Not Paid
If the balance in a company's Accounts Payable account has increased, accountants will assume that the company did not pay for all of the expenses that were included in the current period's income statement. As a result, the company's cash balance should have increased by more than the reported amount of net income.
SCF Adjustment for an Increase in Accounts Payable
To illustrate, assume that the income statement reports $20,000 of revenues, $15,000 of expenses, and the resulting net income of $5,000. If the company's accounts payable had increased by $900, the company must not have paid for $900 of the expenses reported on the income statement. Therefore, the company's cash balance would increase by $5,900. Expressed differently, the revenues of $20,000 minus the $14,100 of cash paid for expenses ($15,000 minus the $900 of expenses not yet paid) means an increase in cash of $5,900. Hence, the positive adjustment of $900 converts the accrual accounting net income of $5,000 to be the cash amount of $5,900.
An Increase in Accounts Payable is Favorable for a Company's Cash Balance
It may help to view the positive amounts on the SCF as being favorable or good for a company's cash balance. An increase in accounts payable is a positive adjustment because not paying those bills (which were included in the expenses on the income statement) is good for a company's cash balance.",what
What is the free cash flow ratio?,"The free cash flow ratio is an amount, rather than a ratio.
The free cash flow calculation often begins with the cash flow from operating activities shown on the statement of cash flows (SCF). Next the amount of capital expenditures, taken from the investing activities section of the SCF for the same period, is deducted to arrive at the amount of free cash flow.
There are variations of the above calculation. For example, the dividends to stockholders might be viewed as a requirement and will be deducted along with the capital expenditure amount.",what
Is the direct method still used in the statement of cash flows?,"The direct method of preparing the statement of cash flows is recommended by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). However, the direct method is rarely used.
Recent editions of Accounting Trends & Techniques published by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants surveyed 500 annual reports and found that less than 10 used the direct method, while more than 490 used the indirect method.
You can read the official FASB pronouncement on the Statement of Cash Flows at www.FASB.org/st.",what
What is burn rate?,"In business, burn rate is usually the monthly amount of cash spent in the early years of a start-up business. Burn rate is an important metric since the new business must spend time and money developing a product or service before it obtains cash from revenues.
If a company has $200,000 in initial cash and its burn rate is $20,000 per month, the company will be out of cash in 10 months unless it raises additional money, begins to generate significant revenues, or reduces its burn rate. Hence, it is important that a start-up business monitor all of its expenditures and avoid payments that will not speed up or increase revenues.
The cash flow statement, formally known as the statement of cash flows, is an important financial statement that can be helpful in computing a realistic burn rate.",what
Where can I find a sample of a cash flow statement?,"A cash flow statement or statement of cash flows should be presented with a U.S. corporation's annual financial statements.
If a corporation's stock is publicly traded, the statement of cash flows will be included in its annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Form 10-K.
To assist with the preparation of a cash flow statement, we have the following forms and templates:",what
Could a company's statement of cash flows show a positive net cash flow from operating activities even though it reported a net loss on its income statement?,"Yes, a company with a net loss on its income statement could report a positive net cash flow from operating activities on its statement of cash flows.
Let's use the following amounts to illustrate this situation. A company's income statement for a recent year reported revenues of $2,000,000 and expenses of $2,075,000 for a net loss of $75,000. The expenses included depreciation expense of $100,000. A comparison of the company's balance sheets reveals that its accounts receivable decreased by $10,000 and its accounts payable increased by $7,000 during the same year. To keep our illustration simple, let's assume that except for cash, the reported amounts for the other current assets and current liabilities remained the same.
Now let's follow the indirect method of preparing the operating activities section of the statement of cash flows. We begin with the net income for the year, which was a negative $75,000. Next we add the depreciation expense of $100,000 because the depreciation expense reduced net income but did not use cash. Then we add the decrease in accounts receivable. A decrease in accounts receivable indicates that the company collected more cash than the amount of its current year's sales. Lastly, the increase in accounts payable is added. The increase in accounts payable indicates that the company paid out less cash than the amount of expenses shown on the income statement.
The total of the above amounts, (75,000) + 100,000 + 10,000 + 7,000 is a positive net cash flow from operating activities of $42,000.",what
What is Form 10-K?,"Form 10-K is a corporation's annual report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Form 10-K is required for U.S. corporations whose stock is publicly traded.
Form 10-K contains a wealth of information on the corporation in general such as its products, sales, markets, risks, officers, directors, and more. A significant portion of the Form 10-K is entitled Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. Another major section is Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. You will learn much about the corporation and about accounting by reading a corporation's entire Form 10-K. (In other words, don't skip the notes to the financial statements.)

What is a cash cow?,"A cash cow is often a profitable product or service that dominates a market and generates far more cash than is needed to maintain its market position. Companies may use the money from the cash cow to develop new products or to acquire other businesses.
The term cash cow is also used to describe a division or segment of a company that consistently generates substantial amounts of excess cash.",what
Why is an amount in the cash flows from investing activities shown in parenthesis? ,"An amount shown in parenthesis within the investing activities section of the cash flow statement indicates that cash was used to purchase a long-term asset. For example, if a company spent $350,000 to purchase property, plant and equipment, it will be reported in the cash flows from investing activities as Capital expenditures....(350,000).
The amounts appearing in parenthesis can be thought of as indicating the following:

cash flowed out
cash was reduced
cash was used
it was not good for the cash balance

Positive amounts, which are the amounts not in parenthesis, indicate:

cash flowed in
cash was increased
cash was provided
it was good for the cash balance

The amounts received from the sale of long-term assets will be shown without parenthesis. For example, if the company sells some of the equipment it had used in the business, the amount received will appear as a positive amount.",what
What is capex?,"Capex is a shortened form of the term capital expenditure or capital expenditures. Capex is often used when referring to:

 the actual amounts that were spent during a recent accounting period for additions to property, plant and equipment, and/or
 the planned amounts that will be spent for future additions to property, plant and equipment

The total capex amount that was spent in a recent accounting period is reported in the statement of cash flows within the section described as investing activities. Since the capex amount is an outflow of cash, it is reported as a negative amount.
The planned capex amounts will likely be contained in a company's internal document referred to as the capital expenditures budget (or capex budget).
Many financial analysts also subtract the capex amount from the company's cash from operating activities to arrive at the company's free cash flow.
Most of the capex items will be depreciated over the years of their useful life. This means the capex amount will likely be spread over many income statements in the form of Depreciation Expense and/or as part of a manufacturer's cost of goods sold.",what
"If a company issues stocks or bonds to pay outstanding debt, should this noncash transaction be included in the cash flow statement?","If a company issues stocks or bonds for cash and then pays off the debt, the transaction is reported in the financing section of the statement of cash flows.
If the transaction is a direct conversion of debt to equity (shares of stock) or debt to bonds and no cash receipts or cash payments occur, the transaction is to be disclosed as supplementary information.
This situation and other noncash financing and investing activities are described in Paragraph 32 of the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows, available at www.FASB.org/st.",what
What are external financial statements?,"The external financial statements of a U.S. corporation should consist of a complete set of the following:

income statement (statement of earnings, statement of operations)
statement of comprehensive income
balance sheet (statement of financial position)
statement of cash flows (cash flow statement)
statement of stockholders' equity (statement of shareholders' equity, statement of equity)
notes to the financial statements

These financial statements become ""external"" when they are distributed to people and organizations not involved in the corporation's operations. Some examples of external users are current investors and lenders, potential investors and lenders, financial analysts, certain government agencies, credit rating organizations, certain customers and suppliers, and others.
Since the external financial statements are likely to be compared to those of other corporations (and to previously issued financial statements), it is imperative that standardized rules be followed. In the U.S. these common rules are known as generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which are established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).",what
Why is the Cash Flow Statement identified as one of the financial statements?,"The Cash Flow Statement or Statement of Cash Flows is required as part of a full set of financial statements because of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows.
You can read Statement No. 95 at no cost at www.FASB.org/st.",what
What is the payout ratio?,"The payout ratio indicates the percentage of a corporation's earnings which are distributed as cash dividends to its stockholders.
Typically, the payout ratio is computed by using the per share common stock amounts. For example, if a corporation's cash dividend per share of common stock for the previous year was $0.72 and the common stock's earnings per share for that year were $1.20, the payout ratio was 60% ($0.72/$1.20).
Since dividends are formally declared by a corporation's board of directors, the corporation should have a policy regarding its payout ratio. The payout ratio policy should reflect the needs of the corporation as well as the interests of the stockholders. For instance, a startup corporation will likely have a payout ratio of 0%, since 1) the corporation will need to retain (reinvest) any profits in order to compete and grow, and 2) its stockholders want their investments to grow in value instead of receiving taxable dividends.
A large, established public utility with stable earnings and the ability to issue bonds payable (with low, tax-deductible interest payments) may strive for a payout ratio of 70%. This high payout ratio is wise for the utility, its customers, and its stockholders. This is likely to attract investors wanting a steady stream of cash dividends which increase with inflation.
To gain deeper insights for a specific corporation's payout ratio, we recommend reviewing the following components of its statement of cash flows:

cash from operating activities
cash dividends paid (part of the cash flows from financing activities)

For a U.S. corporation with stock that is publicly traded, it is wise to review the pertinent parts of its Form 10-K.",what
What is the distinction between debtor and creditor?,"Definition of Debtor
A debtor is a person or enterprise that owes money to another party. The party to whom the money is owed might be a supplier, bank, or other lender who is referred to as the creditor.
Definition of Creditor
A creditor is a person, bank, or other enterprise that has lent money or extended credit to another party. The party to whom the credit has been granted is the debtor.
Examples of a Debtor and a Creditor
Assume that a company borrows money from its bank. The company is the debtor and the bank is the creditor. If a manufacturer sells merchandise to a retailer with terms of net 30 days, the manufacturer is the creditor and retailer is the debtor.",what
What is the purpose of control accounts?,"Definition of Control Account
A control account is a general ledger account containing only summary amounts. The details for each control account will be found in a related (but separate) subsidiary ledger.
The control account keeps the general ledger free of details, but still has the correct balance for preparing the company's financial statements.
Example of Control Accounts
A common example of a control account is the general ledger account entitled Accounts Receivable. When it is used as a control account, it will contain only summary amounts, such as total credit sales for a day, total collections from customers for a day, total returns and allowances for a day, and the total amount owed by all customers.
Hence, if you want to find the amount that a specific customer still owes for its purchases on credit, it will not be shown in the control account. To find the amount that a specific customer owes, its recent payments, and its recent purchases on credit, you will quickly get that information from the Accounts Receivable Subsidiary Ledger.
Control accounts could also be used for accounts payable, equipment, and inventory.",what
What is a suspense account?,"Definition of Suspense Account
A suspense account is a general ledger account in which amounts are temporarily recorded. The suspense account is used because the appropriate general ledger account could not be determined at the time that the transaction was recorded.
As soon as possible, the amount(s) in the suspense account should be moved to the proper account(s).
Example of Using a Suspense Account
An accountant was instructed to record a significant number of journal entries written by the controller of a large company. Unfortunately, there was one amount that did not have an account designated. In order to complete the assignment by the deadline, the accountant recorded the ""mystery"" amount in the general ledger Suspense account. When the controller is available, the accountant will get clarification and will move the amount from the Suspense account to the appropriate account.",what
What is the difference between Notes Payable and Accounts Payable?,"Definition of Notes Payable
The account Notes Payable is a liability account in which a borrower's written promise to pay a lender is recorded. (The lender record's the borrower's written promise in Notes Receivable.) Generally, the written note specifies the principal amount, the date due, and the interest to be paid.
For most companies, if the note will be due within one year, the borrower will classify the note payable as a current liability. If the note is due after one year, the note payable will be reported as a long-term or noncurrent liability.
Example of a Note Payable
If a company borrows money from its bank, the bank will require the company's officers to sign a formal loan agreement before the bank provides the money. The company will record this loan in its general ledger account, Notes Payable. In addition to the formal promise, some loans require collateral to reduce the bank's risk.
Definition of Account Payable
The account Accounts Payable is normally a current liability used to record purchases on credit from a company's suppliers. In this situation there is no formal written promise to pay.
Examples of Accounts Payable
Often a company will send a purchase order to a supplier requesting goods. When the supplier delivers the goods it also issues a sales invoice stating the amount and the credit terms such as Due in 30 days. After matching the supplier's invoice with its purchase order and receiving records, the company will record the amount owed in Accounts Payable.
Other amounts recorded in Accounts Payable will include invoices/bills that a company owes for services it had received on credit. Examples include legal services, utility bills (electricity, heat, phone), consulting services, etc.",what
What is deferred revenue?,"Deferred Revenue
Deferred revenue is money received by a company in advance of having earned it. In other words, deferred revenues are not yet revenues and therefore cannot yet be reported on the income statement. As a result, the unearned amount must be deferred to the company's balance sheet where it will be reported as a liability.
The title of the general ledger liability account may have the title of Unearned Revenues, Deferred Revenues, or Customer Deposits. As the deferred amount is earned, it should be moved from Unearned Revenues to an income statement revenue account (such as Sales Revenues, Service Revenues, Fees Earned, etc).
Example of Deferred Revenue
To illustrate deferred revenue, let's assume that a company designs websites and has been asked to provide a price quote for a new website. The design company states that it can complete the new website for $70,000. The terms require a payment of $30,000 at the time the contract is signed and $40,000 at the end of the project, which is estimated to take 60 days. The company agrees to begin working on the project 10 days after the $30,000 is received.
Now let's assume that on December 27, the design company receives the $30,000 and it will begin the project on January 4. Therefore, on December 27, the design company will record a debit of $30,000 to Cash and a credit of $30,000 to Deferred Revenues. On December 31, its balance sheet will report a current liability of $30,000 with the description Deferred revenues.
As of January 31 the company has completed 2/7 of the work. Therefore, it will record an adjusting entry dated January 31 that will debit Deferred Revenues for $20,000 and will credit the income statement account Design Revenues for $20,000. Thus, the January 31 balance sheet will report Deferred revenues of $10,000 (the company's remaining obligation/liability from the $30,000 it received on December 27).",what
Why is Accumulated Depreciation an asset account?,"Definition of Accumulated Depreciation
The account Accumulated Depreciation reports the total amount of depreciation expense that has been recorded from the time the asset was put into service until the date of the balance sheet. By crediting Accumulated Depreciation (instead of crediting the asset account which has the asset's original cost), it allows for the balance sheet to report or disclose the following:

The original cost of the asset being depreciated
The amount of depreciation expense reported so far (the balance in Accumulated Depreciation)
The amount that has not yet been depreciated (the book value of the asset)

Example of Accumulated Depreciation
Let's assume that at the beginning of the current year a company's asset account Equipment reported a cost of $70,000. From the time the equipment was put into service until the beginning of the year the related Accumulated Depreciation account shows a credit balance of $45,000. During the current year the company debits Depreciation Expense for $10,000 and credits Accumulated Depreciation for $10,000. Therefore, at the end of the current year the credit balance in Accumulated Depreciation is $55,000.
By crediting the account Accumulated Depreciation instead of crediting the Equipment account, the balance sheet at the end of the year can easily report both the equipment's cost of $70,000 and its accumulated depreciation of $55,000, the net of which is $15,000. This is more informative than reporting only the net amount of $15,000 (which would likely be the case if the contra asset account Accumulated Depreciation was not used).",what
What is an account?,"Definitions of Account
In accounting, an account is a record in the general ledger that is used to sort and store transactions. For example, companies will have a Cash account in which to record every transaction that increases or decreases the company's cash. Another account, Sales, will collect all of the amounts from the sale of merchandise. Most accounting systems require that every transaction will affect two or more accounts. For example, a cash sale will increase the Cash account and will increase the Sales account.
The term account is also used in transactions where suppliers sell goods to customers and grant credit terms such as net 10 days. In those situations, a supplier is selling goods on account and the customer has purchased goods on account. The supplier has also increased the balance in its current asset account entitled Accounts Receivable and the customer will increase the balance in its current liability account entitled Accounts Payable.",what
How do I record an advance to an employee and the deduction?,"Definition of Advance to an Employee
A cash advance to an employee is usually a temporary loan by a company to an employee. In other words, the company is the lender and the employee is the borrower.
The cash advance needs to be reported as a reduction in the company's Cash account and an increase in an asset account such as Advance to Employees or Other Receivables: Advances. (If the amount is expected to be repaid within one year, this account will be reported as a current asset.)
If the cash advance is repaid through payroll withholdings, the amount withheld will be recorded as a credit to Advance to Employees.
Example of Advance to an Employee
Let's assume that a valuable employee's car requires an emergency repair of $800. The employee is unable to pay for the repair and has no other means for getting to work. The company agrees to lend the employee $800 and to withhold $100 per week from the employee's weekly payroll checks until the $800 is repaid.
The company will debit the current asset Advance to Employees for $800 and will credit Cash for $800. The weekly payroll processing will result in a credit of $100 to Advance to Employees (thereby reducing the amount that is credited to Cash).",what
What is a contra account?,"Definition of Contra Account
A contra account is a general ledger account with a balance that is opposite of the normal balance for that account classification. The use of a contra account allows a company to report the original amount and also report a reduction so that the net amount will also be reported. The net amount is often referred to as the carrying amount or perhaps the net realizable amount.
Examples of Contra Accounts
To illustrate, let's use the contra asset account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. Since it is a contra asset account, this allowance account must have a credit balance (which is contrary to the debit balances found in asset accounts). The Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is directly related to the asset account entitled Accounts Receivable. Therefore, if the Accounts Receivable has a debit balance of $40,000 and the allowance account has a credit balance of $2,000, the readers of the balance sheet will see that customers owe $40,000 for past purchases but the company does not expect to collect $2,000 of the $40,000. Therefore, the net amount of the accounts receivable that is expected to turn to cash is $38,000.
A second example of a contra asset account is Accumulated Depreciation. For instance, if a company has a plant asset such as Equipment with a debit balance of $92,000 and the account Accumulated Depreciation has a credit balance of $50,000, the carrying amount (or book value) of the equipment is $42,000.
The income statement account Sales Returns and Allowances is a contra revenue account that is associated with the revenue account Sales. If the balance in this contra account is a debit of $3,000 and the Sales account has the expected credit balance of $400,000, the company's net sales are $397,000. This use of Sales Returns and Allowances (instead of debiting Sales) enables management to see that its customers had a problem with $3,000 of the company's goods.",what
Is income tax an expense or liability?,"Definition of Income Tax
In the accounting for a regular U.S. corporation, income tax usually refers to the federal, state, local, and foreign countries' taxes that are levied based on a corporation's taxable income. The taxable income and the related income tax are found on the corporation's income tax return. (The corporation's taxable income is based on the income tax laws and regulations of the various governments.)
The accounting and financial reporting of a regular corporation's income taxes is complicated because the accounting principles are likely to be different from the income tax laws and regulations. Generally, a profitable regular corporation's financial statements will report both income tax expense and a current liability such as income taxes payable.
Examples of Income Tax Expense and Income Taxes Payable
A profitable corporation's financial statements will report:

Income tax expense on its income statement for the revenues and expenses appearing on the accounting period's income statement, and
Income taxes payable (a current liability on the balance sheet) for the amount of income taxes owed to the various governments as of the date of the balance sheet

If a corporation has overpaid its income taxes and is entitled to a refund, the amount will be reported on the balance sheet as a current asset such as Other receivables.
If there are differences between the time when certain revenues and expenses are reported on the income tax returns versus when they are reported on the financial statements, the amount of the deferred income tax will likely be reported on the balance sheet as a noncurrent liability as Deferred income taxes.",what
Is the drawing account a capital account?,"Definition of Drawing Account
A sole proprietorship will have a drawing account in which the owner's withdrawals or draws of cash or other assets are recorded. The amounts of the owner's draws are recorded with a debit to the drawing account and a credit to cash or other asset. At the end of the accounting year, the drawing account is closed by transferring the debit balance to the owner's capital account.
The Drawing Account is a Capital Account
To answer your question, the drawing account is a capital account. It's debit balance will reduce the owner's capital account balance and the owner's equity. The drawing account's purpose is to report separately the owner's draws during each accounting year. Since the capital account and owner's equity accounts are expected to have credit balances, the drawing account (having a debit balance) is considered to be a contra account. In addition, the drawing account is a temporary account since its balance is closed to the capital account at the end of each accounting year. 
Example of the Drawing Account
Let's assume that L. Ott begins a sole proprietorship with a cash investment of $3,000. The journal entry will debit Cash for $3,000 and will credit L. Ott, Capital for $3,000. Later, the L. Ott withdraws $500 from the business for her personal use. The journal entry for this transaction will debit L. Ott, Drawing for $500 and will credit Cash for $500. After this transaction, the business will have assets of $2,500 and will have owner's equity of $2,500.",what
What is Notes Payable?,"Definition of Notes Payable
In accounting, Notes Payable is a general ledger liability account in which a company records the face amounts of the promissory notes that it has issued. The balance in Notes Payable represents the amounts that remain to be paid. Since a note payable will require the issuer/borrower to pay interest, the issuing company will have interest expense. Under the accrual method of accounting, the company will also have another liability account entitled Interest Payable. In this account the company records the interest that it has incurred but has not paid as of the end of the accounting period.
For most companies the amounts in Notes Payable and Interest Payable are reported on the balance sheet as follows:

the amount due within one year of the balance sheet date will be a current liability, and
the amount not due within one year of the balance sheet date will be a noncurrent or long-term liability.

The company should also disclose pertinent information for the amounts owed on the notes. This will include the interest rates, maturity dates, collateral pledged, limitations imposed by the creditor, etc.
Examples on Notes Payable
Notes payable are required when a company borrows money from a bank or other lender. Notes payable may also be part of a transaction to acquire expensive equipment. In certain cases, a supplier will require a note payable instead of terms such as net 30 days.",what
What is the difference between a nominal account and a real account?,"Definition of Nominal Account
The balance in a nominal account is closed at the end of the accounting year. As a result, a nominal account begins each accounting year with a zero balance. Since the balance does not carry forward to the next accounting year, a nominal account is also referred to as a temporary account.
Examples of Nominal Accounts
The nominal accounts are almost always the income statement accounts such as the accounts for recording revenues, expenses, gains, and losses. When the income statement accounts are closed at the end of the accounting year, the net amount will ultimately end up in a balance sheet equity account such as the proprietor's capital account or the corporation's retained earnings account.
Definition of Real Account
The balance in a real account is not closed at the end of the accounting year. As a result, a real account begins each accounting year with its balance from the end of the previous year. Because the end-of-the-year balance is carried forward to the next accounting year, a real account is also known as a permanent account.
Examples of Real Accounts
The real accounts are the balance sheet accounts such as the accounts for recording assets, liabilities, and the owner's (or stockholders') equity. However, the sole proprietor's drawing account, which is reported on the balance sheet during the year, is a temporary account because it is closed directly to the owner's capital account at the end of the year.",what
What are balance sheet accounts?,"Definition of Balance Sheet Accounts
Balance sheet accounts are one of two types of general ledger accounts. (The other accounts in the general ledger are the income statement accounts.) 
Balance sheet accounts are used to sort and store transactions involving a company's assets, liabilities, and owner's or stockholders' equity. The balances in these accounts as of the final moment of an accounting year will be reported on the company's end-of-year balance sheet.
Balance sheet accounts are also referred to as permanent or real accounts because at the end of the accounting year the balances in these accounts are not closed. Instead, the ending balances will be carried forward to become the beginning balances in the next accounting year. (This is different from the income statement accounts which are closed at the end of each accounting year and will begin the following year with zero balances.)
Examples of Balance Sheet Accounts
Examples of a corporation's balance sheet accounts include Cash, Temporary Investments, Accounts Receivable, Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, Inventory, Investments, Land, Buildings, Equipment, Furniture and Fixtures, Accumulated Depreciation, Notes Payable, Accounts Payable, Payroll Taxes Payable, Paid-in Capital, Retained Earnings, and others.",what
"What is the difference between revenue, income, and gain?","Definition of Revenue
Revenue is the amount earned from a company's main operating activities, such as a retailer selling merchandise or a law firm providing legal services.
Definition of Gain
In accounting, a gain is the result of a peripheral activity, such as a retailer selling one of its old delivery trucks. A gain occurs when the cash amount (or its equivalent) received is greater than the asset's carrying amount, which is also referred to as the asset's book value. For example, if the company receives $3,000 for the old delivery truck, and the truck's carry amount (book value) at the time of the sale was $600, the company will have a gain of $2,400.
Definition of Income
Non-accountants might use the term income instead of the word revenue. Generally, accountants use the term income to mean ""net of revenues and expenses."" For example, a retailer's income from operations is its net sales minus the cost of goods sold minus its selling, general and administrative expenses.",what
What is a noncurrent asset?,"Definition of Noncurrent Asset
A noncurrent asset is an asset that is not  expected to turn to cash within one year of date shown on a company's balance sheet. (This assumes that the company has an operating cycle of less than one year.)
A noncurrent asset is also known as a long-term asset.
Noncurrent assets are reported under the following balance sheet headings:

Investments (long-term)
Property, plant and equipment
Intangible assets
Other assets

Examples of Noncurrent Assets
Examples of noncurrent or long-term assets include:

Cash surrender value of life insurance
Bond sinking fund
Certain investments in other corporations
Plant assets such as land, buildings, equipment, furnishings, vehicles, leasehold improvements
Intangible assets such as goodwill, trademarks, mailing lists",what
"What is reported as property, plant and equipment?","Definition of Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment is the long-term asset or noncurrent asset section of the balance sheet that reports the tangible, long-lived assets that are used in the company's operations. These assets are commonly referred to as the company's fixed assets or plant assets.
Generally, the property, plant and equipment assets are reported at their cost followed by a deduction for the accumulated depreciation that applies to all of these assets except land (which is not depreciated).
Examples of Property, Plant and Equipment
Typical assets that are included in property, plant and equipment are land, buildings, machinery, equipment, vehicles, furniture, fixtures, office equipment, etc. which are used in the business. Also included in this balance sheet classification is a subtraction of the accumulated depreciation that pertains to these assets.",what
What type of account is the Dividends account?,"Definition of Dividends Account
The account Dividends (or Cash Dividends Declared) is a temporary, stockholders' equity account that is debited for the amount of the dividends that a corporation declares on its capital stock. At the end of the accounting year, the balance in the Dividends account is closed by transferring the account balance to Retained Earnings. (Corporations could debit Retained Earnings directly when dividends are declared. In that case the Dividends account is not used.) 
Example of Using the Dividends Account
When a corporation declares a cash dividend on its common stock, it will credit a current liability account Dividends Payable and will debit either:

Retained Earnings, or
Dividends

Dividends is a balance sheet account. However, it is a temporary account because its debit balance will be closed to the Retained Earnings account at the end of the accounting year.",what
What is a real account?,"Definition of a Real Account
A real account is a general ledger account that does not close at the end of the accounting year. In other words, the balances in the real accounts are carried over to become the beginning balances of the next accounting period. Real accounts are also referred to as permanent accounts.
Examples of Real Accounts
The real accounts are the balance sheet accounts which include the following:

Asset accounts (cash, accounts receivable, buildings, etc.)
Liability accounts (notes payable, accounts payable, wages payable, etc.)
Stockholders' equity accounts (common stock, retained earnings, etc.)",what
How is the account Cash Short and Over used?,"Definition of Cash Short and Over Account
The account Cash Short and Over is an income statement account (within a company's general ledger) in which shortages or overages of cash are recorded. The Cash Short and Over account might be used by:

A bank to record daily differences (if any) between a teller's actual cash at the end of the day versus the expected amount of cash based on checks cashed, deposits received, etc.
A company to record unexplained differences arising when a company's petty cash fund is replenished

The account Cash Short and Over provides a way to monitor employees' cash handling proficiency.
Generally, the amounts in the account Cash Short and Over are so small that the account balance will be included with other insignificant amounts reported on the income statement as Other Expenses.
Example of How the Account Cash Short and Over is Used
Let's illustrate the Cash Short and Over account with the petty cash fund. Assume that the company has a petty cash fund of $100 and its general ledger account Petty Cash reports an imprest balance of $100. Let's now assume that when the petty cash fund is replenished, there is $6.00 on hand and there are $93.00 of petty cash vouchers. This indicates a shortage of $1.00.
Using the above information, the journal entry to replenish the petty cash fund will include a credit of $94.00 to the account Cash: Checking Account. (This is the amount of the company check that will be cashed to get the cash in the petty cash fund back to the imprest general ledger amount of $100.) The debits will be the accounts and amounts shown on the petty cash receipts, which total $93. To get the journal entry to balance, a debit of $1 is recorded in Cash Short and Over.",what
What is a temporary account?,"Definition of Temporary Account
A temporary account is a general ledger account that begins each accounting year with a zero balance. Then at the end of the year its account balance is removed by transferring the amount to another account. This is done through closing entries. Temporary accounts are also referred to as nominal accounts.
All of the income statement accounts are classified as temporary accounts. A few other accounts such as the owner's drawing account and the income summary account are also temporary accounts. 
Examples of Temporary Accounts
Temporary accounts include all of the various groups of income statement accounts:

Revenues
Expenses
Gains
Losses

Having temporary income statement accounts makes for easy reporting of each year's details. After the amounts for the year have been reported on the income statement, the balances in the temporary accounts will end up in a permanent account such as a corporation's retained earnings account or in a sole proprietor's capital account. (In a manual system, the balances in the income statement accounts will first be closed to an income summary account. Next, the income summary balance will be transferred to the corporation's retained earnings or to the sole proprietor's capital account.)
A temporary account that is not an income statement account is the proprietor's drawing account. The balance in the drawing account is transferred directly to the owner's capital account and will not be reported on the income statement or in an income summary account.",what
What are income statement accounts?,"Definition of Income Statement Accounts
Income statement accounts are one of two types of general ledger accounts. (The other accounts in the general ledger are the balance sheet accounts.)
Income statement accounts are used to sort and store transactions involving:

Operating revenues
Operating expenses
Non-operating revenues and gains
Non-operating expenses and losses

Large companies may have thousands of income statement accounts in order to budget and report revenues and expenses by divisions, product lines, departments, and so on. 
Income statement accounts are also referred to as temporary accounts or nominal accounts because at the end of each accounting year their balances will be closed. This means that the balances in the income statement accounts will be combined and the net amount transferred to a balance sheet equity account. In the case of a corporation, the equity account is Retained Earnings. In the case of a sole proprietorship, the equity account is the owner's capital account. As a result, the income statement accounts will begin the next accounting year with zero balances.
Examples of Income Statement Accounts
A few of the many income statement accounts used in a business include Sales, Sales Returns and Allowances, Service Revenues, Cost of Goods Sold, Salaries Expense, Wages Expense, Fringe Benefits Expense, Rent Expense, Utilities Expense, Advertising Expense, Automobile Expense, Depreciation Expense, Interest Expense, Gain on Disposal of Truck, and many more.",what
What is a cash discount?,"Definition of Cash Discount
A cash discount is a deduction allowed by some sellers of goods or by some providers of services in order to motivate customers to pay within a specified time. The cash discount is also referred to as an early payment discount.
The sellers and providers offering a cash discount will refer to it as a sales discount, while the buyer will refer to the same discount as a purchase discount.
Examples of a Cash Discount
Let's assume that a company offers a cash discount and it is printed on its sales invoices as 1/10, net 30. Let's also assume that a sales invoice is for $1,000 and the buyer has been authorized to return $100 of goods. Therefore, the net amount due to the seller within 30 days is $900. However, the buyer may deduct $9 (1% of $900) if the buyer pays the seller $891 within 10 days of the invoice date. The seller will usually record the $9 cash discount with a debit to the account Sales Discounts. The buyer will record the $9 savings as a credit to Purchase Discounts or as a reduction to the cost recorded in inventory.
My dentist offers a 5% cash discount if the dental fee is paid on the day of the service. This discount is offered to avoid the expenses of billing, mailing statements for unpaid amounts, processing partial payments, not collecting amounts owed, etc. The dentist and others accept credit card payments and pay a fee to a credit card processor in order to avoid similar expenses.",what
What is responsibility accounting?,"Definition of Responsibility Accounting
Responsibility accounting involves the internal accounting and budgeting for each responsibility center within a company. The objective of responsibility accounting is to assist in the planning and control of a company's responsibility centers.
Example of Responsibility Accounting
Typically each decentralized department and division within a company will receive a monthly report showing its budgeted and actual amounts for the most recent month as well as the year-to-date budgeted and actual amounts.",what
What is the difference between receivables and accounts receivable?,"Definition of Accounts Receivables
Accounts receivable are usually current assets that result from selling goods or providing services to customers on credit. Accounts receivable are also known as trade receivables.
Definition of Receivables
The term receivables sometimes refers to a company's accounts receivables. However, the term receivables could include both trade receivables and nontrade receivables.
Nontrade receivables exclude accounts receivable and may appear on the balance sheet as other receivables.
Examples of Nontrade Receivables
Some examples of nontrade or other receivables include:

Interest receivable
Income tax receivable
Insurance claims receivable
Receivables from employees",what
What is meant by owner's draws?,"Definition of Owner's Draws
Owner's draws are withdrawals of a sole proprietorship's cash or other assets made by the owner for the owner's personal use. The account in which the draws are recorded is a contra owner's capital account or contra owner's equity account since its debit balance is contrary to the normal credit balance of the owner's equity or capital account.
The title of the account for recording R. Smith's draws from his or her business is R. Smith, Drawing or R. Smith, Withdrawals. This account is a temporary account because its balance will be closed at the end of each year. However, the account's debit balance is closed directly to the owner's capital account. (The owner's draws are not reported as an expense on the company's income statement.) 
Example of Owner's Draws
Let's assume that R. Smith, the owner of a sole proprietorship, withdraws $2,000 each month for the owner's household expenses. The company's entry to record each month's draws will be:

A debit to R. Smith, Drawing (an owner's equity account with a debit balance)
A credit to Cash",what
What is the difference between a deferred expense and a prepaid expense?,"Definition of Deferred Expense and Prepaid Expense
Deferred expense and prepaid expense both refer to a payment that was made, but due to the matching principle, the amount will not become an expense until one or more future accounting periods. Most of these payments will be recorded as assets until the appropriate future period or periods. Sometimes these amounts are referred to as prepayments.
Before a balance sheet is prepared, the accountant must review the deferrals/prepaids and move the appropriate amounts to expense.
Difference between Deferred Expense and Prepaid Expense
It appears that most accountants refer to the deferrals that will become expenses within one year of the balance sheet as prepaid expenses. The amount that has not been expensed as of the balance sheet date will be reported as a current asset.
The deferred expenses that will not become expenses within one year of the date of the balance sheet will be reported in the long-term asset section of the balance sheet under the classification of other assets. (An exception is the costs of issuing long-term bonds. This amount is reported on the balance sheet as a contra liability account along with Bonds Payable in the long-term liability section.)",what
What is a purchase return?,"Definition of Purchase Return
A purchase return occurs when a buyer returns merchandise that it had purchased from a supplier. Since the return of purchased merchandise is time consuming and costly, under the periodic inventory system there will be an account Purchases Returns. This allows the company's management to see the magnitude of the returns that occurred.
The account Purchases Returns is a general ledger account that will have a credit balance (or no balance). Its credit balance will offset the debit balance in the Purchases account. 
Example of a Purchase Return
Let's assume that a company using the periodic inventory system, purchased merchandise having a cost of $1,000 with terms of net 30 days. This was recorded with:

A debit to Purchases for $1,000
A credit to Accounts Payable for $1,000

A few days later, the company discovered that some of the merchandise it received was of a lower quality. The company notified the supplier and was instructed to return the merchandise. Assuming this merchandise had a cost of $200, the company recorded the purchases return as follows:

A debit to Accounts Payable for $200
A credit to Purchases Returns $200

The debit of $1,000 in the Purchases account and the credit of $200 in the Purchases Returns will mean that for this transaction the company had net purchases of $800.",what
What is a long-term asset?,"Definition of Long-term Asset
A long-term asset is an asset that is not expected to be converted to cash or be consumed within one year of the date shown in the heading of the balance sheet. (If a company has an operating cycle that is longer than one year, a long-term asset is not expected to turn to cash within the operating cycle.) Expressed another way, a long-term asset is an asset that does not meet the criteria of being reported as a current asset. Hence, long-term assets are also known as noncurrent assets or long-lived assets. 
Examples of Long-term Assets
Long-term assets include the following:

Long-term investments. These include some investments in stocks and bonds of other corporations, a company's bond sinking fund, the cash surrender value of life insurance policies owned by the company, real estate awaiting to be sold, etc.
Property, plant and equipment. This classification includes land, buildings, machinery, equipment, vehicles, fixtures, etc. that are used in the business. These assets are reported at cost and the contra asset accumulated depreciation is also included.
Intangible assets. These include trademarks, patents, customer lists, goodwill, etc. that were acquired in a transaction.
Deferred charges. This category is used for items that do not fit into the other long-term asset classifications.",what
What are the typical items reported as current liabilities?,"Here are the typical items that are reported as current liabilities on a corporation's balance sheet:
1. Accounts payable. These are the amounts that are due to vendors who have supplied goods or services. The accounts payable are supported by the vendor invoices that have been approved and processed, but have not yet been paid.
2. Deferred revenues. This reports the amounts that a customer has prepaid and will be earned by the company within one year of the balance sheet date. An example is a retailer's unredeemed gift cards.
3. Accrued compensation. Included in this are payroll related items such as the amounts due to employees and the amounts to be remitted for payroll taxes.
4. Other accrued expenses or liabilities. This reports the amounts that the company owes for items not recorded in accounts payable or accrued compensation. Examples include the interest expense that the company has incurred (but has not yet paid) and repairs that took place but the vendor's invoice has not been fully processed.
5. Accrued income taxes and perhaps some deferred income taxes.
6. Short-term notes. These include the loans from banks that will become due within one year of the balance sheet date.
7. The current portion of long-term debt. The principal payments of a mortgage loan or an equipment loan that must be paid within one year of the date of the balance sheet are reported in this item.
To be reported as a current liability the item must be due within one year of the balance sheet date (unless the company's operating cycle is longer). However, there is no requirement that the current liabilities be presented in the order in which they will be paid. Hence, the current portion of long-term debt might be listed last, but the principal payment might be due within several days of the balance sheet date.",what
What is a reclassification?,"Definition of Reclassification
In accounting, the term reclassification is often used to describe moving an amount from one general ledger account to another. 
Examples of Reclassification
Assume that a repair bill of $5,000 was initially debited to the asset account Equipment. Since the repair was not an improvement nor did it extend the life of the equipment, the controller prepared a journal entry that debits Repairs Expense for $5,000 and credits Equipment for $5,000. The description on the controller's journal entry was, ""To reclassify the XYZ Co.'s repair bill from Equipment to Repairs Expense.""
Reclassification can also be used to describe moving a note payable from a long-term liability account to a short-term or current liability account when the note's maturity date is less than one year away.
Another example of reclassification arises when a company stops using one of its buildings and puts the building up for sale. In that situation, the journal entry description might be, ""To reclassify the X building from property, plant and equipment to long-term investments.""",what
Where do credit card payments get recorded?,"Definition of Credit Card Payments
We define a credit card payment as the amount a company remits to the credit card company for the purchases that occurred by using the credit card.
The company's payment to the credit card company will result in a credit to the company's Cash account. However, the debit portion of the payment entry depends on whether the individual credit card purchases had been previously recorded in the company's general ledger accounts.
Example of Recording Credit Card Payments
Assuming that the credit card purchases had not been previously entered into the accounts, there will be many debits in order to record each of the many credit card purchases/transactions into the company's appropriate general ledger account(s).
Assuming that the credit card purchases were recorded in the general ledger accounts prior to the company paying the credit card bill, the payment to the credit card company might be recorded with a credit to Cash and a single debit to Credit Card Payable (if that account was used when recording the credit card purchases).",what
What is a purchase discount?,"Definition of Purchase Discount
A purchase discount is a deduction that a company may receive if the supplier offers it and the company pays the supplier's invoice within a specified period of time. The purchase discount is also known as a cash discount or early-payment discount. (A supplier offering the discount will record the discounts taken by its customers in the account Sales Discounts.)
Purchase Discounts is also a general ledger account used by a company purchasing inventory goods and accounting for them under the periodic inventory system.
Example of Purchase Discount
Assume that a company receives a supplier's invoice of $5,000 with the credit terms 2/10 net 30. The company will be allowed to subtract a purchase discount of $100 (2% of $5,000) and remit $4,900 if the invoice is paid in 10 days. Otherwise, the company must pay the full $5,000 within 30 days.
If a company purchases office equipment for $20,000 and the invoice has credit terms of 1/10, net 30, the company can deduct $200 (1% of $20,000) and remit $19,800 if the invoice is paid within 10 days. If that occurs, the company will record the equipment at its cost of $19,800.",what
What is the entry for a loan to an employee?,"Definition of Loan to Employee
A loan to an employee is money advanced by the company to assist the employee. If the employee is expected to repay the loan within one year of the balance sheet date, the loan balance is a current asset of the company. Any amount not expected to be collected within one year is a noncurrent or long term asset.
It is common for the loan to an employee to specify an interest rate and a schedule of payments.
Entry to Record a Loan to Employee
Assume that a company lends an employee $5,000 for a family emergency. The entry will debit Loan to Employee for $5,000 and will credit Cash for $5,000.
Under the accrual method of accounting, at each balance sheet date the company should record any accrued interest by debiting Interest Receivable and crediting Interest Income.
When the employee makes a payment, the company will debit Cash and will credit Interest Receivable and Loan to Employee for the appropriate amounts.",what
Are the goods purchased by a retailer an expense or an asset?,"Definition of Goods Purchased by a Retailer
The goods purchased by a retailer are the products or merchandise that it buys and plans to resell.
The goods that are sold during the accounting period must be reported on the retailer's income statement as the cost of goods sold. 
The goods that are unsold at the end of the accounting period must be reported on the retailer's balance sheet as inventory.
Accounting for the Goods Purchased
There are two ways to record the goods at the time the goods are purchased:

Their cost could be recorded in an expense account (such as Cost of Goods Sold)
Their cost could be recorded in an asset account (such as Inventory)

Either way, the Inventory account must be adjusted to the actual amount. The other part of the adjusting entry is recorded in the income statement account.
Examples of Accounting for Goods Purchased
Assume that a retailer begins the year with inventory having a cost of $800. It ends the year with inventory having a cost of $900. During the year the retailer purchased goods at a cost of $7,000. Let's also assume that the cost per unit did not change during the year.
If the retailer records the $7,000 of purchases as an expense (cost of goods sold), then at the end of the year the retailer's adjusting entry must debit Inventory for $100 (since the inventory has increased from $800 to $900). The other account in this adjusting entry is the expense Cost of Goods Sold which is credited for $100. As a result, the income statement will report the cost of goods sold at $6,900 ($7,000 minus the $100 credit). The balance sheet will report inventory of $900 ($800 plus the debit of $100).
If the retailer records the $7,000 of purchases as an asset, the Inventory account balance increases from $800 to $7,800. Since the actual inventory at the end of the year is $900, the adjusting entry must credit Inventory for $6,900 ($7,800 minus $900) and debit Cost of Goods Sold for $6,900.
Regardless of whether the goods purchased were initially recorded as an expense or as an asset, the amounts must be adjusted so that the financial statements report the expense (reported as the cost of goods sold on the income statement for the year) at $6,900 and the asset inventory (reported on the balance sheet as of the end of the year) at $900.",what
What is the difference between par and no par value stock?,"Some states' laws require or may have required common stock issued by corporations residing in their states to have a par value. The par value on common stock has generally been a very small amount per share. Other states might not require corporations to issue stock with a par value. So the par value on common stock is a legal consideration.
From an accounting standpoint, the par value of an issued share of common stock must be recorded in an account separate from the amount received over and above the amount of par value. For example, if a corporation issues 100 new shares of its common stock for a total of $2,000 and the stock's par value is $1 per share, the accounting entry is a debit to Cash for $2,000 and a credit to Common Stock—Par $100, and a credit to Paid-in Capital in Excess of Par for $1,900. In total the Cash account increased by $2,000 and the paid-in capital reported under stockholders' equity increased by a total of $2,000 ($100 + $1,900).
If a corporation is not required to have a par value or a stated value and the corporation issues 100 shares for $2,000, then the accounting entry will be a debit to Cash for $2,000 and a credit to Common Stock for $2,000.
In other words, when the issued stock has a par value, the proceeds from the issuance gets divided between two of the paid-in capital accounts within stockholders' equity. If the issued stock does not have a par value, the proceeds from the issuance goes into just one paid-in capital account within stockholders' equity.",what
What is a classified balance sheet?,"A classified balance sheet is one that arranges the balance sheet accounts into a format that is useful for the readers. For example, most balance sheets use the following asset classifications:

current
long-term investments
property, plant and equipment
intangible assets
other assets

Liabilities are usually classified as:

current, or
noncurrent or long-term liabilities",what
What are the two methods for recording prepaid expenses?,"Definition of Prepaid Expenses
Prepaid expenses refers to payments made in advance and part of the amount will become an expense in a future accounting period. A common example is paying a 6-month insurance premium in December that provides coverage from December 1 through May 31. 
Examples of Two Methods for Recording Prepaid Expenses
One method for recording a prepaid expense is to record the entire payment in an asset account. For example, assume that on December 1 a company pays an insurance premium of $2,400 for 6 months of liability insurance coverage:

On December 1 the company debits Prepaid Insurance for $2,400 and credits Cash for $2,400
On the last day of December and on the last day of the following 5 months the company needs to record an adjusting entry that debits Insurance Expense for $400 ($2,400 divided by 6 months) and credits Prepaid Insurance for $400

A second method of recording a prepaid expense is to record the entire payment in the expense account. Using the information above, the following entries will occur:

On December 1 the company debits Insurance Expense for $2,400 and credits Cash for $2,400
On the last day of December the company records an adjusting entry that debits the asset account Prepaid Insurance for $2,000 ($2,400 divided by 6 months times the 5 months that will be prepaid as of December 31) and credits Insurance Expense for $2,000
At the end of each of the following 5 months the adjusting entry will debit Insurance Expense for $400 and will credit Prepaid Insurance for $400

Either method for recording prepaid expenses could be used as long as the asset account balance is equal to the unexpired or unused cost as of each balance sheet date.",what
Is there a difference between the accounts Purchases and Inventory?,"Purchases Account Under the Periodic Inventory System
The general ledger account Purchases is used to record the purchases of inventory items under the periodic inventory system. Under the periodic system the account Inventory will have no entries until it is adjusted at the end of the accounting year so that it reports the cost of the ending inventory.
Under the periodic system, the cost in the account Purchases will be added to the cost of the beginning inventory to arrive at the cost of goods available. The cost of the ending inventory is computed through a physical count (or an estimate) and is subtracted from the cost of goods available to arrive at the cost of goods sold.
Inventory Account Under the Perpetual Inventory System
The account Purchases is nonexistent with the perpetual inventory system. Under the perpetual inventory system, the cost of inventory items purchased are recorded directly into the account Inventory.
Under the perpetual system, the costs of the goods sold are removed from the account Inventory when the goods are sold and are recorded in the account Cost of Goods Sold. As a result, the balance in the account Inventory should be the cost of the ending inventory.",what
What is the accounting entry to close the sole proprietorship drawing account?,"Definition of Sole Proprietorship Drawing Account
The drawing or withdrawal account for a sole proprietorship is a temporary owner equity's account that is closed at the end of the accounting year. The drawing account is also a contra account to owner's equity, because the drawing account's debit balance is contrary to the normal credit balance for an owner's equity account.
At the end of the accounting year, the drawing account is closed directly to the capital account with an entry that debits the owner's capital account and credits the owner's drawing account. Please note that the owner's drawing account is not an expense and as a result it does not get closed to the Income Summary account nor will the amount appear on the company's income statement.
Example of the Entry to Close the Drawing Account
Let's assume that at the end of the accounting year the account Eve Jones, Drawing has a debit balance of $24,000. This balance is the result of Eve withdrawing $2,000 per month from her sole proprietorship for her personal use. (The monthly withdrawals were recorded with a debit to Eve Jones, Drawing and a credit to Cash.) The journal entry to close the drawing account at the end of the accounting year will credit Eve Jones, Drawing for $24,000 and will debit Eve Jones, Capital for $24,000.",what
What is a/c?,"Definition of a/c
In accounting, a/c is the abbreviation for account.
Example of a/c
An accountant might leave the following note for a subordinate:
""Please review the balance in the a/c Interest Payable.""",what
What is stock?,"In accounting there are two common uses of the term stock. One meaning of stock refers to the goods on hand which is to be sold to customers. In that situation, stock means inventory.
The term stock is also used to mean the ownership shares of a corporation. For example, an owner of a corporation will have a stock certificate which provides evidence of his or her ownership of a corporation's common stock or preferred stock. The owner of the corporation's common or preferred stock is known as a stockholder.",what
In what order are liabilities listed in the chart of accounts?,"Order for Listing Liabilities
It is logical for a company's liabilities to be organized in the chart of accounts in the same way as they are presented on the balance sheet:

Current liabilities
Noncurrent or long-term liabilities

Order for Listing Current Liabilities
Within the current liabilities classification, the order in which the current liability accounts are listed can vary. Here is a summary of how they might be organized:

Short-term notes payable
Current portions of long-term debt
Accounts payable
Payroll related liabilities
Other accrued expenses
Income taxes payable

Again, the order will vary. For example, some companies will list Accounts Payable as the first current liability account.",what
What is the difference between the accounts rent receivable and rent revenue?,"Definition of Rent Receivable
Rent Receivable is the title of the balance sheet asset account which indicates the amount of rent that has been earned, but has not been collected as of the date of the balance sheet.
Definition of Rent Revenue
Rent Revenue is the title of an income statement account which (under the accrual basis of accounting) indicates the amount of rent that has been earned during the period of time indicated in the heading of the income statement.
The account Rent Revenue is also known as Rental Income.",what
Will every transaction affect an income statement account and a balance sheet account?,"No. Some transactions affect only balance sheet accounts. For example, when a company pays a supplier for goods previously purchased with terms of net 30 days, the payment will be recorded as a debit to the liability account  Accounts Payable  and as a credit to the asset account Cash. (No revenue account or expense account is involved.)
Another example of a transaction affecting two balance sheet accounts and no income statement account is a deposit for future services. The payer will debit the asset Prepaid Expenses and will credit the asset Cash. The company receiving the payment will debit Cash and will credit a liability account such as Customer Deposits, Unearned Revenues or Deferred Revenues.
Adjusting entries are a classification of accounting entries that will affect a balance sheet account and an income statement account.",what
What is a purchase allowance?,"A purchase allowance is a reduction in the buyer's cost of merchandise that it had purchased. The purchase allowance is granted by the supplier because of a problem such as shipping the wrong items, the incorrect quantity, flaws in the goods, etc. In the case of a purchase allowance, the buyer does not return the merchandise to the supplier.
Under a periodic inventory system, the buyer will record the purchase allowance with 1) a credit to the account Purchase Allowances or to the account Purchase Returns and Allowances, and 2) a debit to Accounts Payable. (The supplier will record the allowance with a debit to Sales Allowances and a credit to Accounts Receivable.)
The buyer will offset the debit balance in its Purchases account with the credit balance in Purchase Allowances as part of its computation of net purchases.",what
How is petty cash reported on the financial statements?,"Definition of Petty Cash
Petty Cash is a small amount of money that a company has available to pay small amounts without writing a company check. The money might be used to pay the mail carrier for postage due on an envelope being received, reimbursing an employee for a company errand, etc.
Reporting Petty Cash on the Financial Statements
The petty cash amount may appear as the first or second item listed in the current asset section of the balance sheet.  However, the petty cash amount might be combined with the balances in the other cash accounts and their total reported as Cash or as Cash and cash equivalents as the first current asset.",what
What is a contra expense account?,"A contra expense account is a general ledger expense account that is expected to have a credit balance instead of the usual debit balance. In other words, the account's credit balance is contrary to (or opposite of) the usual debit balance for an expense account.
Another description of a contra expense account is an account that reduces or offsets the amounts reported in one or more of the other general ledger expense accounts.
One use of a contra expense account is to record the amounts of expenses that were reimbursed by its employees. For example, Company M might debit its expense account 4210 Employee Health Insurance Expense when recording the insurance company invoice of $10,000. If Company M required its employees to reimburse it for $2,000, Company M could credit its contra expense account 4211 Portion of 4210 Reimb by Employees. The benefit of using the contra expense account is that the company's managers can look in account 4210 to immediately see the company's total cost of the health insurance. They can also easily see in account 4211 the amount that the employees paid. The income statement could simply report the net amount of the expense, which is $8,000 ($10,000 minus $2,000).",what
What is a valuation account?,"In accounting, a valuation account is usually a balance sheet account that is used in combination with another balance sheet account in order to report the carrying amount of an asset or liability.
An example of a valuation account that is associated with an asset is the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. This account's credit balance will be combined with the debit balance in Accounts Receivable in order to report the carrying amount of the company's accounts receivable. Other valuation accounts include Discount on Notes Receivable, Accumulated Depreciation, and allowance accounts used with inventory and investments.
Two examples of a valuation account associated with a liability are Bond Issue Costs and Discount on Bonds Payable. The debit balances in these valuation accounts will be combined with the credit balance in Bonds Payable in order to report the carrying amount of the bonds. Premium on Bonds Payable is a valuation account with a credit balance.",what
What are gross sales?,"Gross sales are the amounts a company earned and recorded from the sales of its products (and perhaps its services). The amounts originate from the company's sales invoices but the total will be adjusted to the accrual basis at the end of each accounting period.
The gross sales amounts from the sales invoices are recorded in a general ledger account such as Sales. (Any sales returns, sales allowances, and sales discounts should be recorded in separate contra revenue accounts in order for management to see the magnitude of these items.)
Gross sales is also defined as the sales revenues before deducting the sales returns, sales allowances, and sales discounts. (Gross sales minus sales returns, sales allowances, and sales discounts is the definition of net sales.)
A review of the income statement for 19 publicly-traded corporations revealed that only the net amount of sales (or revenues) appeared on the face of the income statements.",what
What does it mean to reclassify an amount?,"To reclassify an amount often means to move an amount from one general ledger account to another general ledger account.
To illustrate, let's assume that an invoice for $900 was recorded in the account Advertising Expenses. Upon review, the advertising manager informs the accountant that the amount should have been recorded in the account Marketing Supplies. If the accountant uses a journal entry to move the amount, the entry's description might be: To reclassify $900 from Advertising Expense to Marketing Supplies.
In this illustration, the phrase to reclassify an amount has a gentler tone than the phrase to correct an account coding error.",what
What is a sole proprietorship?,"A sole proprietorship is a form of business organization that is owned by one person. The owner is referred to as a sole proprietor.
In accounting, the balance sheet of the sole proprietorship reflects the accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity. Owner's Equity consists of the owner's capital account and also a drawing account. The drawing account is a temporary account in which the owner's current year draws or withdrawals are recorded. (The sole proprietor has draws because he or she does not receive a salary or wages. Hence, the income statement will not report an expense for the owner's work. This means that the net income reflects the total return for the owner's work and investment.)
A sole proprietorship is not legally separate from its owner (as would be the case with a corporation). However, a sole proprietor may be able to register as a limited liability company in order to limit his or her personal liability. Be sure to seek professional advice as to the appropriate form of business for your situation and location.",what
How do I start a petty cash fund?,"To start a petty cash fund you need to open a general ledger account entitled Petty Cash. This will be an additional cash account that you could report either separately or have its balance included with other cash accounts when preparing a balance sheet.
Next you need to write a check for the amount that you believe is the amount needed for making small payments in your office. Let's assume that the amount will be $100. When processing the check you would indicate the account code for Petty Cash, so that the new account will be debited for $100.
You also need to designate one person to be the petty cash custodian. This person's name will be the payee of the $100 check. This person will then be accountable for the $100. At all times the custodian must have a combination of cash and petty cash receipts which add up to $100.
Just prior to issuing financial statements, the petty cash custodian should request cash for the petty cash receipts. This is known as replenishing the petty cash fund. This allows for the expenses to be included in the income statement and will result in the custodian having the $100 of cash that will be reported in the balance sheet. The custodian can also replenish the petty cash fund when there is little cash on hand due to a large amount of petty cash payments.",what
How do you record a deposit on utilities?,"A deposit on utilities is recorded with a debit to the asset account Utilities Deposit and a credit to the asset account Cash. The account Utilities Deposit will be reported as a current asset if the company expects the amount to be returned by the utilities within one year of the balance sheet date. If the deposit will not be returned within one year of the balance sheet date, it will be reported as a long-term asset.",what
What is capital surplus?,"In the past, capital surplus was used to describe what is now referred to as paid-in capital in excess of par.
For example, when a corporation issues shares of its common stock and receives more than the par value of the stock, two accounts are involved: 1) the account Common Stock is used to record the par value of the shares being issued, and 2) the amount that is greater than the par value is recorded in an account entitled Paid-in Capital in Excess of Par—Common Stock, or Premium on Common Stock.
Many years ago, the account Paid-in Capital in Excess of Par—Common Stock and the account Premium on Common Stock were referred to as capital surplus.",what
What is the difference between stockholder and shareholder?,There is no difference between stockholder and shareholder. The terms are used interchangeably. Both terms mean the owner of shares of stock in a corporation and a part owner of a corporation.,what
What is an asset account?,"Definition of an Asset Account
An asset account is a general ledger account used to sort and store the debit and credit amounts from a company's transactions involving the company's resources.
The balances in the asset accounts will be summarized and reported on the company's balance sheet.
Generally, the asset account balances are debit balances and are increased with a debit entry and decreased with a credit entry.
Examples of Asset Accounts
Some examples of asset accounts include Cash, Accounts Receivable, Inventory, Prepaid Expenses, Investments, Buildings, Equipment, Vehicles, Goodwill, and many more.
Two asset accounts, Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Accumulated Depreciation, are known as contra asset accounts since these accounts are expected to have credit balances.
Asset Accounts Are Permanent or Real Accounts
Asset accounts are referred to as permanent or real accounts since they are not closed at the end of the accounting year. Instead, each asset account's balance at the end of the accounting year is carried forward to become the beginning balance of the next accounting year.",what
What is the difference between reserve and allowance?,"More than 60 years ago, accountants in the U.S. used Reserve for Bad Debts as the title of the contra account associated with Accounts Receivable or Loans Receivable. They also used Reserve for Depreciation as the title of the contra account associated with plant assets. The use of the word reserve led some readers of the financial statements to conclude that money was set aside for replacing plant assets or the uncollectible accounts or loans. To avoid this misunderstanding, the accounting profession recommended that the word reserve have a very limited use. Accountants now use Allowance for Doubtful Accounts or Allowance for Bad Debts instead of Reserve for Bad Debts. In the case of plant assets, Accumulated Depreciation is used in place of Reserve for Depreciation.",what
What is an escrow payment?,"An escrow payment is an amount deposited with another party and it is to be released only for its specified purpose.  The following is one example of an escrow payment.
A borrower and lender arrange for the borrower's monthly mortgage payment to include an amount equal to one-twelfth of the property's annual real estate tax. Assuming the annual tax is $6,000 the monthly mortgage payment will include an escrow payment of $500. When the lender receives these monthly escrow payments of $500 each, the lender must hold them in escrow, or hold the funds in an escrow account. When the annual real estate taxes come due, the lender pays the real estate taxes by using the money in the borrower's escrow account.",what
What is the chart of accounts?,"The chart of accounts is a listing of the general ledger accounts to which amounts can be posted. The chart of accounts is a helpful tool for identifying the best account for recording a transaction.
In some accounting software the chart of accounts may be the means to open new general ledger accounts and to control their position in the financial statements.
Usually the chart of accounts begins with the balance sheet accounts followed by the income statement accounts. The accounts will usually be in the same order as they are presented on the two financial statements.",what
What is the difference between an adjunct account and a contra account?,"Let's illustrate adjunct and contra accounts with bonds payable. If a corporation issues $100,000 of its bonds payable for a price of 97, it will be issuing the bonds at a discount of 3%. Its journal entry will include a debit to Cash for $97,000; a credit to Bonds Payable for $100,000; and a debit to Discount on Bonds Payable for $3,000. Discount on Bonds Payable is a contra account because it is a liability account with a debit amount. The carrying value of the bonds will begin at $97,000 since the $100,000 in Bonds Payable is offset by the $3,000 debit in Discount on Bonds Payable.
If a corporation issues $300,000 of bonds at a price of 102, it will be issuing the bonds at a premium of 2%. The journal entry will include a debit to Cash for $306,000; a credit to Bonds Payable for $300,000; and a credit to Premium on Bonds Payable for $6,000. Since a credit balance is the normal balance for a liability account, the account Premium on Bonds Payable cannot be referred to as a contra account. Here is where the term adjunct account is used. Immediately after the bonds are issued, the bonds will have a carrying value of $306,000 ($300,000 PLUS $6,000).
Some people might use the term adjunct accounts for both the Discount on Bonds Payable and for the Premium on Bonds Payable. Others might use the term valuation accounts.
Other examples of contra accounts include Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, Accumulated Depreciation, Discount on Notes Payable, Bond Issue Costs, Discount on Notes Receivable, LIFO Reserve, and certain investment accounts.",what
Should a cash discount be recorded as a reduction to an expense?,"Yes, a cash discount should be a reduction to an expense. After all, accountants  define cost as the cash amount (or cash equivalent amount) at the time of the transaction.
To illustrate, let's assume that your company receives marketing consulting services and is billed $10,000 with terms of 1/10, net 30. If the bill is paid within 10 days, the cost is $9,900 ($10,000 minus the 1% discount of $100). This means that Cash should be credited for $9,900 and that the account Marketing Consulting Expenses should be debited $9,900. The cost of the marketing services was the cash price of $9,900.
It would be wrong to record $10,000 as a debit  to Marketing Consulting Expenses and to record a credit  of $100 in the account Cash Discounts. The reason is that the Cash Discounts is usually intended to be a contra account for Purchases, which is used by companies that purchase goods for resale.",what
Why does a company debit Purchases instead of Inventory?,"Under the periodic inventory system a company determines its inventory value based on an estimated or actual physical count of goods multiplied by the unit costs of the items. As a result, the costs of the goods purchased by the company will be debited to the temporary account Purchases. Under the periodic inventory system, there will also be temporary accounts that will be credited for Purchase Returns and Allowances and for Purchase Discounts.
If a company wants its Inventory account to have a running dollar amount, it will use the perpetual inventory system. Under the perpetual inventory system, the costs of the goods purchased are debited to Inventory. The perpetual system also requires that the Inventory account be credited for the cost of the goods sold, for purchase returns and allowances, and for purchase discounts.",what
Is depreciation a temporary account?,"Depreciation Expense is a temporary account since it is an income statement account. As a temporary account, Depreciation Expense will begin each accounting year with a zero balance and will have its balance at the end of the year closed to an equity account such as retained earnings or a proprietor's capital account.
On the other hand, the balance sheet account Accumulated Depreciation is not a temporary account. Accumulated Depreciation is a contra asset account and its balance is not closed at the end of each accounting period. As a result, Accumulated Depreciation is a viewed as a permanent account.",what
What are sales taxes?,"In the United States, most of its 50 States assess a sales tax, which is a tax on sales to the end user. For example, in the state of Wisconsin a retailer must collect a 5% sales tax and perhaps another 0.5% for a county sales tax on specified goods and services. The retailer must remit the sales taxes collected within a prescribed time period.
The items subject to sales tax will vary from state to state. In some states basic food items might not be taxed, but meals at restaurants will be subject to sales tax. Some services might be subject to a sales tax. Sales of raw materials to a manufacturer will be exempt if the materials will be used in products that will be manufactured and sold. When the products are sold by the manufacturer to a retailer for resale, the manufacturer will be also be  exempt from collecting a sales tax. Sales by retailer to an end consumer will require the collection of sales taxes. Sales tax can be viewed as a tax on consumption.
In accounting, the sales taxes collected by the seller of the goods or services are not revenues for the seller. For example, if a merchant sells an item for $100 and the item is subject to a 5% sales tax, the merchant will debit Cash for $105 and will credit Sales for $100 and will credit Sales Tax Payable for $5. Sales Tax Payable is a liability account. When the sales taxes are remitted to the state, the merchant will debit Sales Tax Payable.",what
Is an automobile loan payment an expense?,"Only the interest portion of an automobile loan payment is an expense. The principal portion of the loan payment is a reduction of the loan balance, which is reported as a Note Payable or Loan Payable in the liability section of the balance sheet.
Expressed another way, an automobile loan payment consists of two components: an interest payment and a principal payment. While the loan payment is a cash outflow or an expenditure, only the interest portion is an expense that will be reported on a company's income statement.",what
Are fixed assets the same as plant assets?,"I use the term fixed assets to mean the same as plant assets. In other words, I believe that both fixed assets and plant assets refer to the assets reported on the balance sheet as Property, Plant and Equipment.",what
What is net purchases?,"Definition of Net Purchases
Net purchases is the term used for the combination of the amounts recorded in the following general ledger temporary accounts: Purchases, Purchases Discounts, and Purchases Returns and Allowances. These accounts are used by companies having inventories of goods and which use the periodic inventory system in their general ledgers.
Examples of Net Purchases
To illustrate the calculation of net purchases, let's assume that a company had the following activity:

the account Purchases shows a debit balance of $250,000 which is the gross amount of its purchases of goods that were bought to resell
the account Purchases Discount shows a credit balance of $3,000 as a result of the company earning early payment discounts that were offered by its vendors
the account Purchases Returns and Allowances has a credit balance of $9,000 resulting from vendors' credit memos received by the company

Based on the above activity the company's net purchases are $238,000 ($250,000 - $3,000 - $9,000).",what
Where is the discount on the purchase of office furniture recorded?,"The discount received on the purchase of office furniture that will be used by a company is recorded in the same asset account in which the office furniture is recorded. That account might be Furniture and Fixtures or Office Furniture. (The discount is not recorded in Purchase Discounts as this account is only for the discounts on the purchase of merchandise that will be sold.)
To illustrate, let's assume that a company purchases furniture for the office of a newly appointed executive. The cost of the furniture is $10,000 and the invoice allows a discount of 1% if it is paid within 10 days. If the company pays the invoice within 10 days, the Furniture and Fixtures account will increase by $9,900 ($10,000 minus the discount of $100). The depreciation calculations will be based on the cost of $9,900.",what

"In bookkeeping, why are revenues credits?","In bookkeeping, revenues are credits because revenues cause owner's equity or stockholders' equity to increase.
Recall that the accounting equation, Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity, must always be in balance. The asset accounts are expected to have debit balances, while the liability and owner's equity accounts are expected to have credit balances. Therefore, when a company earns revenues, it will debit an asset account (such as Accounts Receivable) and will need to credit another account such as Service Revenues. The credit balance in Service Revenues will eventually be moved to the sole proprietor's capital account or to a corporation's Retained Earnings account (thereby increasing the credit balance in one of those owner's or stockholders' equity accounts).",what
Why would a business change its chart of accounts?,"There can be several reasons for a business to change its chart of accounts. One reason for changing the chart of accounts is to better match how the business is organized. Perhaps the chart of accounts was established when the business was much smaller (fewer products, fewer customers, fewer managers). Now the company's more sophisticated operations require more detailed reporting that is segmented by processes and/or by each manager's area of responsibility.
Another reason for changing the chart of accounts is a company's decision to acquire and install a new computerized system for controlling its operations. The new system's general ledger might result in a chart of accounts which is different from the previous chart of accounts.",what
What is a permanent account?,"Definition of Permanent Account
In accounting, a permanent account refers to a general ledger account that is not closed at the end of an accounting year. The balance in a permanent account is carried forward to the subsequent year, where it becomes the beginning balance for the new year.
Permanent accounts are also known as real accounts.
Examples of Permanent Accounts
Generally, the balance sheet accounts are permanent accounts, except for the owner's drawing account which is a balance sheet account and a temporary account. (The owner's drawing account is a temporary account because its balance is closed to the owner's capital account at the end of each year in order to begin the next year with a $0 balance.) 
Examples of permanent accounts are:

Asset accounts including Cash, Accounts Receivable, Inventory, Investments, Equipment, and others
Liability accounts such as Accounts Payable, Notes Payable, Accrued Liabilities, Deferred Income Taxes, etc.
Owner's (Stockholders') equity accounts including Owner's Capital, Common Stock, Retained Earnings, and others",what
Should a retailer's delivery surcharges be reported as revenues or as other income?,"I believe that a retailer's delivery surcharges are a price adjustment and should be reported as operating revenues. The surcharges are operating revenues that will be matched with the higher operating expenses such as gasoline. The delivery surcharges should not be reported as nonoperating revenues or other income. Nonoperating revenues or other income items would be outside the main activities of the retailer and would include items such as interest earned or the gain on the sale of a plant asset.
The retailer can record the delivery surcharges in a separate operating revenue account. In other words the sales revenues account could be used to record the revenues excluding the surcharges and then another sales revenue account could be designated as the delivery surcharge revenues account. Those two accounts would then be added together to report total operating revenues.",what
What is the proper use of the words lend and borrow?,"If a company is granted a loan from its bank, the company is borrowing money from its bank, and the bank is lending money to one of its customers. In other words, the bank is the lender and the loan customer is the borrower.
To use your friend's car, you might ask ""May I borrow you car? or ""Will you lend me your car?"" If your friend agrees, you are borrowing your friend's car and your friend is lending his or her car.",what
What is the cost of goods manufactured?,"Definition of Cost of Goods Manufactured
The cost of goods manufactured is a calculation of the production costs of the goods that were completed during an accounting period. In other words, it includes the costs of direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead that are included in the products that moved from the manufacturing area to the finished goods inventory during the accounting period. The calculation is presented as a schedule or statement.
Example of the Cost of Goods Manufactured
The formula and format for presenting the cost of goods manufactured is:

The cost of the direct materials used 
PLUS the cost of the direct labor used 
PLUS the cost of manufacturing overhead assigned
EQUALS = the manufacturing costs incurred in the current accounting period
PLUS the cost of the beginning work-in-process inventory
MINUS the cost of the ending work-in-process inventory

The cost of goods manufactured is similar to a retailer's cost of goods purchased. Hence a manufacturer's cost of goods sold is computed as:

The cost of the beginning finished goods inventory
PLUS the cost of the goods manufactured
MINUS the cost of the ending finished goods inventory

The cost of goods manufactured is covered in detail in a cost accounting course. In addition, AccountingCoach PRO includes a form for preparing a schedule of the Cost of Goods Manufactured.",what
What is contribution margin?,"Definition of Contribution Margin
In accounting, contribution margin is defined as: revenues minus variable expenses. The contribution margin can be expressed as an amount and/or as a ratio or percent of revenues.
The contribution margin tells us how much of the revenues will be available (after the variable expenses are covered) for the fixed expenses and net income.
The contribution margin amount or ratio (ratio) can be presented for:

The company as a whole
A product line
An individual unit of a product

Example of Contribution Margin
Let's assume that a manufacturer has only one product and 80,000 units were manufactured and sold during a recent year. The selling price was $10 per unit. The variable expenses were $4 per unit (consisting of manufacturing costs of $3 per unit and variable SG&A expenses of $1 per unit). The company's fixed expenses were $390,000 (consisting of fixed manufacturing costs of $300,000 and fixed SG&A expenses of $90,000).
The amount of the company's contribution margin was $480,000 calculated using the following amounts:

Revenues of $800,000 (80,000 units X $10 per unit)
Variable expenses of $320,000 (80,000 X $4 per unit)

The contribution margin ratio for the company was 60% (contribution margin of $480,000 divided by revenues of $800,000).
The contribution per unit of the company's only product was $6 consisting of revenues of $10 minus the variable expenses of $4. The contribution margin ratio for the product was also 60% (contribution margin of $6 divided by the selling price of $10).
The contribution margin is a key component in computing a company's break-even point.",what
What is prime cost?,"Definition of Prime Cost
In cost accounting, the prime cost of a manufactured product is the combination of the following:

Direct materials cost
Direct labor cost

The indirect manufacturing costs (manufacturing overhead) are not part of the product's prime cost.",what
What is scrap value?,"Definition of Scrap Value
In cost accounting, scrap value refers to a relatively insignificant amount that a manufacturer receives from the sale of production materials that remain after the manufacture of its products. 
In financial accounting, the term scrap value might be used instead of the more common terms of salvage value, disposal value, or residual value when calculating the depreciation of an asset used in the business. In this situation, scrap value is the expected or estimated value of the asset at the end of its useful life.
Examples of Scrap Value
A manufacturer of aluminum products melts aluminum. In the process it separates out small amounts of aluminum containing impurities. The relatively small amount of money that the manufacturer receives for the impure aluminum is known as the scrap value.
For examples of scrap value that is meant to be the disposal, residual, or salvage value of a plant asset, see our major topic Depreciation.",what
What is the difference between prime costs and conversion costs?,"Cost Categories of a Manufactured Product
Prime costs and conversion costs pertain to the three cost categories of a manufactured product:

Direct materials
Direct labor
Manufacturing overhead 

Definition of Prime Costs
Prime costs are the combination of the two direct product costs:

Direct materials costs
Direct labor costs

Definition of Conversion Costs
Conversion costs are the two categories of manufacturing costs that are needed to convert the direct materials into products:

Direct labor costs
Manufacturing overhead costs

As you can see, the direct labor costs are considered to be both a prime cost and a conversion cost.",what
What is the contribution margin ratio?,"Definition of Contribution Margin Ratio
The contribution margin ratio is the percentage of sales revenues, service revenues, or selling price remaining after subtracting all of the variable costs and variable expenses. 
Expressed another way, the contribution margin ratio is the percentage of revenues that is available to cover a company's fixed costs, fixed expenses, and profit.
Note that the contribution margin ratio is not the same as the gross margin ratio or gross profit percentage. Further, the contribution margin ratio cannot be computed from the amounts appearing on a company's external income statement.
Example of Contribution Margin Ratio
Assume that a company manufactures and sells a single product and has the following information:

Selling price per unit is $20
Fixed manufacturing costs per month is $18,000
Variable manufacturing costs per unit is $4
Fixed SG&A expenses per month is $12,000
Variable SG&A expenses per unit is $2
Fixed interest expense per month is $1,000

Using the above information the contribution margin per unit is $14 (the selling price of $20 minus the variable manufacturing costs of $4 and variable SG&A expenses of $2). Therefore, the contribution margin ratio is 70% (the contribution margin per unit of $14 divided by the selling price of $20). This contribution margin ratio tells us that 70% of the sales revenues (or 70% of the selling price) is available to cover the company's $31,000 of monthly fixed costs and fixed expenses ($18,000 + $12,000 + $1,000). Once the $31,000 has been covered, 70% of the revenues will flow to the company's net income.",what
What is hurdle rate?,"Definition of Hurdle Rate
In capital budgeting, the term hurdle rate is the minimum rate that a company wants to earn when investing in a project. Therefore, the hurdle rate is also referred to as the company's required rate of return or target rate. For a company to further consider a project, its internal rate of return must equal or exceed the hurdle rate.
The hurdle rate is also used to discount a project's future cash flows to its net present value.
Example of Hurdle Rate
The absolute minimum hurdle rate should be the company's cost of capital (a blend of the cost of debt and the cost of equity). However, the hurdle rate is usually larger than the cost of capital when the company has many investment opportunities and for projects that have a higher level of risk.",what
What is an incremental cost?,"Definition of Incremental Cost
An incremental cost is the difference in total costs as the result of a change in some activity. Incremental costs are also referred to as the differential costs and they may be the relevant costs for certain short run decisions involving two alternatives.
Note: Incremental costs may include more than the change in variable costs.
Example of Incremental Cost
Let's assume that a company has the following experience:

Total cost of manufacturing 8,000 units of Product X is $320,000, or $40 per unit
Total cost of manufacturing 10,000 units of Product X is $360,000, or $36 per unit

From the above information, we see that the incremental cost of manufacturing the additional 2,000 units (10,000 vs. 8,000) is $40,000 ($360,000 vs. $320,000). Therefore, for these 2,000 additional units, the incremental manufacturing cost per unit of product will be an average of $20 ($40,000 divided by 2,000 units). The reason for the relatively small incremental cost per unit is due to the cost behavior of certain costs. For example, when the 2,000 additional units are manufactured most fixed costs will not change in total although a few fixed costs could increase.",what
What is managerial accounting?,"Definition of Managerial Accounting
Managerial accounting is also known as management accounting and it includes many of the topics that are included in cost accounting.
Some of the managerial topics involve the computation of a manufacturer's product costs that are needed for the external financial statements which must comply with US GAAP. Other topics involve analyses and reports that are not distributed outside of the company but are used by management in its decision making and in the planning and control of the business operations.
Examples of Managerial Accounting Topics
Managerial accounting topics often include:

Job order costing
Process costing
Absorption costing vs. variable costing
Understanding cost behavior and cost-volume-profit analysis
Operational budgeting
Standard costing and variance analysis
Activity based costing
Pricing of individual products and services
Analyzing the profitability of product lines, customers, territories, etc.
Capital budgeting
Ratio analysis",what
What is a standard cost?,"Definition of Standard Cost
A standard cost is described as a predetermined cost, an estimated future cost, an expected cost, a budgeted unit cost, a forecast cost, or as the ""should be"" cost. Standard costs are often an integral part of a manufacturer's annual profit plan and operating budgets.
When standard costs are used in a manufacturing setting, a product's standard cost for a future accounting period will consist of the following:

Direct materials: a standard quantity of each material and a standard cost per unit of material
Direct labor: a standard quantity of labor and a standard cost per hour of labor
Manufacturing overhead: a budget for the fixed overhead, the standard variable overhead rate, and the standard quantity for applying a fixed and variable overhead rates

In a standard costing system, the standard costs of the manufacturing activities will be recorded in the inventories and the cost of goods sold accounts. Since the company must pay its vendors and production workers the actual costs incurred, there are likely to be some differences. The differences between the standard costs and the actual manufacturing costs are referred to as  cost variances  and will be recorded in separate variance accounts. Any balance in a variance account indicates that the company is deviating from the amounts in its profit plan.
While standard costs can be a useful management tool for a manufacturer, the manufacturer's external financial statements must comply with the cost principle and the matching principle. Therefore, significant variances must be reviewed and properly assigned or allocated to the cost of goods sold and/or inventories.
AccountingCoach PRO includes forms to assist in a better understanding of standard costs and their related variances.",what
What are indirect manufacturing costs?,"Definition of Indirect Manufacturing Costs
Indirect manufacturing costs are a manufacturer's production costs other than direct materials and direct labor. Indirect manufacturing costs are also referred to as manufacturing overhead, factory overhead, factory burden, or burden.
US GAAP requires that indirect manufacturing costs be allocated to, assigned to, or absorbed by the manufacturer's output (in addition to the cost of direct materials and direct labor) for its external financial statements. This is known as absorption costing and must be used in determining a manufacturer's cost of goods sold and the cost of its inventory.
In traditional cost accounting, the indirect manufacturing costs are allocated to the products manufactured based on direct labor hours, direct labor costs, or production machine hours. However, in recent decades the indirect manufacturing costs have increased significantly and are less likely to be caused by the quantity of direct labor or production machine hours. (This may not be a problem for financial reporting when the amount of inventory is consistently small, but it can be a problem for pricing and other decisions.)
Examples of Indirect Manufacturing Costs
Some examples of indirect manufacturing costs include:

depreciation, repairs and maintenance, electricity, etc. for the production facilities and the production equipment
salaries, wages and fringe benefits of the indirect manufacturing personnel such as production supervisors, material handlers, quality assurance, and other factory support personnel
factory supplies, outside services pertaining to manufacturing, and other manufacturing related costs",what
What do negative variances indicate?,"Definition of Negative Variances on Accounting Reports
Negative variances are the unfavorable differences between two amounts, such as:

The amount by which actual revenues were less than the budgeted revenues
The amount by which actual expenses were greater than the budgeted expenses
The amount by which actual net income was less than the budgeted net income
The amount by which current revenues were less than the previous year's revenues
The amount by which actual expenses were greater than the previous year's expenses
The amount by which the actual net income was less than the budgeted net income

The negative variances, which are unfavorable in terms of a company's profits, are usually presented in parentheses. On the other hand, positive variances in terms of a company's profits are presented without parentheses.
Examples of Negative Variances on Accounting Reports
Assume that a company had the following following information for a recent month:

Budgeted revenues of $30,000
Budgeted expenses of $22,000
Budgeted net income of $8,000
Actual revenues of $28,500
Actual expenses of $20,800
Actual net income of $7,700

Based on the above information, the company's will be reported as shown here:

Revenues variance: ($1,500). The amount is a negative or unfavorable variance because the actual revenues were $28,500 instead of the budgeted revenues of $30,000. The difference of $1,500 is unfavorable for the company's profitability.
Expenses variance: $1,200. The amount is a positive or favorable variance because the actual expenses of $20,800 are less than the budgeted expenses of $22,000. The difference of $1,200 is favorable for the company's profitability.
Net income variance: ($300). The amount is a negative or unfavorable variance because the actual net income of $7,700 is less than the budgeted net income of $8,000. The difference of ($300) is an unfavorable outcome for the company. The amount also agrees with the combination of the unfavorable revenues variance of ($1,500) and the positive expenses variance of $1,200.

To assist the readers of the accounting reports with variances being reported to indicate on the report: ""( ) = an unfavorable effect on net income.""",what
What is relevant range?,"Definition of Relevant Range
In accounting, the term relevant range usually refers to a normal range of volume or normal amount of activity in which the total amount of a company's fixed costs will not change as the volume or amount of activity changes. The term relevant range is included in the definition of fixed costs, because if a company's volume were to decline to an extremely low level, the company would take action to decrease its total amount of fixed costs. Similarly, if the company's volume were to increase dramatically, the company would likely have to increase the total amount of its fixed costs . 
Example of Relevant Range
Let's assume that a manufacturer's monthly production volume is consistently between 10,000 to 13,000 units of product requiring between 20,000 to 25,000 machine hours. Within these ranges of activity, the manufacturing operations run smoothly with the same amount of monthly fixed costs, which on average are approximately $200,000 per month for the cost of supervisors, rent, depreciation, and other fixed costs.
However, if the manufacturer's volume were to drop to say 7,000 units of product and/or to 14,000 machine hours, it would likely reduce the number of its supervisors, the space it rents, and some other fixed costs in order to reduce the $200,000 of monthly fixed costs. If the company's volume were to increase to 18,000 units of product and/or 30,000 machine hours, the company would likely have to increase its total fixed costs to pay for additional supervisors, space, and other fixed costs. Hence, an experienced accountant would say that the company's fixed costs are approximately $200,000 per month within a relevant range of activity.",what
What is a plant-wide overhead rate?,"A plant-wide overhead rate is a single rate used to assign or allocate all of a company's manufacturing overhead costs to its production output. (Manufacturing overhead costs are the indirect costs of production such as repairs, maintenance, depreciation, electricity, supervision, etc.) Often the plant-wide rate is an amount per machine hour, an amount per labor hour, or a percentage of a product's direct costs.
Using a plant-wide rate is logical when there is one root cause of the indirect production costs and the company manufactures similar products. For example, a company with a simple manufacturing operation that produces similar products could have a plant-wide overhead rate of $40 per machine hour if it has budgeted $800,000 of total manufacturing overhead costs and it expects to produce 20,000 machine hours of good output.
On the other hand, if the company manufactures diverse products, some of which use expensive equipment while some use only inexpensive equipment, a plant-wide rate is not appropriate. In response to this situation, manufacturers have developed departmental overhead rates. Thus, only the products that use the expensive equipment in a specific department will be assigned a higher overhead rate of perhaps $70 per departmental machine hour. The products requiring a simpler operation such as assembling may be assigned overhead at a rate of perhaps $20 per direct labor hour.
Some companies have moved beyond both the plant-wide rate and the departmental rates because they want to consider all of the activities that are driving up manufacturing overhead costs. These companies are attempting to find the root causes of the indirect manufacturing costs so they can assign the costs to products in a more logical manner (instead of merely spreading the costs arbitrarily via plant-wide or departmental production hours). This effort is known as activity based costing.",what
What are production costs?,"Definition of Production Costs
In managerial accounting and cost accounting, production costs are the costs that occur in the manufacturing facilities.
Production costs are also referred to as manufacturing costs, product costs, and a manufacturer's inventoriable costs.
Examples of Production Costs
A manufacturer's production costs consists of the costs for the following:

Direct materials
Direct labor
Manufacturing overhead",what
What is a fixed budget?,"Definition of Fixed Budget
A fixed budget is a budget that does not change or flex for increases or decreases in volume. (""Volume"" could be sales, units produced, or some other activity.) A fixed budget is also known as a static budget.
Example of Fixed Budget
To illustrate a fixed budget, let's assume that a company pays a 5% sales commission on all of its sales. If the company prepares a fixed budget and it is projecting sales of $1 million, the budget for sales commissions will be fixed at $50,000. If the actual sales end up being only $900,000 the budget for sales commissions will remain unchanged at the fixed amount of $50,000. If the actual sales are $1,100,000 the budget for sales commissions will also be $50,000.
Had the company prepared a flexible budget, the budget for sales commissions would be expressed as 5% of sales. This means that the budget for sales commissions will be $50,000 only when sales are $1 million. If the company has actual sales of $900,000, the budget for sales commissions will flex and will be $45,000 (5% of $900,000). If the actual sales are $1,100,000 the budget for sales commissions will be $55,000.",what
What is a cost variance?,"Definition of Cost Variance
Generally a cost variance is the difference between the actual amount of a cost and its budgeted or planned amount. For example, if a company had actual repairs expense of $950 for May but the budgeted amount was $800, the company had a cost variance of $150. When the actual cost is more than the budgeted amount, the cost variance is said to be unfavorable. When an actual cost is less than the budgeted amount, the cost variance is said to be favorable.
Cost Variances in Standard Costing Systems
Cost variances are a key part of the standard costing system used by some manufacturers. In such a system, the cost variances direct attention to the difference between 1) the standard, predetermined and expected costs of the good output, and 2) the actual manufacturing costs incurred. These cost variances send a signal to management that the company is experiencing actual costs that are different from the company's plan.
Standard costing systems report a minimum of two cost variances for each of the following manufacturing costs:

Direct materials
Direct labor
Manufacturing overhead",what
What is sales mix?,"Definition of Sales Mix
Sales mix is the relative proportion or ratio of a business's products that are sold. Sales mix is important because a company's products usually have different degrees of profitability. Sales mix also applies to service businesses since the services provided will likely have different levels of profitability.
Example of Sales Mix
Let's assume that an automobile company plans to sell 100,000 units in the current year. The planned sales mix is 20,000 units of very-low-profit models + 50,000 units of medium-profit models + 30,000 units of very-high-profit models. In other words, the planned sales mix is 20%, 50%, 30%. With this volume and sales mix the company is planning to have a small operating loss.
Now let's assume that the total units actually sold were only 95,000 units. Having 5,000 fewer units sold could mean a huge operating loss. However, the company's loss (or profit) depends on the actual sales mix. What if the actual sales indicates that 15% of 95,000 units sold were the very-low-profit units, 45% of the sales were the medium-profit units were sold, and 40% of the sales were the very-high-profit units. In other words, this more favorable sales mix (15-45-40 instead of 20-50-30) could result in an operating profit (instead of the planned loss) even with 5,000 fewer units sold.",what
What is work-in-process inventory (WIP)?,"You can think of work-in-process (WIP) inventory as the goods that are on the factory floor. The manufacturing of these goods has begun but has not yet been completed.
You can also think of work-in-process inventory as the general ledger current asset account that reports the cost of the goods that are on the factory floor. In the U.S. the cost reported as WIP should be the cost of the direct materials, direct labor and the allocation of manufacturing overhead for the goods on the factory floor.
As the WIP goods become completely manufactured, their cost will be credited to the WIP account and will be debited to the Finished Goods Inventory account.
You can expect to see the cost of a manufacturer's work-in-process inventory in the notes to its financial statements.",what
What is the coefficient of correlation?,"Definition of Coefficient of Correlation
In simple linear regression analysis, the coefficient of correlation (or correlation coefficient) is a statistic which indicates an association between the independent variable and the dependent variable. The coefficient of correlation is represented by ""r"" and it has a range of -1.00 to +1.00. 
When the coefficient of correlation is a positive amount, such as +0.80, it means the dependent variable is increasing when the independent variable is increasing. It also means that the dependent variable is decreasing when the independent variable is decreasing. However, a high positive correlation does not guarantee there is a cause and effect relationship. (A negative amount indicates an inverse association...the dependent variable is decreasing when the independent variable is increasing and vice versa.)
A coefficient of correlation of +0.8 or -0.8 indicates a strong correlation between the independent variable and the dependent variable. An r of +0.20 or -0.20 indicates a weak correlation between the variables. When the coefficient of correlation is 0.00 there is no correlation.
Relationship of Coefficient of Correlation to Coefficient of Determination
When the coefficient of correlation is squared, it becomes the coefficient of determination. This means that a coefficient of correlation of +0.80 will result in a coefficient of determination of 0.64 or 64%. (The coefficient of determination of 0.64 tells you that 64% of the change in the total of the dependent variable is associated with the change in the independent variable.) An r of +0.20 or -0.20 will result in an r-squared of only 4% (0.20 x 0.20), which means that only 4% of the change in the dependent variable is explained by the change in the independent variable.",what
What is a variable cost?,"A variable cost is a constant amount per unit produced or used. Therefore, the total amount of the variable cost will change proportionately with volume or activity. Generally, a product's direct materials are a variable cost.
To illustrate, let's assume that a bakery uses one pound of flour at a cost of $0.70 per pound for every loaf of bread it produces. If no bread is produced the total cost of flour is $0. If one loaf is produced the total cost of flour is $0.70. When 10 loaves are produced the total cost of flour is $7.00. At the volume of 30 loaves the cost of flour is $21 (30 loaves X 1 pound X $0.70 per pound).
An expense can also be a variable cost. For instance, if a company pays a 5% sales commission on every sale, the company's sales commission expense will be a variable cost. When the company has no sales the total sales commission expense is $0. When sales are $100,000 the sales commission expense will be $5,000. Sales of $200,000 will mean total sales commission expense of $10,000. Sales of $400,000 will result in total sales commission expense of $20,000.",what
What are direct materials?,"Direct materials are the traceable matter used in manufacturing a product. The direct materials for a manufacturer of dessert products will include flour, sugar, eggs, milk, vegetable oil, spices, and other ingredients in the recipes. In manufacturing, the direct materials are listed in each product's bill of materials. (Indirect materials such as oil for greasing the baking pans, etc. will likely be viewed as part of the manufacturing supplies and will be allocated to products along with other manufacturing overhead.)
The direct materials contained in manufactured products are also defined as:

a product cost (along with the costs of the direct labor and manufacturing overhead)
an inventoriable cost (along with the costs of direct labor and manufacturing overhead)
a prime cost (along with the cost of direct labor)

The costs of direct materials should be reported in the financial statements according to their location or position:

if not yet put into production, report as raw materials inventory on the balance sheet
if put into production but the goods are not completed, report as part of the cost of work-in-process inventory on the balance sheet
if put into production and the goods are completed but not yet sold, report as part of the cost of the finished goods inventory on the balance sheet
if put into production and the goods have been completed and sold, report as part of the cost of goods sold on the income statement",what
What is safety stock?,"Definition of Safety Stock
Safety stock is an additional quantity of an item held by a company in inventory in order to reduce the risk that the item will be out of stock. Safety stock acts as a buffer in case the sales of an item are greater than planned and/or the company's supplier is unable to deliver additional units at the expected time. If the company is a manufacturer, a safety stock of materials could minimize the risk of production being disrupted. 
Of course there are additional holding or carry costs associated with safety stock. However, the holding costs could be less than the cost of not filing a customer's order on time or having to stop its production line.
Example of Safety Stock
Assume that a company uses the economic order quantity (EOQ) model to determine the amount of product or materials it orders. Since the model requires an assumption (estimate) of annual demand, there is a risk that demand will be greater than the estimate used. Let's say that the company's EOQ is 1,000 units. As a precaution, the company may decide to always have an additional 100 units on hand as its safety stock. If demand is not constant, the company could increase the quantity of its safety stock during its peak sales periods and then reduce the quantity during periods of low sales.",what
How can I get a basic understanding of cost accounting?,"To get a basic understanding of cost accounting I recommend reading the managerial accounting topics found in the second half of an introductory accounting textbook. Such a textbook is often 1,200+ pages in length since it covers both financial and managerial accounting. (A textbook containing only financial accounting topics is not helpful.) A person in the U.S. should be able to obtain a 5-year-old edition of a 1,200-page introductory accounting textbook from a reseller on Amazon.com for approximately $5.
Generally the authors of these introductory accounting textbooks will present simpler examples and explanations than those found in managerial accounting textbooks or in cost accounting textbooks. This should make it easier to gain a basic understanding of important cost accounting concepts. Armed with this understanding, you can then return to the cost accounting textbook to tackle the more complicated issues and problems.
I believe that the introductory accounting textbooks, the managerial accounting textbooks, and the cost accounting textbooks will present 15 common cost accounting topics with varying degrees of depth and complexity.",what
What is a fixed cost?,"A fixed cost is one that does not change in total within a reasonable range of activity. For example, the rent for a production facility is a fixed cost if the rent will not change when there are reasonable changes in the amount of output or input. (Of course, if there is a need to double the output the rent will change when the company occupies additional work space.)
While a fixed cost remains constant in total, the fixed cost per unit of output or input will change inversely with the change in the quantity of output or input. For instance, if the rent of the production facility is fixed at $120,000 per year and there are 30,000 machine hours of good output during the year, the rent will be $4 ($120,000/30,000) per machine hour. If there are 40,000 machine hours during the year, the rent will be $3 ($120,000/40,000) per machine hour.
Many manufacturing overhead costs are fixed and the amounts occur in large increments. Some examples include depreciation on a company-owned factory, depreciation on machinery and equipment, salaries and benefits of manufacturing supervisors, factory administration costs, etc. One challenge for accountants is the allocation or assigning of the large fixed costs to the individual units of product (which likely vary in size and complexity). This allocation (or assigning or absorbing) is required by the accounting and income tax rules for valuing inventories and the cost of goods sold. If the fixed overhead is assigned using machine hours, one must keep in mind that the cost rate per machine hour is not how the fixed costs behave or occur. In our example, the cost of the rent might be assigned to the products at the rate of $3 or $4 per machine hour but the rent actually occurs at the rate of $10,000 per month.",what
What are semivariable costs?,"Semivariable costs are costs or expenses whose behavior is partially fixed and partially variable. Semivariable costs are also referred to as mixed costs.
A common example of a semivariable cost is the annual cost of operating a vehicle. Some of the vehicle's operating costs will vary with the number of miles driven while other costs will be the same in total regardless of the miles driven. For example, the vehicle's fuel costs will be variable. However, the depreciation, insurance and licensing may be fixed. Looking only at the vehicle's maintenance costs may indicate that some maintenance is done each November (regardless of the number of miles driven) while other maintenance is done every 6,000 miles.
A manufacturer's electricity cost is another example of a semivariable cost. Part of the monthly electricity bill will include 1) a fixed amount, and 2) a separate amount based on the number of kilowatt hours of electricity actually used by the company.
The manufacturer's electricity cost is also a semivariable cost in relationship with the company's machine hours. The portion of the electricity cost used to operate the production equipment is variable, but the portion of the electricity cost used for lighting and air conditioning the manufacturing facility is a fixed cost.
These simple examples illustrate that it can be difficult to understand how costs behave. There are many factors, activities, and drivers that influence the level of costs.",what
What is simple linear regression analysis?,"Simple linear regression analysis is a statistical tool for quantifying the relationship between just one independent variable (hence ""simple"") and one dependent variable based on past experience (observations). For example, simple linear regression analysis can be used to express how a company's electricity cost (the dependent variable) changes as the company's production machine hours (the independent variable) change.
Fortunately there is software to compute the best fitting straight line (hence ""linear"") that expresses the past relationship between the dependent and independent variable. Continuing our example, you will enter 1) the amount of the past monthly electricity bills, and 2) the number of machine hours occurring during the period of each of the bills. Next, the software will likely use the least squares method to produce the formula for the best fitting line. The line will appear in the form y = a + bx. In addition, the software will provide statistics regarding the correlation, confidence, dispersion around the line, and more.
(In all likelihood there are many independent variables causing a change in the amount of the dependent variable. Therefore, you should not expect that only one independent variable will explain a high percentage of the change in the dependent variable. To increase the percentage, you should think of the many independent variables that could cause a change in the dependent variable. Next you should test the effect of the combination of these independent variables or drivers by using multiple regression analysis software.)
Prior to using simple linear regression analysis it is important to follow these preliminary steps:

seek an independent variable that is likely to cause or drive the change in the dependent variable
make certain that the past amounts for the independent variable occur in the exact same period as the amount of the dependent variable
plot the past observations on a graph using the y-axis for the cost (monthly electricity bill) and the x-axis for the activity (machine hours used during the exact period of the electricity bill)
review the plotted observations for a linear pattern and for any outliers
keep in mind that there can be correlation without cause and effect",what
What are nonmanufacturing overhead costs?,"Nonmanufacturing overhead costs are the business expenses that are outside of a company's manufacturing operations. These are often referred to as the selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses plus the company's interest expense. Examples of the nonmanufacturing overhead costs include the salaries and other expenses for the following business activities: selling, distribution, marketing, finance, IT, human resources, legal, and so on. (We have additional examples within our AccountingCoach.com topic Nonmanufacturing Overhead.)
Since these costs are outside of the manufacturing function, they are not considered to be costs of the products. As a result, the nonmanufacturing costs are not allocated to the products for determining the costs for inventory or for the cost of goods sold. Instead, the nonmanufacturing costs are immediately expensed in the accounting period in which they are incurred. That is why accountants say that the nonmanufacturing costs are period costs or period expenses. (Only the manufacturing costs of direct materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead are product costs.)
While the nonmanufacturing overhead costs are not allocated to the products, the company must have its selling prices and sales revenues sufficient to cover both the product costs and the period expenses in order to avoid a negative net income.",what
What are departmental overhead rates?,"Departmental overhead rates are used by many manufacturers instead of using a single, plant-wide overhead rate. The reason for departmental overhead rates is that a manufacturer is likely to produce many diverse products which use different processes (each of which has different costs).
To illustrate, let's assume that a manufacturer has three operations with each occurring in a separate department:

Dept #1 uses a large, sophisticated machine having a cost of $900,000
Dept #2 uses a small $40,000 machine to refine the products coming out of Dept #1
Dept #3 is an additional, optional process that uses a $10,000 machine

When the manufacturer divided its total manufacturing overhead for the upcoming year by the total machine hours for the upcoming year, the result was a plant-wide overhead rate of $30. If Product A requires 7 hours in Dept #1 and 1 hour in Dept #2, it will be assigned overhead of $240 [(7+1)X$30]. If Product B requires 2 hours in Dept #1, 2 hours in Dept #2, and 4 hours in Dept #3, it will also be assigned overhead of $240 [(2+2+4)X$30].
When departmental overhead rates were computed, the manufacturing overhead rate for Dept #1 was $50 per machine hour (resulting from high amounts of depreciation, electricity, maintenance, etc.). The overhead rate per machine hour for Dept #2 was $20, and $15 for Dept #3. Using the more accurate departmental overhead rates Product A will be assigned overhead of $370 [(7X$50)+(1X$20)]. Product B will be assigned overhead of $200 [(2X$50)+(2X$20)+(4X$15)].
Having multiple, departmental overhead rates will better reflect the costs of manufacturing Product A and Product B compared to using a single, plant-wide overhead rate.",what
What is practical capacity?,"Practical capacity is a manufacturer's level of output (often expressed in machine hours, barrels, pounds, etc.) that is less than its theoretical or ideal capacity. For example, if a manufacturer has theoretical capacity of 2,080 hours based on 8 hours per day for 5 days per week for 52 weeks, its practical capacity might be only 1,860 hours. The 220 hour difference could be associated with repairs, maintenance, setups, plant shutdowns for holidays, and other downtime. Hence, a manufacturer's practical capacity is more realistic than its theoretical capacity.
However, the manufacturer's annual output to meet its sales orders and production schedules could be considerably less than its practical capacity. As a result, cost accountants will also review 1) the annual machine hours that normally occurs over a span of several years, and 2) the number of machine hours expected in the upcoming year.
In the long run, it is important that manufacturers plan and control their theoretical, practical, normal and next year's budgeted capacity levels.",what
What does stepped cost mean?,"Stepped cost refers to the behavior of the total cost of an activity at various levels of the activity. When a stepped cost is plotted on a graph (with the total cost represented by the y-axis and the quantity of the activity represented by the x-axis) the lines will appear as steps or stairs rising from left to right.
To illustrate a stepped cost, let's assume that you are developing a website and find that the monthly cost of hosting the site is based on the number of visits. For 0 to 999 visits per month, the cost is $20 per month. When the visits are in the range of 1,000 to 2,999 the monthly cost jumps to $50. If the visits are 3,000 to 9,999 the cost will be $200 per month. For monthly visits of 10,000 to 24,999 the cost is $300, and so on. As the data indicates, the total monthly cost is constant or fixed only for a given range of activity (number of visits). When the number of visits exceeds the upper limit of a range, the monthly cost jumps to a higher level and remains fixed until the visits exceed the new upper limit.
A stepped cost is also referred to as a step cost, a step-variable cost, or a step-fixed cost. The difference between a step-variable cost and a step-fixed cost has to do with the width of the range of activity. If the total cost increases with small increases in activity, it may be referred to as a step-variable cost. If the total cost will change only with large increases in the quantity of activity, the term step-fixed cost is more likely to be used.
Knowing how costs behave is important for decision making. For example, a manufacturer will want to know how its costs will increase if a new product line is added (or how costs could decrease if an existing product line is eliminated).",what
What are net incremental cash flows?,"Net incremental cash flows are the combination of the cash inflows and the cash outflows occurring in the same time period, and between two alternatives. For example, a company could use the net incremental cash flows to decide whether to invest in new, more efficient equipment or to retain its existing equipment.
Net incremental cash flows are necessary for calculating an investment's:

net present value
internal rate of return
payback period

To illustrate net incremental cash flows let's assume that Your Corporation has the opportunity to purchase a product line from Divesting Company for a single cash payment of $800,000. Your Corporation expects that the product line will result in the following cash flows occurring in each year for 10 years:

additional cash receipts or cash inflows of $900,000 (from the collection of accounts receivable related to product sales)
additional cash payments or cash outflows of $750,000 (for payments related to the product line's costs and expenses)

These cash flows indicate that the net incremental cash flows are expected to be a positive $150,000 per year for 10 years, or that there will be net incremental cash inflows of $150,000 per year for 10 years.",what
What is the production volume variance?,"The production volume variance is associated with a standard costing system used by some manufacturers. This variance indicates the difference between 1) the company's budgeted amount of fixed manufacturing overhead costs, and 2) the amount of the fixed manufacturing overhead costs that were assigned to (or absorbed by) the company's production output.
To illustrate the production volume variance, let's assume that a manufacturer had budgeted $300,000 of fixed manufacturing overhead (supervisors' compensation, depreciation, etc.) for the upcoming year. During that period it expected to have 30,000 machines hours of good output. Based on this plan the manufacturer established a fixed manufacturing overhead rate of $10 per standard machine hour. If the company actually produces 29,000 standard machine hours of good output, the products will be assigned (or will have absorbed) $290,000 of the fixed manufacturing overhead. This will cause an unfavorable production volume variance of $10,000 ($300,000 budgeted vs. $290,000 assigned; or 1,000 too few standard machine hours of good output X $10 per standard machine hour).
If our example had stated that the manufacturer actually produced 32,000 standard machine hours of good output, the products would have been assigned $320,000 of fixed manufacturing overhead costs compared to the budgeted amount of $300,000. This scenario would result in a favorable production volume variance of $20,000 ($300,000 budgeted vs. $320,000 assigned; or 2,000 additional standard machine hours of good output X $10 per standard machine hour).",what
What is a flexible budget variance?,"Definition of Flexible Budget and Flexible Budget Variance
First, a flexible budget is a budget in which some amounts will increase or decrease when the level of activity changes. A flexible budget variance is the difference between 1) an actual amount, and 2) the amount allowed by the flexible budget.
Static Budget vs. Flexible Budget
To help in understanding the flexible budget variance, let's assume that you are the manager of a company's shipping department. You prepared the department's annual budget based on the company's assumption that 50,000 items will be shipped during the budget year. If the annual budget is not changed when more or less than 50,000 items are shipped, it is referred to as a static budget. A summary of the department's static budget based on shipping 50,000 items is:
Fixed expenses (salaries, utilities, etc.) of $350,000 + variable expenses (cartons, helpers, etc.) of $150,000 (50,000 items X $3 each) = total static budget of $500,000.
Unlike the static budget, a flexible budget for the shipping department will increase when more than 50,000 items for the year are shipped and it will decrease when fewer than 50,000 items are shipped. Let's assume that for the year, the department actually shipped 54,000 items. Therefore, the flexible budget for the variable expenses will ""flex"" for shipping the additional 4,000 items. The resulting flexible budget summary is:
Fixed expenses (salaries, utilities, etc.) of $350,000 + variable expenses (cartons, helpers, etc.) of $162,000 (54,000 items X $3 each) = total flexible budget of $512,000.
Flexible Budget Variance
Now let's assume that the shipping department's actual expenses for the year were:
Fixed expenses of $351,000 + variable expenses of $157,000 = total actual expenses of $508,000.
The department's total flexible budget variance is $4,000 favorable since the actual expenses of $508,000 were less than the flexible budget of $512,000.
Note that the shipping department's total static budget variance is $8,000 unfavorable since the actual expenses of $508,000 were more than the static budget of $500,000.
The $12,000 difference between the two variances result from the flexible budget being increased by $12,000 to recognize that an additional 4,000 items had to be shipped at a budgeted shipping cost of $3 per item.
Flexible Budgets Could Flex for Various Activities
The activities that could cause flexible budgets to flex might be the amount of sales, units of output, machine hours, miles traveled, etc.",what
What is a BOM?,"BOM is the acronym for bill of materials. A BOM is a listing of the quantities of each of the materials used in manufacturing a product.
Industrial manufacturers are likely to have an enormous number of BOMs. Each of the BOMs will be a very detailed list of all of the quantities of every material used in the various steps of manufacturing each part or product.
To visualize a BOM, think of a bakery that produces only pies. Each pie's BOM will list the ingredients in the pie's recipe. Each BOM will list the number of pounds (or other unit of measure) of the specific fruit, the quantity of a specific sugar (or other sweetener), the quantity and type of cinnamon, the quantity of nutmeg, the type of crust. There will also be a BOM for the pie crust. The pie crust BOM will specify the quantity and type of flour, the quantity and type of butter (or oil), the quantity of salt, etc.",what
What is theoretical capacity?,"Theoretical capacity is the level of a manufacturer's production that would be attained if all of its equipment and operations performed continuously at their optimum efficiency. Theoretical capacity is also referred to as ideal capacity.
As the names imply, the theoretical capacity or ideal capacity is not realistic due to repairs, maintenance, setups, and other factors that will result in down time.",what
What is a product cost?,"Definition of a Retailer's Product Cost
In accounting, a retailer’s product cost is the cost paid to a supplier plus any other costs that are necessary to get the product in place and ready for sale. For example, if a retailer pays $40 to its supplier and then pays $10 to get it delivered to its warehouse, the retailer’s product cost is $50. 
Definition of a Manufacturer's Product Cost
A manufacturer’s product cost includes the cost of each product’s raw materials plus the costs of converting the raw materials into products. The manufacturer's product costs are usually classified into three groups:

Raw materials used in the product
Direct labor used to make the product
Manufacturing overhead incurred to make the product

Since the manufacturing overhead costs are indirect costs, they must be allocated to the products manufactured to comply with financial accounting standards and U.S. income tax regulations. The details for allocating or assigning the manufacturing costs to the products manufactured are contained in the college course known as cost accounting or managerial accounting.
Product Costs Are Used for Inventory and Cost of Goods Sold
Both the product costs of a retailer and the product costs of a manufacturer are also referred to as inventoriable costs, since the product costs are used to value their goods in inventory. When the goods are sold, the product costs will be removed from inventory and will appear on the income statement as the cost of goods sold.
SG&A Not Included in Product Costs
The selling, general, administrative (SG&A) and interest costs of a retailer and/or a manufacturer are not product costs. Rather, they are reported as expenses on the income statement of the accounting period in which they were incurred.",what
What is a predetermined overhead rate?,"A predetermined overhead rate is often an annual rate for assigning or allocating indirect manufacturing costs to the goods it produces. Manufacturing overhead is allocated to products for various reasons including compliance with U.S. accounting principles and income tax regulations. 
A predetermined annual overhead rate is likely computed shortly before the start of the accounting year in which it will be used. The computation of the rate is 1) the budgeted amount of manufacturing overhead for the upcoming year divided by 2) the budgeted or normal number of machine hours (or some other activity) for the upcoming year. Using annual amounts (and the resulting annual rate) eliminates the monthly and seasonal fluctuations which may occur. 
A manufacturer producing only a few similar products might use a plant-wide overhead rate. However, if the products require different processes, it is better for each process to have its own specific overhead rate. These multiple overhead rates are also known as departmental overhead rates.",what
What is opportunity cost?,"Opportunity cost is the profit that was lost or missed because of some action or failure to take some action.
To illustrate opportunity cost, let's assume that you want to add a website to your already successful business. You are confident that it will increase your company's profit by $1,500 each week. A highly-trusted and successful firm will complete the website in 3 weeks with a total cost of $10,000. A friend has offered to do the work for $6,500 but it will take 5 weeks.
Choosing your friend looks better because the $3,500 saved ($6,500 instead of $10,00) is less than the opportunity cost of $3,000 (the $1,500 per week that is not earned multiplied times the additional 2 weeks it will take your friend to develop the website).
Now let's assume that your friend will require 7 weeks to complete the website. This means that your business will be losing the opportunity to earn an additional $1,500 per week for 4 weeks (your friend's 7 weeks instead of the firm's 3 weeks). That opportunity cost of $6,000 plus the $6,500 payment means a total cost of $12,500 if your friend develops the website. Hence, you would be better off paying the firm $10,000 and the benefit of having the site working 4 weeks sooner.
Interestingly, the opportunity costs are not recorded in the general ledger accounts. Hence, only the $6,500 paid to your friend will be recorded as the cost of the website. (The 4 weeks of missed profits are not recorded and will not be widely discussed.)
This is also a reminder that the opportunity costs and future amounts are the important ones for making decisions. Unfortunately, the future amounts are not in the general ledger and are probably not known at the time a decision has to be made.",what
What is the coefficient of determination?,"The coefficient of determination is a statistic which indicates the percentage change in the amount of the dependent variable that is ""explained by"" the changes in the independent variables.
For example, a manufacturer may have found through simple linear regression analysis involving 15 monthly observations that 64% of the change in the total cost of electricity (the dependent variable) was associated with the change in the monthly production machine hours (the independent variable). In this example the coefficient of determination is 0.64 or 64%.
The coefficient of determination is symbolized by r-squared, where r is the coefficient of correlation. Hence, a coefficient of determination of 0.64 or 64% means that the coefficient of correlation was 0.8 or 80%. (The range for the coefficient of correlation is -1 to +1, and therefore the range for the coefficient of determination is 0 to +1.)
It is important to note that a high coefficient of determination does not guarantee that a cause-and-effect relationship exists. However, a cause-and-effect relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable will result in a high coefficient of determination.",what
How can a manufacturer determine the precise cost of its products?,"A manufacturer may never be able to determine the precise cost of its individual products. The reason is that most of the manufacturing costs (other than materials and some labor) are indirect costs. This means that most of the manufacturing costs are not directly traceable to individual products and will need to be allocated to them. Examples of indirect manufacturing costs include the rent, property taxes, depreciation, heat, lighting, indirect production workers pay and benefits, repairs, maintenance, and others that occur in the factory.
In addition to the manufacturing costs, there are selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses and perhaps interest expense. Generally, accountants do not consider these expenses to be product costs. As a result these expenses are reported on the income statement when they occur and without any allocation to the products. However, these expenses are associated with some or all of the products.
The manufacturer can attempt to calculate the costs and expenses of each of its products, but I don't think the result will be the true, precise cost. In addition to the allocations (which are viewed as arbitrary), consider that changes in volume will affect a product's cost. For example, if a company's total fixed costs remain constant but its volume of products decreases by 20%, the cost of each product will increase. If volume increases, the cost of each product will decrease.
Activity-based costing (ABC) is an attempt to improve the allocation of costs by identifying more of the root causes of the costs (rather than merely spreading costs to products based on machine hours). Even with ABC there will be arbitrary allocations which will prevent knowing each product's precise cost.",what
What is a dependent variable?,"In accounting, a dependent variable is likely to be the total of a mixed cost that will change as the result of several factors. A factor that causes the change in the total cost is referred to as the independent variable.
To illustrate, assume that a manufacturer wants to estimate its total electricity cost for each month. The total electricity cost will be the dependent variable. Since the manufacturer's machines use large amounts of electricity, the total cost of electricity is dependent on the number of machine hours. In this example, the machine hours will be an independent variable. (It is likely that there will be many independent variables that cause the change in the amount of the dependent variable.)
The dependent variable is usually expressed as y or y' (the estimated amount of y) and the amount is referenced on a graph's y-axis. (An independent variable is expressed as x and is referenced on a graph's x-axis.) Hence the equation for the monthly electricity cost will be y = a + bx, which signifies that the total electricity cost (y) for a specific month is equal to a fixed cost (a) plus a variable cost rate (b) multiplied times the number of machine hours (x) occurring during the month.",what
What is an independent variable?,"In accounting, an independent variable is ideally a factor that causes a change in the total amount of the dependent variable. In other words, an independent variable should be something that drives a mixed cost to increase or decrease.
To illustrate, let's assume that a manufacturer's production equipment uses a significant amount of electricity. Hence, the monthly electricity cost (the dependent variable) will increase when there is an increase in the number of production machine hours (the independent variable).
In reality there are likely to be many independent variables that cause a change in the amount of the dependent variable. In the case of the monthly electricity cost, the independent variables could also include the non-production machines using electricity, the physical size of the products, the skill level of the operators, the outside temperature and humidity, etc.
Multiple regression analysis is a statistical tool that can assist in determining the significant independent variables.",what
Should a manufacturer's selling prices be based on costs?,"A manufacturer's selling prices should not be based on costs alone. One reason is that the actual cost of each product is not known with precision. At best, each product's cost is an average that resulted from allocations of the indirect manufacturing costs. In addition, there are selling, general and administrative expenses that are even more difficult to associate with individual products.
A more compelling reason that selling prices should not be based solely on costs is the market for a product. If a product is unique, protected by a patent and trademark, and the demand for the product is high, customers may accept a selling price that is unusually high. In other words, the value of the product is much greater than the costs identified with the product plus a normal profit or markup.
At other times the market will include competitors offering a similar product at lower selling prices because of efficiencies, lower costs, or inaccurate cost calculations. Perhaps another competitor will sell a similar product at a lower selling price in hopes of attracting customers who will buy additional, more profitable products. These situations will likely prevent the manufacturer from achieving significant sales at selling prices that are based on costs plus a desired profit.
Given the complexity of a manufacturer's operations and the competition in the market place, it is rare for a manufacturer to have selling prices based on its true costs plus a uniform rate of profit.",what
What is a favorable variance?,"Definition of a Variance
In accounting the term variance usually refers to the difference between an actual amount and a planned or budgeted amount. For example, if a company's budget for supplies expense is $30,000 and the actual amount is $28,000 or $34,000, there will be a variance of $2,000 or $4,000 respectively. Similarly, if a company has budgeted its revenues to be $200,000 and its actual revenues end up being $193,000 or $208,000, there will be a variance of $7,000 or $8,000 respectively.
When is a Variance Favorable
A favorable variance indicates that the variance or difference between the budgeted and actual amounts was good or favorable for the company's profits. In other words, this variance will be one reason why the amount of the company's actual profits will be better than the budgeted profits.
Favorable Expense Variance
For example, if supplies expense was budgeted to be $30,000 but the actual supplies expense ends up being $28,000, the $2,000 variance is favorable because having fewer expenses than were budgeted was good for the company's profits. It is one reason why the company's actual profits will be better than the budgeted profits.
Favorable Revenue Variance
If a company had budgeted its revenues to be $200,000 and the actual revenues end up being $208,000, the company will have a favorable variance of $8,000. The variance is favorable because having the actual revenues being more than the amount budgeted is good for the company's profits. It will also be a factor why the company's actual profits will be better than the budgeted profits.",what
What is an outlier?,"In cost accounting, an outlier could be a cost or its related level of activity that is out of line with other observations.
An outlier can be detected by plotting each observation's cost and related level of activity onto a graph or scatter diagram. If one of those points deviates from the pattern of the other points, it is said to be an outlier.  The outlier could be the result of an accounting error, an unusual charge, or a unique change in volume.
To avoid developing an incorrect formula for estimating future costs, the outlier should be investigated and perhaps excluded.",what
What is boilerplate?,"In business, boilerplate is a term to describe the standard wording that is contained in warranties and other documents. Generally, the information that is boilerplate is not subject to change. Boilerplate is sometimes referred to as the fine print.
A modern day example of boilerplate would be the terms and conditions for which we click ""I agree"" or ""I accept"" when downloading software onto our computer.
Even though some wording is boilerplate, it is nonetheless part of the contract and you should assume it is relevant.
In business, boilerplate can also refer to lengthy, recurring commands in computer code.",what
What is an unfavorable variance?,"Definition of a Variance
In accounting the term variance usually refers to the difference between an actual amount and a planned or budgeted amount. For example, if a company's budget for repairs expense is $50,000 and the actual amount ends up being $45,000 or $63,000, there will be a variance of $5,000 or $13,000 respectively. Similarly, if a company has budgeted its revenues to be $280,000 and the actual revenues end up being $271,000 or $291,000, there will be a variance of $9,000 or $11,000 respectively.
When is a Variance Unfavorable
The term unfavorable variance indicates that the variance (or difference between the budgeted and actual amounts) was not good for the company's profits. In other words, this unfavorable variance is one reason for the company's actual profits being worse than the budgeted profits. 
Unfavorable Expense Variance
If repairs expense was budgeted to be $50,000 but the actual repairs expense ends up being $63,000, the $13,000 variance is unfavorable because having more actual expenses than were budgeted was not good for the company's profits. It is one reason why the company's actual profits were worse than the budgeted profits.
Unfavorable Revenue Budget
If a company has budgeted its revenues to be $280,000 and the actual revenues end up being $271,000, the company will have an unfavorable variance of $9,000. The variance is unfavorable because having less actual revenues than the budgeted amount was not good for the company's profits. It will also be one reason for the company's actual profits being worse than the budgeted profits.",what
What is a general ledger account?,"Definition of General Ledger Account
A general ledger account is an account or record used to sort, store and summarize a company's transactions. These accounts are arranged in the general ledger (and in the chart of accounts) with the balance sheet accounts appearing first followed by the income statement accounts.
Examples of General Ledger Accounts
Some of the more common balance sheet accounts and how they are further arranged in the general ledger include:

asset accounts such as Cash, Accounts Receivable, Inventory, Investments, Land, and Equipment
liability accounts including Notes Payable, Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses Payable, and Customer Deposits
stockholders' equity accounts such as Common Stock, Retained Earnings, Treasury Stock, and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

Some of the general ledger income statement accounts and how they are arranged include:

operating revenue accounts such as Sales and Service Fee Revenues
operating expense accounts including Salaries Expense, Rent Expense, and Advertising Expense
nonoperating or other income accounts such as Gain on Sale of Assets, Interest Expense, and Loss on Disposal of Assets

General Ledger Control Accounts
Some general ledger accounts can become summary records and will be referred to as control accounts. In that situation all of the detail that supports the summary amounts in one of the control accounts will be available in a subsidiary ledger.
Examples of General Ledger Control Accounts
A common example of a general ledger account that can become a control account is Accounts Receivable. The summary amounts are found in the Accounts Receivable control account and the details for each customer's credit activity will be contained in the Accounts Receivable subsidiary ledger.
Other general ledger accounts that may become control accounts include Inventory, Equipment, and Accounts Payable.",what
What is the double-entry system?,"Definition of Double-Entry System
The double-entry system of accounting or bookkeeping means that for every business transaction, amounts must be recorded in a minimum of two accounts. The double-entry system also requires that for all transactions, the amounts entered as debits must be equal to the amounts entered as credits.
Example of a Double-Entry System
To illustrate double entry, let's assume that a company borrows $10,000 from its bank. The company's Cash account must be increased by $10,000 and a liability account must be increased by $10,000. To increase an asset, a debit entry is required. To increase a liability, a credit entry is required. Hence, the account Cash will be debited for $10,000 and the liability Loans Payable will be credited for $10,000.
Double Entry Keeps the Accounting Equation in Balance
Double entry also means that the accounting equation (assets = liabilities + owner's equity) will always be in balance. In our example, the accounting equation remained in balance because both assets and liabilities were each increased by $10,000.",what
What is a trial balance?,"Definition of a Trial Balance
A trial balance is a bookkeeping or accounting report that lists the balances in each of an organization's general ledger accounts. (Often the accounts with zero balances will not be listed.) The debit balance amounts are listed in a column with the heading ""Debit balances"" and the credit balance amounts are listed in another column with the heading ""Credit balances."" The total of each of these two columns should be identical.
Examples of the Trial Balance's Use
The trial balance is not a financial statement. It is mainly an internal report that is/was useful in a manual accounting system. If the trial balance did not ""balance"" it signaled an error somewhere between the journal and the trial balance. Often the cause of the difference was a miscalculation of an account balance, posting a debit amount as a credit (or vice versa), transposing digits within an amount when posting or preparing the trial balance, etc.
Today's accounting software has been written to eliminate those errors. Hence, the trial balance is less important for bookkeeping purposes since it is almost certain that the general ledger and the trial balance will have the debits equal to the credits.
The trial balance continues to be useful for auditors and accountants who wish to show 1) the general ledger account balances prior to their proposed adjustments, 2) their proposed adjustments, and 3) all of the account balances after the proposed adjustments. The adjusted amounts make up the adjusted trial balance, and the adjusted amounts will be used in the organization's financial statements.",what
What is a journal entry?,"Definition of a Journal Entry
In manual accounting or bookkeeping systems, business transactions are first recorded in a journal...hence the term journal entry.
Journal entries that are recorded in a company's general journal will consist of the following:

the appropriate date
the account(s) and amount(s) that will be debited
the account(s) and amount(s) that will be credited
a short description/memo/reference

The journal entries appear in a journal in order by date and are then posted to the appropriate accounts in the general ledger.
Computerized accounting systems will automatically record most of the business transactions into the general ledger accounts immediately after the software prepares the sales invoices, issues checks to creditors, processes receipts from customers, etc. Hence, we will not write journal entries for most of the business transactions.
Examples of Journal Entries
Even with computerized accounting systems some general journal entries are necessary. Common general journal entries are the adjusting entries. For example, prior to issuing the company's financial statements there will be an adjusting entry to record depreciation. This journal entry will debit Depreciation Expense and will credit Accumulated Depreciation.
Another example of a general journal entry is the adjusting entry to accrue interest on a bank loan. This journal entry will debit Interest Expense and will credit Interest Payable.",what
What is the difference between a general ledger and a general journal?,"Definition of General Ledger
The general ledger contains the accounts used to sort and store a company's transactions.
The general ledger is organized so that the accounts will appear in the following order: 

Balance sheet accounts: assets, liabilities, stockholders' equity
Income statement accounts: operating revenues, operating expenses, other revenues and gains, other expenses and losses

The balances and activity in the general ledger accounts are used to prepare a company's financial statements.
Definition of General Journal
A general journal is used to record unique journal entries that cannot be processed in a more efficient manner. For example, checks written, sales invoices issued, purchase invoices received, and others can be recorded in a computerized accounting system when the documents are processed. Manual accounting systems will likely use special journals for recording routine transactions. Therefore, the general journal will have a limited amount of entries. 
In the general journal you must enter the account(s) to be debited and the account(s) to be credited along with their amounts and a brief description. Once a transaction is recorded in the general journal, the amounts are then posted to the appropriate accounts in the general ledger.
Examples of Using the General Journal
The following are examples of entries that will be recorded in the general journal:

Depreciation
Other adjusting entries
Bad debts
Sale of an asset used in the business",what
What is the difference between an accrual and a deferral?,"Definition of an Accrual
An accrual pertains to:

expenses that should be reported now, but have not yet been recorded or paid, and
revenues that should be reported now, but have not yet been recorded nor has the money been received

Example of an Expense Accrual
The accrual of an expense or an expense accrual refers to the reporting of an expense and the related liability in an accounting period that is prior to the period when the amount will be paid or the vendor's invoice will be processed. An example of an expense accrual is the electricity that is used in December where neither the bill nor the payment will be processed until January. The December electricity should be recorded as of December 31 with an accrual adjusting entry that debits Electricity Expense and credits a liability account such as Accrued Expenses Payable.
Example of a Revenue Accrual
The accrual of revenues or a revenue accrual refers to the reporting of revenue and the related asset in the period in which they are earned, and which is prior to processing a sales invoice or receiving the money. An example of the accrual of revenues is a bond investment's interest that is earned in December but the money will not be received until a later accounting period. This interest should be recorded as of December 31 with an accrual adjusting entry that debits Interest Receivable and credits Interest Income.
Definition of a Deferral
A deferral occurs when a company has:

paid out money that should be reported as an expense in a later accounting period, and/or
received money that should be reported as revenue in a later accounting period

Example of an Expense Deferral
A deferral of an expense or an expense deferral involves a payment that was paid in advance of the accounting period(s) in which it will become an expense. An example is a payment made in December for property insurance covering the next six months of January through June. The amount that is not yet expired should be reported as a current asset such as Prepaid Insurance or Prepaid Expenses. The amount that expires in an accounting period should be reported as Insurance Expense.
Example of a Revenue Deferral
A deferral of revenues or a revenue deferral involves money that was received in advance of earning it. An example is the insurance company receiving money in December for providing insurance protection for the next six months. Until the money is earned, the insurance company should report the unearned amount as a current liability such as Unearned Insurance Premiums. As the insurance premiums are earned, they should be reported on the income statement as Insurance Premium Revenues.",what
What does debit memo mean on a bank statement?,"Definition of Bank Debit Memo
A debit memo on a company's bank statement refers to a deduction by the bank from the company's bank account. In other words, a bank debit memo reduces the bank account balance similar to a check drawn on the bank account.
Examples of a Bank Debit Memo
Some examples of a bank debit memo include the following withdrawals from a company's checking account:

The company's monthly loan payment
The fee for printing the company's checks
The fee for handling a check that the company deposited and the check was returned because of insufficient funds
A transfer of funds to another account at the bank

The bank's use of the term debit memo is logical because the company's bank account is a liability in the bank's general ledger. (The bank accepted the company's cash which is recorded by a debit to the bank's Cash account, and the bank credits its liability account Customer Deposit Accounts. The liability is appropriate since the bank has the obligation to return the customer's money on demand). The bank's liability is reduced when the bank charges the company's account for a bank fee. Hence, the credit balance in the bank's liability account is reduced by a debit.
In the company's general ledger, the bank debit memo will reduce the company's checking account (which is an asset) and will require the company to credit its Cash account (and debit another account such as Bank Fees Expense).",what
What is the meaning of debit?,"Definition of Debit
The term debit is similar to the term used in Italy more than 500 years ago when the double entry accounting system was documented. What you need to know today is that debit means left or left side. For example, every accounting entry will have a debit entered on the left side of a general ledger account. (There will also need to be a credit amount entered on the right side of another account.) The abbreviation for debit is dr. (which is also related to the term from 500 years ago).
Since the general ledger accounts have both a debit and credit side, or left and right side, the balance in a general ledger account will be either a debit balance or a credit balance.
Within the general ledger, these accounts are expected to have debit balances: assets, expenses, and the owner's drawing account. The debit balances will be increased when additional debit amounts are entered, and will be decreased when credit amounts are entered.
Examples of Debit
To illustrate the term debit, let's assume that a company has cash of $500. Therefore, the company's general ledger asset account Cash should indicate a debit balance of $500. If the company receives an additional $200, a debit of $200 will be entered and will result in the Cash account having a debit balance of $700.
Sometimes the word charge is used in place of debit. For example, if a company spends $300 for advertising, a credit of $300 will be recorded in the Cash account, and an accountant might add ""...and charge Advertising Expense for $300."" Another accountant might say ""...and debit Advertising Expense for $300.""",what
What is a suspense account?,"Definition of Suspense Account
A suspense account is a general ledger account in which amounts are temporarily recorded. The suspense account is used because the appropriate general ledger account could not be determined at the time that the transaction was recorded.
As soon as possible, the amount(s) in the suspense account should be moved to the proper account(s).
Example of Using a Suspense Account
An accountant was instructed to record a significant number of journal entries written by the controller of a large company. Unfortunately, there was one amount that did not have an account designated. In order to complete the assignment by the deadline, the accountant recorded the ""mystery"" amount in the general ledger Suspense account. When the controller is available, the accountant will get clarification and will move the amount from the Suspense account to the appropriate account.",what
What entry is made when selling a fixed asset?,"Defining the Entries When Selling a Fixed Asset
When a fixed asset or plant asset is sold, there are several things that must take place:

The fixed asset's depreciation expense must be recorded up to the date of the sale
The fixed asset's cost and the updated accumulated depreciation must be removed
The cash received must be recorded
The difference between the amounts removed in 2. and the cash received in 3. is recorded as a gain or loss on the sale of the fixed assets

Example of Entries When Selling a Plant Asset
Assume that on January 31, a company sells one of its machines that is no longer used for $3,000. Depreciation was last recorded on December 31. Also assume that the depreciation expense is $400 per month and the general ledger shows the machine's cost was $50,000 and its accumulated depreciation at December 31 was $39,600.
On January 31, the date the machine is sold, the company must record January's depreciation. This entry debits $400 to Depreciation Expense and credits $400 to Accumulated Depreciation.
Also on January 31, the company must debit Cash for $3,000 (the amount received); debit Accumulated Depreciation for $40,000 (the balance after the January 31 entry); debit Loss of Sale of Fixed Assets $7,000; and credit Machines for $50,000.
The $7,000 loss recorded on January 31 is the result of removing the machine's book value of $10,000 (cost of $50,000 minus its accumulated depreciation of $40,000), and replacing it with $3,000 of cash.
If the cash that the company received was greater than the asset's book value, the company would record the difference as a credit to Gain on Sale of Fixed of Assets.",what
What is the difference between a trial balance and a balance sheet?,"Definition of Trial Balance
A trial balance is an internal report that remains in the accounting department. The trial balance lists all of the accounts in the general ledger and their balances (or all of the accounts that have balances). However, the debit balance amounts are entered in one column and the credit balance amounts are entered in another column. Each column is then summed to prove that the total of the debit balances is equal to the total of the credit balances. (In a manual accounting system, the trial balance would draw attention to the errors occurring when transactions were journalized, posted, account balances computed, etc. With accounting software, these clerical errors are unlikely.)
Definition of Balance Sheet
A balance sheet is one of the five financial statements that are distributed outside of the accounting department and are often distributed outside of the company. The balance sheet summarizes and reports the balances from the asset, liability, and stockholders' equity accounts that are contained in the company's general ledger. The balance sheet is also referred to as the statement of financial position.",what
What is miscellaneous expense?,"Definition of Miscellaneous Expense
In accounting, miscellaneous expense may refer to a general ledger account in which small, infrequent transaction amounts are recorded. The account Miscellaneous Expenses should be used as the last resort. For example, the small bank fees would be better recorded in a separate account such as Bank Service Charges instead of recording them in Miscellaneous Expenses.
Miscellaneous expense may also be the description on a company's income statement that refers to the amount consisting of small balances contained in many general ledger expense accounts.",what
When do you put parentheses ( ) around a number?,"Definition of Amounts in Parentheses
Parentheses around a number could have a variety of meanings. For example, parentheses could indicate any of the following:

A negative amount, such as a negative balance in your check register
A credit balance in an account that normally has a debit balance, or a debit balance in an account that normally has a credit balance
A credit entry, when a debit entry will not have parentheses
An unfavorable variance in standard costing, as opposed to a favorable variance which will not have parentheses
An unfavorable budget variance (e.g. an actual expense is more than the budgeted amount, or actual revenues are less than the budgeted amount)
An amount that is being subtracted
The meaning of a negative amount in a series of amounts, such as the bottom line of a comparative income statement that states ""Net income (loss)""",what
What are reversing entries and why are they used?,"Definition of Reversing Entries
Reversing entries are made on the first day of an accounting period to remove accrual adjusting entries that were made at the end of the previous accounting period. Two benefits of using reversing entries are:

It greatly reduces the chance of double-counting revenues and/or expenses, and
It allows for more efficient processing of the actual invoices that will be processed in the new
accounting period

Example of Reversing Entries
To illustrate reversing entries, let's assume that a retailer uses a temporary employment agency service to provide workers from December 15 to December 29. The temp agency will bill the retailer on January 6 and the retailer is required to pay the invoice by January 10. Assuming the retailer's accounting year ends on December 31, the retailer will make an accrual adjusting entry on December 31 for the estimated amount. If the estimated amount is $18,000 the retailer will debit Temp Service Expense for $18,000 and will credit Accrued Expenses Payable for $18,000. This adjusting entry assures that the retailer's income statement for the period ended December 31 will report the $18,000 expense and its balance sheet as of December 31 will report the $18,000 liability.
After the financial statements are prepared, the closing entries will transfer the balance in the account Temp Service Expense to an owner's/stockholders' equity account. As a result, the account Temp Service Expense will begin January with a zero balance. 
When a reversing entry is recorded as of January 1, it simply removes the estimated amounts contained in the December 31 accrual adjusting entry. In other words, the January 1 reversing entry will:

Debit Accrued Expenses Payable for $18,000, and
Credit Temp Service Expense for $18,000

After the January 1 reversing entry, the account Accrued Expenses Payable will have a zero balance, and the account Temp Service Expense will have an unusual credit balance of $18,000.
When the temp agency's invoice dated January 6 arrives, the retailer can simply debit the invoice amount to Temp Service Expense and credit Accounts Payable (the normal routine procedure). If the actual invoice is $18,000 the balance in Temp Service Expense will change from a credit balance of $18,000 to a balance of $0. (Zero is the correct expense for the new accounting period, since the $18,000 had been reported as an expense in the previous accounting period.) Thanks to the reversing entry, the person paying the retailer's bills can do what is done for any other vendor invoice.
If the invoice amount on January 6 had been $18,250 the entire amount would be debited to Temp Service Expense and credited to Accounts Payable. The resulting debit balance of $250 in Temp Service Expense will be reported as a January expense. Since the $250 is insignificant difference from an estimated amount, it is acceptable to report the $250 as a January expense instead of a December expense.",what
What is an account?,"Definitions of Account
In accounting, an account is a record in the general ledger that is used to sort and store transactions. For example, companies will have a Cash account in which to record every transaction that increases or decreases the company's cash. Another account, Sales, will collect all of the amounts from the sale of merchandise. Most accounting systems require that every transaction will affect two or more accounts. For example, a cash sale will increase the Cash account and will increase the Sales account.
The term account is also used in transactions where suppliers sell goods to customers and grant credit terms such as net 10 days. In those situations, a supplier is selling goods on account and the customer has purchased goods on account. The supplier has also increased the balance in its current asset account entitled Accounts Receivable and the customer will increase the balance in its current liability account entitled Accounts Payable.",what
Which accounts normally have debit balances?,"Assets, expenses, losses, and the owner's drawing account will normally have debit balances. Their balances will increase with a debit entry, and will decrease with a credit entry.
Liabilities, revenues and sales, gains, and owner equity and stockholders' equity accounts normally have credit balances. These accounts will see their balances increase when the account is credited. Their balances will decrease when they debited.
For example, if a company borrows cash from its local bank, the company will debit its asset account Cash since the company's cash balance is increasing. The same entry will include a credit to its liability account Notes Payable since that account balance is also increasing.",what
Is Accounts Payable a debit or a credit or both?,"Definition of an Accounts Payable Credit
Since Accounts Payable is a liability account, it should have a credit balance. The credit balance indicates the amount that a company or organization owes to its suppliers or vendors.
If a company purchases additional goods or services on credit (as opposed to paying with cash), the company will need to credit Accounts Payable so that the credit balance will increase accordingly.
Definition of an Accounts Payable Debit
If a company pays one of its suppliers the amount that is included in Accounts Payable, the company will need to debit Accounts Payable so that the credit balance is decreased.",what
How do I record an advance to an employee and the deduction?,"Definition of Advance to an Employee
A cash advance to an employee is usually a temporary loan by a company to an employee. In other words, the company is the lender and the employee is the borrower.
The cash advance needs to be reported as a reduction in the company's Cash account and an increase in an asset account such as Advance to Employees or Other Receivables: Advances. (If the amount is expected to be repaid within one year, this account will be reported as a current asset.)
If the cash advance is repaid through payroll withholdings, the amount withheld will be recorded as a credit to Advance to Employees.
Example of Advance to an Employee
Let's assume that a valuable employee's car requires an emergency repair of $800. The employee is unable to pay for the repair and has no other means for getting to work. The company agrees to lend the employee $800 and to withhold $100 per week from the employee's weekly payroll checks until the $800 is repaid.
The company will debit the current asset Advance to Employees for $800 and will credit Cash for $800. The weekly payroll processing will result in a credit of $100 to Advance to Employees (thereby reducing the amount that is credited to Cash).",what
What is a contra account?,"Definition of Contra Account
A contra account is a general ledger account with a balance that is opposite of the normal balance for that account classification. The use of a contra account allows a company to report the original amount and also report a reduction so that the net amount will also be reported. The net amount is often referred to as the carrying amount or perhaps the net realizable amount.
Examples of Contra Accounts
To illustrate, let's use the contra asset account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. Since it is a contra asset account, this allowance account must have a credit balance (which is contrary to the debit balances found in asset accounts). The Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is directly related to the asset account entitled Accounts Receivable. Therefore, if the Accounts Receivable has a debit balance of $40,000 and the allowance account has a credit balance of $2,000, the readers of the balance sheet will see that customers owe $40,000 for past purchases but the company does not expect to collect $2,000 of the $40,000. Therefore, the net amount of the accounts receivable that is expected to turn to cash is $38,000.
A second example of a contra asset account is Accumulated Depreciation. For instance, if a company has a plant asset such as Equipment with a debit balance of $92,000 and the account Accumulated Depreciation has a credit balance of $50,000, the carrying amount (or book value) of the equipment is $42,000.
The income statement account Sales Returns and Allowances is a contra revenue account that is associated with the revenue account Sales. If the balance in this contra account is a debit of $3,000 and the Sales account has the expected credit balance of $400,000, the company's net sales are $397,000. This use of Sales Returns and Allowances (instead of debiting Sales) enables management to see that its customers had a problem with $3,000 of the company's goods.",what
Is the drawing account a capital account?,"Definition of Drawing Account
A sole proprietorship will have a drawing account in which the owner's withdrawals or draws of cash or other assets are recorded. The amounts of the owner's draws are recorded with a debit to the drawing account and a credit to cash or other asset. At the end of the accounting year, the drawing account is closed by transferring the debit balance to the owner's capital account.
The Drawing Account is a Capital Account
To answer your question, the drawing account is a capital account. It's debit balance will reduce the owner's capital account balance and the owner's equity. The drawing account's purpose is to report separately the owner's draws during each accounting year. Since the capital account and owner's equity accounts are expected to have credit balances, the drawing account (having a debit balance) is considered to be a contra account. In addition, the drawing account is a temporary account since its balance is closed to the capital account at the end of each accounting year. 
Example of the Drawing Account
Let's assume that L. Ott begins a sole proprietorship with a cash investment of $3,000. The journal entry will debit Cash for $3,000 and will credit L. Ott, Capital for $3,000. Later, the L. Ott withdraws $500 from the business for her personal use. The journal entry for this transaction will debit L. Ott, Drawing for $500 and will credit Cash for $500. After this transaction, the business will have assets of $2,500 and will have owner's equity of $2,500.",what
What is the difference between a nominal account and a real account?,"Definition of Nominal Account
The balance in a nominal account is closed at the end of the accounting year. As a result, a nominal account begins each accounting year with a zero balance. Since the balance does not carry forward to the next accounting year, a nominal account is also referred to as a temporary account.
Examples of Nominal Accounts
The nominal accounts are almost always the income statement accounts such as the accounts for recording revenues, expenses, gains, and losses. When the income statement accounts are closed at the end of the accounting year, the net amount will ultimately end up in a balance sheet equity account such as the proprietor's capital account or the corporation's retained earnings account.
Definition of Real Account
The balance in a real account is not closed at the end of the accounting year. As a result, a real account begins each accounting year with its balance from the end of the previous year. Because the end-of-the-year balance is carried forward to the next accounting year, a real account is also known as a permanent account.
Examples of Real Accounts
The real accounts are the balance sheet accounts such as the accounts for recording assets, liabilities, and the owner's (or stockholders') equity. However, the sole proprietor's drawing account, which is reported on the balance sheet during the year, is a temporary account because it is closed directly to the owner's capital account at the end of the year.",what
What type of account is the Dividends account?,"Definition of Dividends Account
The account Dividends (or Cash Dividends Declared) is a temporary, stockholders' equity account that is debited for the amount of the dividends that a corporation declares on its capital stock. At the end of the accounting year, the balance in the Dividends account is closed by transferring the account balance to Retained Earnings. (Corporations could debit Retained Earnings directly when dividends are declared. In that case the Dividends account is not used.) 
Example of Using the Dividends Account
When a corporation declares a cash dividend on its common stock, it will credit a current liability account Dividends Payable and will debit either:

Retained Earnings, or
Dividends

Dividends is a balance sheet account. However, it is a temporary account because its debit balance will be closed to the Retained Earnings account at the end of the accounting year.",what
Why are expenses debited?,"Why Expenses Are Debited
Expenses cause owner's equity to decrease. Since owner's equity's normal balance is a credit balance, an expense must be recorded as a debit. At the end of the accounting year the debit balances in the expense accounts will be closed and transferred to the owner's capital account, thereby reducing owner's equity. (At a corporation, the debit balances in the expense accounts will be closed and transferred to Retained Earnings, which is a stockholders' equity account.)
Example of Why Expenses Are Debited
To illustrate why expenses are debited, let's assume that a new company has only one asset, Cash of $10,000, and its owner's equity is $10,000. The company then pays $500 for advertising that occurs at the time of payment. The company must reduce its Cash (which has a debit balance of $10,000) by entering a credit of $500. To comply with double-entry accounting, the company must record a debit of $500, which will be entered in Advertising Expense. Let's also assume this was the only transaction for the year. As a result, the company's balance sheet will report assets of $9,500 and owner's equity of $9,500. As you can see, there are two reasons why Advertising Expense had to be debited:

The transaction required a credit to Cash since this asset account is being reduced. Therefore, there must also be a debit recorded in another account, namely Advertising Expense.
The owner's equity and liabilities will normally have credit balances. Since expenses reduce owner's equity, Advertising Expense must be debited for $500. Therefore, double entry requires that another account must be credited for $500. Since cash was used, the account Cash will be credited. This is logical since this asset's normal debit balance must be reduced.",what
What is prepaid insurance?,"Definition of Prepaid Insurance
Prepaid insurance is the portion of an insurance premium that has been paid in advance and has not expired as of the date of a company's balance sheet. This unexpired cost is reported in the current asset account Prepaid Insurance.
As the amount of prepaid insurance expires, the expired portion is moved from the current asset account Prepaid Insurance to the income statement account Insurance Expense. This is usually done at the end of each accounting period through an adjusting entry.
Example of Prepaid Insurance
To illustrate prepaid insurance, let's assume that on November 20 a company pays an insurance premium of $2,400 for insurance protection during the six-month period of December 1 through May 31. On November 20, the payment is entered with a debit of $2,400 to Prepaid Insurance and a credit of $2,400 to Cash.
As of November 30 none of the $2,400 cost has expired and the entire $2,400 will be reported on the balance sheet as Prepaid Insurance or Prepaid Expenses. On December 31, an adjusting entry will debit Insurance Expense for $400 (the amount that expired: 1/6 of $2,400) and will credit Prepaid Insurance for $400. This means that the debit balance in Prepaid Insurance at December 31 will be $2,000 (5/6 of the $2,400 cost), since this is the amount that has not yet expired.
At the end of each month, an adjusting entry of $400 will be recorded to debit Insurance Expense and credit Prepaid Insurance.",what
What is bookkeeping?,"Definition of Bookkeeping
Bookkeeping includes the recording, storing and retrieving of financial transactions for a business, nonprofit organization, individual, etc.
Examples of Bookkeeping Tasks
Typical financial transactions and tasks that are involved in bookkeeping include:

Billing for goods sold or services provided to clients
Recording receipts from customers
Verifying and recording invoices received from suppliers
Paying suppliers
Processing employees' pay and the related governmental reports
Monitoring individual accounts receivable
Recording depreciation and other adjusting entries
Providing financial reports

Today bookkeeping is done with the use of computer software. For example, QuickBooks (from Intuit) is a low-cost bookkeeping and accounting software package that is widely used by small businesses in the U.S.
Bookkeeping requires knowledge of debits and credits and a basic understanding of financial accounting, which includes the balance sheet and income statement.",what
What is a real account?,"Definition of a Real Account
A real account is a general ledger account that does not close at the end of the accounting year. In other words, the balances in the real accounts are carried over to become the beginning balances of the next accounting period. Real accounts are also referred to as permanent accounts.
Examples of Real Accounts
The real accounts are the balance sheet accounts which include the following:

Asset accounts (cash, accounts receivable, buildings, etc.)
Liability accounts (notes payable, accounts payable, wages payable, etc.)
Stockholders' equity accounts (common stock, retained earnings, etc.)",what
What to do with the balance in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts?,"Definition of Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
The Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is a contra asset account that is used with the balance in Accounts Receivable to report the net realizable value of the receivables. 
Example of Adjusting the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
The balance in the account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts should be the estimated amount of the company's receivables that will not be turning to cash. For example, if the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts presently has a credit balance of $2,000 and you believe there is a total of $2,900 in Accounts Receivable that will not be collected, you need to enter an additional credit amount of $900 into the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. The other part of this adjusting entry will be a debit of $900 to Bad Debts Expense.
Note that some authors and companies may refer to the allowance account as Allowance for Uncollectible Expense, Allowance for Bad Debts or Provision for Bad Debts. The related income statement account could have the title of Uncollectible Accounts Expense, Doubtful Accounts Expense, etc.",what
How is the account Cash Short and Over used?,"Definition of Cash Short and Over Account
The account Cash Short and Over is an income statement account (within a company's general ledger) in which shortages or overages of cash are recorded. The Cash Short and Over account might be used by:

A bank to record daily differences (if any) between a teller's actual cash at the end of the day versus the expected amount of cash based on checks cashed, deposits received, etc.
A company to record unexplained differences arising when a company's petty cash fund is replenished

The account Cash Short and Over provides a way to monitor employees' cash handling proficiency.
Generally, the amounts in the account Cash Short and Over are so small that the account balance will be included with other insignificant amounts reported on the income statement as Other Expenses.
Example of How the Account Cash Short and Over is Used
Let's illustrate the Cash Short and Over account with the petty cash fund. Assume that the company has a petty cash fund of $100 and its general ledger account Petty Cash reports an imprest balance of $100. Let's now assume that when the petty cash fund is replenished, there is $6.00 on hand and there are $93.00 of petty cash vouchers. This indicates a shortage of $1.00.
Using the above information, the journal entry to replenish the petty cash fund will include a credit of $94.00 to the account Cash: Checking Account. (This is the amount of the company check that will be cashed to get the cash in the petty cash fund back to the imprest general ledger amount of $100.) The debits will be the accounts and amounts shown on the petty cash receipts, which total $93. To get the journal entry to balance, a debit of $1 is recorded in Cash Short and Over.",what
What are sundry expenses?,"Definition of Sundry Expenses
In accounting and bookkeeping, sundry expenses are expenses that are small in amount and rare in occurrence. For these rare and insignificant expenses, a company might use a general ledger account entitled Sundry Expenses for these items.
If any of the items recorded in Sundry Expenses begin to occur frequently and/or become significant, a new account should be opened for such items.
Sundry expenses could also refer to a line on a company's income statement. Such a line will likely include the combined total of several expense accounts that have small balances.
Today, we are likely to use the description Miscellaneous Expenses for these items.",what
What is the proper accounting for supplies?,"Definition of Supplies
Office supplies are items used to carry out tasks in a company's departments outside of manufacturing or shipping. Office supplies are likely to include paper, printer cartridges, pens, etc. 
Shipping supplies are the cartons, tape, shrink wrap, etc. for preparing products that are being shipped to customers.
Manufacturing supplies are items used in the manufacturing facilities, but are not a direct material for the products manufactured. These will include a wide variety of items from cleaning supplies to machine lubricants.
Accounting for Office Supplies
The cost of office supplies on hand at the end of an accounting period should be the balance in a current asset account such as Supplies or Supplies on Hand. The cost of the office supplies used up during the accounting period should be recorded in the income statement account Supplies Expense. When supplies are purchased, the amount will be debited to Supplies. At the end of the accounting period, the balance in the account Supplies will be adjusted to be the amount on hand, and the amount of the adjustment will be recorded in Supplies Expense. (If the amount of supplies on hand is insignificant, a company may simply debit Supplies Expense when the supplies are purchased.) 
Accounting for Shipping Supplies
The cost of shipping supplies on hand will be reported as a current asset on the balance sheet and the shipping supplies used during the accounting period will be reported on the income statement as Shipping Supplies Expense.
Accounting for Manufacturing Supplies
The cost of manufacturing supplies on hand at the end of an accounting period will be reported in a balance sheet current asset account such as Inventory of Manufacturing Supplies. (There are likely to be several accounts or sub-accounts in order keep track of the manufacturing supplies by category.) When the manufacturing supplies are used they will become part of the manufacturing overhead, which is then allocated to the products manufactured.",what
How is a short term bank loan recorded?,"Definition of Short Term Bank Loan
When a company borrows money from its bank and agrees to repay the loan amount within a year, the company will record the loan by increasing its cash and increasing a current liability such as Notes Payable or Loans Payable. The bank will record the loan by increasing a current asset such as Loans to Customers or Loans Receivable and increasing a current liability such as Customer Demand Deposits.
Example of a Company Recording a Loan from a Bank
Let's assume that a company obtains a $30,000 bank loan that must be repaid within 9 months. The bank deposits the loan proceeds of $30,000 into the company's checking account at the same bank.
The double entry to be recorded by the company is: 1) a debit of $30,000 to the company's current asset account Cash for the amount that the bank deposited into the company's checking account, and 2) a credit of $30,000 to the company's current liability account Notes Payable (or Loans Payable) for the amount of principal that it must repay to the bank. (If there is a difference between the two amounts, it may pertain to bank fees or prepaid interest that will also have to be recorded.)
Example of a Bank Recording a Loan to a Customer
The double entry to be recorded by the bank is: 1) a debit to the bank's current asset account Loans to Customers or Loans Receivable for the principal amount it expects to collect, and 2) a credit to the bank's current liability account Customer Demand Deposits. (If there is a difference between the two amounts, it may pertain to bank fees or prepaid interest that will also have to be recorded.)",what
What is a credit balance?,"Definition of Credit Balance
In accounting and bookkeeping, a credit balance is the ending amount found on the right side of a general ledger account or subsidiary ledger account.
Examples of Credit Balances
A credit balance is normal and expected for the following accounts:

Liability accounts such as Accounts Payable, Notes Payable, Wages Payable, Interest Payable, Income Taxes Payable, Customer Deposits, Deferred Income Taxes, etc. Hence, a credit balance in Accounts Payable indicates the amount owed to vendors. (If a liability account would have a debit balance it indicates that the company has paid more than the amount owed, has made an incorrect entry, etc.)
Equity accounts including the stockholders' equity accounts Common Stock, Paid-in Capital in Excess of Par Value, Retained Earnings, and the owner's equity account M. Smith, Capital
Revenue accounts and gain accounts such as Sales Revenues, Service Revenues, Interest Revenues, Gain on Disposal of Equipment, Gain from Lawsuit, and many others
Contra-asset accounts including Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Accumulated Depreciation. These credit balances allow for the reporting of both the gross and net amounts for accounts receivable and for property, plant and equipment
Contra-expense accounts such as Purchases Discounts, Purchases Returns and Allowances, and Expenses Reimbursed by Employees. The credit balances in these accounts allow the company to report both the gross and net amounts.",what
Why are revenues credited?,"Why Revenues are Credited
Revenues cause owner's equity to increase. Since the normal balance for owner's equity is a credit balance, revenues must be recorded as a credit. At the end of the accounting year, the credit balances in the revenue accounts will be closed and transferred to the owner's capital account, thereby increasing owner's equity. (At a corporation, the credit balances in the revenue accounts will be closed and transferred to Retained Earnings, which is a stockholders' equity account.)
It may be helpful to think of the accounting equation, Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity, to understand why an asset (shown on the left side of the accounting equation) will normally have its account balance on the left side or debit side. Liabilities and owner's equity accounts (shown on the right side of the accounting equation) will normally have their account balances on the right side or credit side.
Example of Why Revenues are Credited
To illustrate why revenues are credited, let's assume that a company receives $900 at the time that it provides a service and therefore is earning the $900. The increase in the company's assets will be recorded with a debit of $900 to Cash. Since every entry must have debits equal to credits, a credit of $900 will be recorded in the account Service Revenues. The credit entry in Service Revenues also means that owner's equity will be increasing.
If the company earns an additional $500 of revenue but allows the customer to pay in 30 days, the company will increase its asset account Accounts Receivable with a debit of $500. It must also record a credit of $500 in Service Revenues because the revenue was earned. The credit entry in Service Revenues also means that the owner's equity will be increasing.",what
What is the difference between a debit and a debit balance?,"Definition of Debit
A debit is an entry on the left side of a T-account.
A debit entry is used to record assets, expenses, losses, and owner's draws in their appropriate general ledger accounts. A debit reduces the amounts in liability and owner's (stockholders') equity accounts.
Definition of Debit Balance
A debit balance is the normal balance in the general ledger accounts for assets, expenses, losses, and owner's draws.
Example of Debit and Debit Balance
Let's assume that a person starts a business as a sole proprietorship with an investment of $5,000. The entry to business accounts will include a debit to Cash for $5,000. On the next day, the business spends $1,000 to purchase office equipment. Part of this entry will include a credit to Cash for $1,000. After this transaction is recorded, the Cash account will have a debit balance of $4,000.",what
What is the income summary account?,"Definition of Income Summary Account
The Income Summary account is a temporary account used with closing entries in a manual accounting system. (Computerized accounting systems may close the temporary accounts without recording the amounts in an Income Summary account.)
The Income Summary is very temporary since it has a zero balance throughout the year until the year-end closing entries are made. Next, the balance resulting from the closing entries will be moved to Retained Earnings (if a corporation) or the owner's capital account (if a sole proprietorship).
Example of Income Summary Account
In a manual accounting system, the closing entries will result in the following amounts in Income Summary:

A credit amount for the total amount of the general ledger income statement accounts that had credit balances
A debit amount for the total amount of the general ledger income statement accounts that had debit balances

Next, if the Income Summary has a credit balance, the amount is the company's net income. The Income Summary will be closed with a debit for that amount and a credit to Retained Earnings or the owner's capital account.
If the Income Summary has a debit balance, the amount is the company's net loss. The Income Summary will be closed with a credit for that amount and a debit to Retained Earnings or the owner's capital account.",what
What is a debit balance?,"Definition of Debit Balance
In accounting and bookkeeping, a debit balance is the ending amount found on the left side of a general ledger account or subsidiary ledger account.
Examples of Debit Balances
A debit balance is normal and expected for the following accounts:

Asset accounts such as Cash, Accounts Receivable, Inventory, Prepaid Expenses, Buildings, Equipment, etc. For example, a debit balance in the Cash account indicates a positive amount of cash. (Therefore, a credit balance in Cash indicates a negative amount likely caused by writing checks for more than the amount of money currently on hand.)
Expense accounts and loss accounts including Cost of Goods Sold, Wages Expense, Rent Expense, Interest Expense, Loss on Disposal of Equipment, Loss from Lawsuit, etc. (The debit balances in these accounts will be transferred to Retained Earnings or to the proprietor's capital account at the end of each accounting year.)
Contra-revenue accounts including Sales Discounts, Sales Returns, etc. (The debit balances in these accounts allow for the reporting of both the gross and net amounts of sales. These balances will also be transferred to retained earnings or the owner's capital account at the end of each accounting year.)
Contra-liability accounts such as Discount on Bonds Payable or Unamortized Bond Issue Costs. (These debit balances allow for the presentation of both the maturity value and the book or carrying value of the bonds.)
Contra-equity accounts such as the owner's drawing account and Treasury Stock. (The debit balance in the drawing account will be closed to the owner's capital account thereby reducing the respective balance at the end of each year. The debit balance in Treasury Stock is not closed at the end of the year. It serves as a reduction to the total amount of Stockholders' Equity.)",what
What is the difference between a ledger and a trial balance?,"Definition of a Ledger
A ledger is often defined as a book of accounts. Today the ledger and its accounts are likely to be an electronic record or file.
Example of a Ledger
An example of a ledger is a company's general ledger, which contains all of its asset, liability, owner equity, revenue, expense, gain, and loss accounts. Each account contains the transaction amounts that pertain to the account title. 
Definition of a Trial Balance
A trial balance is a listing of the account names and their balances from the general ledger. The debit balance amounts are in one column and the credit balance amounts are in the adjacent column. (Usually accounts with zero balances are not listed.) If the totals of the two columns are equal, accountants are comforted in knowing that the general ledger has its debits equal to credits. The trial balance is an internal accounting report that merely documents the equality of debits and credits. It is not a financial statement.
The trial balance was crucial internal report when the accounting records were maintained and updated manually. With a manual system, part of an entry may have been omitted, one of the transaction amounts may have had digits transposed, math errors may have occurred when calculating an account's balance, etc. Today's accounting software is coded to prevent these types of errors. As a result, it is rare to see a computerized trial balance that does not have the total amount of debits equal to the total amount of credits.",what
What is a bill payable?,"Definition of Bill Payable
A bill payable is a document which shows the amount owed for goods or services received on credit (meaning not paid at the time that the goods or services were received). The provider of the goods or services is referred to as the supplier or vendor. Hence, a bill payable is also known as an unpaid vendor invoice.
Examples of Bills Payable
Examples of a bill payable include a monthly telephone bill, the monthly bill for the electricity used, a bill for repairs that were completed, the bill for merchandise purchased by a retailer on credit, etc. 
Recording a Bill Payable
Under the accrual method of accounting or bookkeeping, a bill payable or unpaid vendor invoice is recorded in Accounts Payable with a credit entry. (The debit will likely be recorded as an expense or asset.) When the bill is paid, Accounts Payable will be reduced with a debit entry, and Cash will be decreased with a credit entry.
The credit balance in Accounts Payable is reported on the company's balance sheet as a current liability.",what
What is an adjusted trial balance?,"Definition of an Adjusted Trial Balance
The adjusted trial balance is an internal document that lists the general ledger account titles and their balances after any adjustments have been made. The adjusted trial balance is not a financial statement, but the adjusted account balances will be reported on the financial statements.
The adjusted trial balance (as well as the unadjusted trial balance) must have the total amount of the debit balances equal to the total amount of credit balances.
Examples of Adjusted Trial Balances
In a manual accounting system, an unadjusted trial balance might be prepared by a bookkeeper to be certain that the general ledger has debit amounts equal to the credit amounts. After that is the case, the unadjusted trial balance is used by an accountant to indicate the necessary adjusting entries and the resulting adjusted balances. The adjusted balances are summed to become the adjusted trial balance. 
An adjusted trial balance can also refer to a trial balance where the account balances are adjusted by the external auditors. The adjusted balances become the adjusted trial balance.",what
What is a general ledger?,"Definition of General Ledger
A general ledger is a grouping of perhaps hundreds of accounts that are used to sort and store information from a company's business transactions. The general ledger is organized as follows:

balance sheet accounts (assets, liabilities, equity), and
income statement accounts (revenues, expenses, gains, losses)

Under the double entry system of accounting and bookkeeping, every business transaction will affect two (or more) general ledger accounts. In addition, each transaction's debit amount(s) must be equal to its credit amounts. As a result, the general ledger is expected to have the total amount of debits equal to the total amount of credits. Further, when the account balances are listed on a trial balance, the totals should be equal.
Examples of a General Ledger
In a manual accounting or bookkeeping system, the general ledger is a ""book"" with a separate page or ledger sheet for each account. (When a significant amount of detailed information is needed for an account such as Accounts Receivable, a subsidiary ledger is often used.)
In a computerized system, the general ledger will be an electronic file of all the needed accounts. This also facilitates the electronic preparation of the company's financial statements.",what
What is the entry to remove equipment that is sold before it is fully depreciated?,"Entries To Record a Sale of Equipment
When equipment that is used in a business is disposed of (sold) for cash before it is fully depreciated, two steps must be taken:

Record the depreciation expense right up to the date of the disposal
Remove the equipment's cost and the up-to-date accumulated depreciation, record the cash received, and record the resulting gain or loss

The first step requires a journal entry that:

Debits Depreciation Expense (for the depreciation up to the date of the disposal)
Credits Accumulated Depreciation (for the depreciation up to the date of the disposal)

The second step requires another journal entry to:

Credit the account Equipment (to remove the equipment's cost)
Debit Accumulated Depreciation (to remove the equipment's up-to-date accumulated depreciation)
Debit Cash for the amount received
Get this journal entry to balance. If a debit amount is needed (because the cash received was less than the equipment's book value), record a debit to Loss on Disposal of Equipment. If a credit amount is needed (because the cash received was greater than the equipment's book value, record a credit to Gain on Disposal of Equipment

(If the equipment is traded-in or exchanged for another asset, the second step will be different.)",what
What is the procedure for preparing a trial balance?,"Definition of a Trial Balance
A trial balance consists of the following information:

The title of each general ledger account that has a balance
To the right of the account titles are two columns for entering each account's balance. One column is headed Debit and the other column is headed Credit
Each account's balance is listed in the appropriate column
After all of the account balances are entered, each column is summed
The total of the debit column should be equal to the total of the credit column

Example of a Trial Balance
Today's accounting software can print a trial balance at the click of a mouse. Further, a computerized accounting system has eliminated the many math and clerical errors that had occurred with a manual accounting system.
Of course, a trial balance that has the total debits equal to the total credits does not mean that the general ledger is free of errors. For instance, recording a debit entry into the Equipment account instead of recording the debit in the Equipment Repairs Account will not be uncovered by the trial balance.",what
What does overstated mean?,"Definition of Overstated
When an accountant uses the term overstated, it means two things:

The reported amount is incorrect, and
The reported amount is more than the true or correct amount.

As a result of double-entry accounting or bookkeeping, another item is likely to have a reporting error.
Example of Overstated
If a company reports that its prepaid insurance is $8,000, but the true or correct amount of prepaid insurance is only $7,000, the accountant will say that the reported amount of prepaid insurance is overstated by $1,000.
Because of double-entry accounting, if the balance in the account Prepaid Insurance is overstated (too much is being reported) it is likely that the account Insurance Expense will be understated (too little is being reported).",what
What is a T-account?,"Definition of T-Account
A T-account is a visual aid used to depict a general ledger account. The account title is written above the horizontal part of the ""T"". On the left-side of the vertical line, the debit amounts are shown. On the right-side the credit amounts are shown.
Examples for Using T-Accounts
I regularly use T-accounts when preparing adjusting entries (accruals and deferrals). I begin by drawing two T-accounts, marking one as the balance sheet account, and one as the income statement account. I then enter the current balances. The next step is to determine the amount that should be the correct ending balance for the balance sheet account. The difference between the current balance and the needed ending balance is the amount for the adjusting entry.
As a young accountant I had to determine the effect of a new FASB standard on my employer's financial statements. I reported on the impact on the company's expenses in great detail. I thought I was done until the controller drew two T-accounts on a piece of paper and noted my comments in the expense T-account, and then asked, ""What about the other account? You told me about the expense account, but what other account or accounts are involved? You know we have double-entry accounting!"" Thanks to his two T-accounts, I have never forgotten to consider the full impact of business transactions.",what
Where do credit card payments get recorded?,"Definition of Credit Card Payments
We define a credit card payment as the amount a company remits to the credit card company for the purchases that occurred by using the credit card.
The company's payment to the credit card company will result in a credit to the company's Cash account. However, the debit portion of the payment entry depends on whether the individual credit card purchases had been previously recorded in the company's general ledger accounts.
Example of Recording Credit Card Payments
Assuming that the credit card purchases had not been previously entered into the accounts, there will be many debits in order to record each of the many credit card purchases/transactions into the company's appropriate general ledger account(s).
Assuming that the credit card purchases were recorded in the general ledger accounts prior to the company paying the credit card bill, the payment to the credit card company might be recorded with a credit to Cash and a single debit to Credit Card Payable (if that account was used when recording the credit card purchases).",what
What is a purchase discount?,"Definition of Purchase Discount
A purchase discount is a deduction that a company may receive if the supplier offers it and the company pays the supplier's invoice within a specified period of time. The purchase discount is also known as a cash discount or early-payment discount. (A supplier offering the discount will record the discounts taken by its customers in the account Sales Discounts.)
Purchase Discounts is also a general ledger account used by a company purchasing inventory goods and accounting for them under the periodic inventory system.
Example of Purchase Discount
Assume that a company receives a supplier's invoice of $5,000 with the credit terms 2/10 net 30. The company will be allowed to subtract a purchase discount of $100 (2% of $5,000) and remit $4,900 if the invoice is paid in 10 days. Otherwise, the company must pay the full $5,000 within 30 days.
If a company purchases office equipment for $20,000 and the invoice has credit terms of 1/10, net 30, the company can deduct $200 (1% of $20,000) and remit $19,800 if the invoice is paid within 10 days. If that occurs, the company will record the equipment at its cost of $19,800.",what
Where is accrued income reported in the balance sheet?,"Definition of Accrued Income
Accrued income refers to amounts that have been earned, but the amounts have not yet been received. For example, a corporation may have its excess cash invested in an investment security that pays interest every six months. Between the interest payment dates, the company will have:

Accrued interest income that is to be reported on the income statement
Accrued interest receivable that is to be reported on the balance sheet

Accrued Income Reported on the Balance Sheet
The amount of accrued income that a corporation has a right to receive as of the date of the balance sheet will be reported in the current asset section of the balance sheet. It could be described as accrued receivables or accrued income.
The amount of the accrued income reported on the income statement also causes an increase in a corporation's retained earnings, which is part of the stockholders' equity section of the balance sheet.
Balance Sheet: Retail/Wholesale - Corporation",what
What is the entry for a loan to an employee?,"Definition of Loan to Employee
A loan to an employee is money advanced by the company to assist the employee. If the employee is expected to repay the loan within one year of the balance sheet date, the loan balance is a current asset of the company. Any amount not expected to be collected within one year is a noncurrent or long term asset.
It is common for the loan to an employee to specify an interest rate and a schedule of payments.
Entry to Record a Loan to Employee
Assume that a company lends an employee $5,000 for a family emergency. The entry will debit Loan to Employee for $5,000 and will credit Cash for $5,000.
Under the accrual method of accounting, at each balance sheet date the company should record any accrued interest by debiting Interest Receivable and crediting Interest Income.
When the employee makes a payment, the company will debit Cash and will credit Interest Receivable and Loan to Employee for the appropriate amounts.",what
Where in the chart of accounts is a suspense account located?,"Suspense Account in the Chart of Accounts
A suspense account could be located in any one of these sections of an organization's chart of accounts:

Asset
Liability
Revenue
Expense

Examples of Suspense Accounts
Assume that a company receives cash of $500 but cannot readily determine the reason why it received the $500. Obviously, the company's asset Cash is to be debited, but the account to be credited (required by the double-entry system) for $500 is not known. The unknown account could be in any of the following sections of the chart of accounts:

Asset section if the cash was from the sale of another asset or the collection of an asset
Liability section if the cash was a deposit for future work to be done
Revenue section if the cash was for work that was recently earned, but not yet billed
Expense account if the cash was a refund of an earlier expense

Unfortunately, the best section may not be known at the time of the receipt, and it is hard to say where you will find the suspense account in your own chart of accounts and general ledger.",what
How do you record an asset that was partially financed?,"Example of Recording an Asset that was Partially Financed
Assume that your company purchased a car for $10,000 by paying cash of $4,000 and signing a promissory note for $6,000.
The accounting entry is:

Debit the asset account Automobiles for the cost of $10,000
Credit the asset account Cash for the $4,000 that was paid
Credit the liability account Notes Payable for $6,000

The liability account Notes Payable reports the principal amount owed at the time. Interest that will occur in the future is not recorded at the time of the purchase. The reason is that the interest is not owed as of that date.
Each month, one month's interest on the note or loan should be recorded with a debit to Interest Expense and a credit to Cash or Interest Payable (if the interest was not paid). Any cash payments that exceed the amount of interest owed at the time of the payment should be debited to Notes Payable. The balance in the liability account Notes Payable should agree with the principal balance owed to the lender. The balance in the liability account Interest Payable should agree with the interest due as of that date.
You can call the lender to verify the amount of principal and interest owed at a specific date and then compare the amounts to the balances in your general ledger accounts.",what
Why are assets and expenses increased with a debit?,"Let's use two transactions to illustrate why assets and expenses are increased with a debit: 1) A company pays $25,000 for a new delivery van, and 2) A company pays $800 for the current month's rent.
In both of the transactions the company pays cash at the time of the transaction. In each of the transactions the Cash account is credited. Therefore, each transaction will require a debit to another account. (Recall that double-entry bookkeeping requires at least one debit and one credit when recording a transaction.)
In the first transaction, the debit will be to a long term asset account such as Delivery Vehicles. In this transaction the asset Delivery Vehicles was increased with a debit and the asset Cash was decreased with a credit. The accounting equation (A=L+OE) remains in balance because one asset increased by $25,000 and one asset decreased by $25,000.
In the second transaction, the debit will be to Rent Expense since the amount will be used up in the current accounting period. (If the amount was a prepayment of a future period's rent, the amount would have been debited to the asset account Prepaid Rent.) Since Rent Expense reduces net income, it  also reduces owner's or stockholders' equity, which normally have credit balances. The accounting equation will show assets decreasing by the reduction in cash and owner's or stockholders' equity decreasing because of the expense.
The asset Delivery Vehicle is an asset, but will become Depreciation Expense over the life of the vehicle. The rent is an immediate expense because there is no future accounting period benefiting from the current month's rent.",what
What is the difference between revenues and receipts?,"Definition of Revenues
A company's revenues are amounts it has earned as the result of business activities such as selling merchandise or performing services. Under the accrual method of accounting, revenues are reported on the income statement in the period in which they are earned even though the dependable customers will pay the company 30 days later.
Example of Revenues
On June 10, a company sells $4,000 of goods to one of its best customers with credit terms of net 30 days. On June 10, the company has revenues of $4,000 which will be recorded with a debit of $4,000 to Accounts Receivable and a credit of $4,000 to Sales Revenues. 
Definition of Receipts
A company's receipts  refers to the cash that the company received.
Examples of Receipts
The following are some examples of receipts which are not revenues:

Borrowing $1,000 in cash from the bank
Collecting $4,000 from a sale that was recorded one month earlier
Disposing of a company vehicle and receiving cash that is equal to the vehicle's book value
Receiving $1,000 from an employee who had borrowed $1,000 from the company several weeks earlier
Receiving cash from an investor for new shares of the company's common stock

Example of Both a Revenue and a Receipt
When a company makes a $200 cash sale (or performs services for $200 of cash) the company has earned revenue of $200 and has a receipt of $200.",what
What is the difference between entries in a general journal versus a general ledger?,"Definition of General Journal
The general journal is described as the book of original entry. Today the general journal is used to record adjusting entries and transactions other than payments, receipts, or payroll. An entry in the general journal will include the date, the account with the amount that is to be debited, the account with the amount that is to be credited, and a brief description. After these relatively few transactions are recorded in the general journal, the amounts will be posted to the accounts indicated.
Definition of General Ledger
The general ledger contains the accounts used by the company to sort and store the amounts from all of the company's transactions (including all of the payments, receipts, payroll, and general journal entries). These accounts are known as general ledger accounts. The amounts and balances in the general ledger accounts are used to prepare the company's financial statements. 
Example of General Journal and General Ledger
Assume that a company depreciates its equipment at a rate of $10,000 per year.
In the general journal the company enters the following information:

December 31 (and the year)
Depreciation Expense $10,000 (in the debit column)
Accumulated Depreciation $10,000 (in the credit column)
A short explanation such as ""Depreciation for the Year""

Next, the amounts in the general journal must be posted to the specified accounts in the general ledger. In our example, the account Depreciation Expense will be debited as of December 31 for $10,000 and the account Accumulated Depreciation will be credited as of December 31 for $10,000.",what
Is advertising an asset or an expense?,"Definition of Advertising Expense
Advertising is the amount a company incurs to promote its products, brands, and image via television, radio, magazines, Internet, etc. Since the accountants cannot measure the future benefit of the advertising, the advertising costs must be reported as Advertising Expense at the time the ads are run.
A prepayment of the cost of ads that will air in the future should be recorded in a current asset account such as Prepaid Advertising. When the ad is aired, the amount must be transferred from Prepaid Advertising to Advertising Expense.
Example of Advertising as an Asset and as an Expense
Let's assume that in December a corporation paid $15 million to prepare an ad and to book a time for it to be shown during the Super Bowl Game in early February. Until February, the $15 million is the current asset Prepaid Advertising. After the ad is shown in the Super Bowl Game, the corporation must credit Prepaid Advertising and debit Advertising Expense. This is necessary because the accountants cannot measure the sales (if any) that will occur because of the Super Bowl ad.",what
What are debits and credits?,"Definition of Debits and Credits
Debits and credits are terms used in accounting and bookkeeping systems for the past five centuries. They are part of the double entry system which results in every business transaction affecting at least two accounts. At least one of the accounts will receive a debit entry and at least one other account will receive a credit entry. Further, the amounts entered as debits must be equal to the amounts entered as credits.
You should think of a debit as an entry on the left side of an account, and a credit as an entry on the right side of another account. Accountants often use T-accounts to visualize the debit and credit effects on the accounts' balances.
It may take some time to learn which general ledger accounts will be debited and credited, but here are some general rules:

Expense accounts generally have debit entries and have debit balances
Revenue accounts generally have credit entries and have credit balances
Assets generally have both debit and credit entries, but usually have debit balances
Liabilities generally have debit and credit entries, but usually have credit balances
Stockholders' equity accounts could have debit and credit entries, but profitable corporations usually have credit balances

Examples of Debits and Credits
To illustrate, let's assume that a company borrows $10,000 from its bank. The company will enter $10,000 as a debit in its Cash account and a credit of $10,000 in its Notes Payable account.
If the company pays $300 for an ad to air on the radio, the company will enter $300 as a debit in the Advertising Expense account and will enter $300 as a credit in its Cash account.",what
Why would a balance sheet list current liabilities as negative amounts?,"Reasons for Negative Current Liabilities on a Balance Sheet
Some older accounting software used minus signs or parentheses to indicate credit balances, while positive numbers indicated debit balances. The accounting software usually had an option to print the liability account balances on the balance sheet without the negative signs.
If only one liability account has a negative sign, it is likely that the liability account has a debit balance instead of the normal credit balance. This would be the case if a company remitted more than the amount needed. 
During the first few days of the accounting period in which reversing entries are recorded to reverse the accrual adjusting entries for expenses and liabilities of the previous period, the current liability accounts will show debit balances. However, that is a temporary situation until the actual bills are processed.",what
Are sales discounts reported as an expense?,"Definition of Sales Discounts
Sales discounts are also known as cash discounts or early payment discounts. Sales discounts (along with sales returns and allowances) are deducted from gross sales to arrive at the company's net sales. Hence, the general ledger account Sales Discounts is a contra revenue account. Sales discounts are not reported as an expense.
Example of Sales Discounts
A company offers its business customer sales discounts of 1/10, net 30. For the recent year, the company had gross sales of $510,000 and had sales discounts of $4,000 and sales returns and allowance of $5,000. As a result, the company reported net sales of $501,000.",what
Does sales commission get reported in the income statement?,"Sales commissions earned by a company would be reported as revenue in the company's income statement. Sales commissions that a company must pay to others are reported as an expense.
Under the accrual basis of accounting (as opposed to the cash basis) commission revenues should be reported when the company earns the commissions. The commission expense should be reported when the company has incurred the expense and liability. (This would also be the time when the other party has earned the commissions and the right to receive them.)
The commission revenues would be reported as operating revenue (in the section where sales are reported), if the commissions are earned as a main activity of the company. If the commissions are incidental or involve a peripheral activity, these commission revenues would be reported as other income.
Commission expense would be reported as a selling expense along with other operating expenses when they are related to the company's main activities. If a commission expense pertains to a peripheral activity, it would be reported as other expense.",what
What is the accounting entry to close the sole proprietorship drawing account?,"Definition of Sole Proprietorship Drawing Account
The drawing or withdrawal account for a sole proprietorship is a temporary owner equity's account that is closed at the end of the accounting year. The drawing account is also a contra account to owner's equity, because the drawing account's debit balance is contrary to the normal credit balance for an owner's equity account.
At the end of the accounting year, the drawing account is closed directly to the capital account with an entry that debits the owner's capital account and credits the owner's drawing account. Please note that the owner's drawing account is not an expense and as a result it does not get closed to the Income Summary account nor will the amount appear on the company's income statement.
Example of the Entry to Close the Drawing Account
Let's assume that at the end of the accounting year the account Eve Jones, Drawing has a debit balance of $24,000. This balance is the result of Eve withdrawing $2,000 per month from her sole proprietorship for her personal use. (The monthly withdrawals were recorded with a debit to Eve Jones, Drawing and a credit to Cash.) The journal entry to close the drawing account at the end of the accounting year will credit Eve Jones, Drawing for $24,000 and will debit Eve Jones, Capital for $24,000.",what
What is accrued rent?,"Definition of Accrued Rent
Accrued rent is the amount of rent that has not yet been paid by the tenant or received by the landlord for a past period of time. [If the tenant always pays the monthly rent on the first day of every, there will never be any accrued rent.] 
Under the accrual method of accounting the tenant should report:

Rent Expense during the period of time that the space was occupied but was not paid, and
A current liability Rent Payable for the amount owed to the landlord at each balance sheet date

Under the accrual method of accounting and assuming that the amount will be collected, the landlord should report:

Rent Revenue (or Rental Income) during the period of time that the space was occupied but the rent was not received from the tenant, and
A current asset Rent Receivable for the amount owed by the tenant at each balance sheet date

Example of Accrued Rent
A landlord and tenant agree to a monthly rent of $1,000 for office space beginning on October 1. Each month's rent is to be paid on the first day of the month. The tenant paid the monthly rent on October 1 and November 1, but asked the landlord if the December rent could be paid on February 1 (when the tenant will be receiving a large payment from a client). The landlord is assured that all rent due will be paid by February 1. Assuming that the tenant and the landlord use the accrual method of accounting, the following accrual adjusting entries are needed prior to issuing the December 31 financial statements:

The tenant will debit Rent Expense for $1,000 and will credit Rent Payable for $1,000
The landlord will debit Rent Receivable for $1,000 and will credit Rent Revenues for $1,000",what
What is a/c?,"Definition of a/c
In accounting, a/c is the abbreviation for account.
Example of a/c
An accountant might leave the following note for a subordinate:
""Please review the balance in the a/c Interest Payable.""",what
What is the difference between adjusting entries and correcting entries?,"Definition of Adjusting Entries
Generally, adjusting entries are required at the end of every accounting period so that a company's financial statements reflect the accrual method of accounting.
Adjusting entries involve at least one income statement account and at least one balance sheet account.
Examples of Adjusting Entries
The following are some examples of the need for adjusting entries:

To report expenses and losses along with the related liabilities for transactions that have occurred but are not yet recorded in the general ledger accounts
To report revenues and gains along with the related assets for transactions that have occurred but are not yet recorded in the general ledger accounts
To defer future expenses and the related assets that were included in a previously recorded transaction
To defer future revenues and the related liabilities that were included in a previously recorded transaction
To record depreciation expense and/or bad debts expense and the change in the related contra asset account

Definition of Correcting Entries
Correcting entries are journal entries made to correct an error in a previously recorded transaction. Correcting entries can involve any combination of income statement accounts and balance sheet accounts.
Examples of Correcting Entries
The following are two examples of the need for correcting entries:

To correct an erroneous amount used when recording a previous transaction
To move an amount from an incorrect account (that was used when recording a previous transaction) to the correct account",what
What are the accounting entries for a fully depreciated car?,"Definition of a Fully Depreciated Car
A fully depreciated car is one where the car's historical cost has already been allocated to expense (except for the estimated salvage value, if any).
Accounting Entries for a Fully Depreciated Car
If the fully depreciated car continues to be used, there will be no further depreciation. The company cannot depreciate more than the car's cost. 
If the fully depreciated car is sold or scrapped, the following accounting entry is needed:

Debit to Cash for the amount received
Debit Accumulated Depreciation for the car's accumulated depreciation
Credit  the asset account containing the car's cost
Credit the account Gain on Sale of Vehicles for the amount necessary to have the total of the debit amounts equal to the total of the credit amounts",what
What does understated mean?,"When an accountant says that an amount is understated, it means two things:

The amount is not the correct amount, and
The amount is less than the true amount.  In other words, the amount is too small.

To illustrate the term understated, let's assume that a company is reporting its accounts payable as $21,000. Let's also assume that the correct or true amount of accounts payable is $23,000. An accountant will say that the reported amount of $21,000 is understated by $2,000.
Because of double-entry bookkeeping or accounting there will also be a second general ledger account with an error for the same amount.",what
Why is Rent Expense a debit and Service Revenues a credit?,"Why Rent Expense is a Debit
Rent expense (and any other expense) will reduce a company's owner's equity (or stockholders' equity). Owner's equity which is on the right side of the accounting equation is expected to have a credit balance. Therefore, to reduce the credit balance, the expense accounts will require debit entries.
Example of Rent Expense as a Debit
If a company pays $800 for the current month's rent, the company's assets and its owner's equity will decrease. To decrease an asset such as Cash, the company will credit the Cash account for $800. Since every entry must have debits equal to credits, the company will need to debit another account for $800. In this case, the account is Rent Expense. (Eventually the debit balance in the Rent Expense account will be transferred/closed to the proprietor's capital account or to a corporation's retained earnings account.)
Why Service Revenues is a Credit
Service revenues (and any other revenues) will increase a company's owner's equity (or stockholders' equity). Owner's equity which is on the right side of the accounting equation is expected to have a credit balance. Therefore, to increase the credit balance, the revenues accounts will have to be credited.
Example of Service Revenues as a Credit
If the company earns and receives $300 for providing a service, the company's assets and owner's equity will increase. The asset Cash will be increased with a debit of $300. Therefore, another account will need to be credited. In this case Service Revenues will be credited for $300. Service Revenues is a temporary account that will eventually be closed to the owner's equity account.",what
How can working capital be improved?,"Definition of Working Capital
Working capital is defined as the amount by which a company's current assets exceed its current liabilities.
How Working Capital Can be Improved
Some of the ways that working capital can be increased include:

Earning additional profits
Issuing common stock or preferred stock for cash
Borrowing money on a long-term basis
Replacing short-term debt with long-term debt
Selling long-term assets for cash

In addition to increasing working capital, a company can improve its working capital by making certain that its current assets are converted to cash in a timely manner. For example, if a company can better manage its inventory and its accounts receivable, the company's cash and liquidity will increase. This in turn improves the company's working capital. Similarly, if the company can negotiate more favorable credit terms with its suppliers, the company will have the benefit of having a larger cash balance (even though the amount of working capital will not change).",what
What is a memorandum entry?,"Definition of Memorandum Entry
A memorandum entry is a short message entered into the general journal and also entered into a general ledger account. It is not a complete journal entry because it does not contain debit and credit amounts.
Example of Memorandum Entry
The following entry for a stock split is an example of a memorandum entry:
""On June 7, 2019 a 2-for-1 stock split was declared for the common stockholders of record as of the end of the day on June 28, 2019. The stock split will result in the number of issued and outstanding shares of common shares increasing from 200,000 shares to 400,000 shares.""
Since a stock split does not change the balance in the Common Stock account, a complete journal entry was not required. The memorandum entry merely notes for future reference that the number of shares of stock has changed.",what
What are sales?,"In accounting, sales refers to the revenues earned when a company sells its goods, products, merchandise, etc. (If a company sells one of its noncurrent assets that was used in its business, the amount received is not recorded in its Sales account.)
The amounts recorded at the time of the sales transaction is also known as gross sales since there may be subsequent subtractions for sales returns, sales allowances, and early payment discounts. (Gross sales minus these subtractions results in the amount of net sales.)
Under the accrual basis or accrual method of accounting, goods sold on credit are reported as sales (revenue) when the goods have been transferred to the buyer. Usually this occurs before the seller receives payment from the buyer. The sales on credit are recorded with a debit to Accounts Receivable and a credit to Sales.",what
What is a credit?,"In bookkeeping and accounting, a credit could refer to the entry on the right side of a T-account. A credit could also be a verb that means the act of recording an amount on the right side of a T-account.
A credit entry in an asset account will reduce the account's usual debit entry.  A credit entry in a revenue, liability, or owner's equity account will increase the usual credit balance.
A credit could also mean your bank has increased your bank account balance. Your bank account is a liability for your bank and when your bank account increases, your bank has a larger obligation to you.
Credit can also refer to loans, such as line of credit, letter of credit, credit rating, as so on.",what
Why isn't land depreciated?,"Land is not depreciated because land is assumed to have an unlimited useful life.
Other long-lived assets such as land improvements, buildings, furnishings, equipment, etc. have limited useful lives. Therefore, the costs of those assets must be allocated to those limited accounting periods. Since land's life is not limited, there is no need to allocate the cost of land to any accounting periods.",what
What is a contra liability account?,"A contra liability account is a liability account where the balance is expected to be a debit balance. Since a debit balance in a liability account is contrary to the normal credit balance, the account is referred to as a contra liability account.
The most common contra liability accounts are Discount on Bonds Payable, Bond Issue Costs, Debt Issue Costs, and Discount on Notes Payable. The debit balances in these accounts are amortized or allocated to Interest Expense over the life of the bonds or notes.
The credit balance in the liability account Bonds Payable minus the debit balances in the contra liability accounts Discount on Bonds Payable and Bond Issue Costs is the carrying value or book value of the bonds. The credit balance in Notes Payable minus the debit balances in Discount on Notes Payable and Debt Issue Costs is the carrying value or book value of the notes payable.",what
What is double-entry bookkeeping?,"Definition of Double-Entry Bookkeeping
Double-entry bookkeeping refers to the 500-year-old system in which each financial transaction of a company is recorded with an entry into at least two of its general ledger accounts.
At least one account will have an amount entered as a debit and at least one account will have an amount entered as a credit. Further, the total amounts entered as debits must be equal to the total amounts entered as credits. Meeting these requirements will result in the accounting or bookkeeping equation being in balance at all times.
Examples of Double-Entry Bookkeeping
Let's assume that a company borrows $10,000 from its bank. The company's asset account Cash is increased with a debit entry of $10,000 and the company's liability account Loans Payable is increased with a credit entry of $10,000. If the company repays $3,000 of the amount borrowed, the company will decrease the amount in its Cash account with a credit entry of $3,000 and will reduce the balance in its Loan Payable account with a debit entry of $3,000.
If the company pays its monthly rent of $2,000, a credit entry of $2,000 will be recorded in its Cash account and a $2,000 debit entry will be recorded in its Rent Expense account.
If a company collects $500 from a customer who had previously purchased goods on credit, the company will make a debit entry of $500 in its Cash account and will make a credit entry of $500 in its asset account Accounts Receivable.",what
What is a post-dated check?,"Definition of a Post-dated Check
A post-dated check (or post-dated cheque) is a check written with a future date. In other words, the date that appears on the check is after the date when the check was written. Even with a future date appearing on the check, the check could clear (be paid from) the bank account prior to that date.
Post-dating a check makes sense only if you are certain that the payee will not cash or deposit the check before the date appearing on the check.
Example of a Post-dated Check
To illustrate, let's assume that on May 22 Jim owes a supplier $2,000 for purchases made 40 days ago. Since Jim does not have the money to pay the supplier, he offers to mail the supplier two $1,000 checks: one check dated for June 20 and the other check dated for July 20. 
The supplier agrees to hold the checks and deposit them on the dates shown on the checks. Jim assures the supplier that the checks will be paid by his bank on those dates.
On June 4, when the supplier receives Jim's postdated checks, the supplier should not debit cash nor credit accounts receivable. The reason is that the checks cannot be turned into cash prior to the dates shown on the checks.",what
What are some tips to make learning debits and credits easy?,"Here are five tips to make learning debits and credits easier:

The accounts for expenses are nearly always debited. For example, when a company pays its monthly rent, it debits Rent Expense. If it runs an ad on the radio, it will debit Advertising Expense.
The accounts for revenues are almost always credited. When a bakery sells its products, it credits Sales. When a bank earns interest on its loans, it credits Loan Interest Revenues.
When a company issues a check, it credits the asset account Cash.
When a company receives money, it debits Cash.
Every transaction will require a debit to at least one account and a credit to at least one other account.

Here are two examples to illustrate our five tips. 

A bakery records its cash sales at a local market with a debit to Cash and a credit to Sales.
A company records its $400 payment to repair its delivery van with a debit to Vehicle Repair Expense and a credit to Cash.",what
How does the accounting equation stay in balance when the monthly rent is paid?,"How a Rent Payment Affects the Accounting Equation
A company's payment of each month's rent reduces the company's asset Cash. This is recorded with a credit to Cash.
If the payment is for the current month's rent, the second account is to the temporary account Rent Expense which will be debited. The debit to Rent Expense also causes owner's equity (or stockholders' equity) to decrease. Eventually, the balances in the company's temporary accounts will actually be transferred/closed to the owner's capital account (or to a corporation's retained earnings account within stockholders' equity).
To recap the above, the monthly rent payment keeps the sole proprietor's accounting equation, Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity, in balance because it reduces the company's assets and it reduces the company's owner's equity.",what
What is a recurring journal entry?,"A recurring journal entry is a journal entry that is recorded in every accounting period. For example, a company issuing monthly financial statements might record depreciation by debiting Depreciation Expense for $3,000 and crediting Accumulated Depreciation for $3,000 each and every month. If the accounts and the amounts are identical each month, the recurring journal entry might be referred to as a memorized entry if the accounting software produces and records the entry. Some accountants refer to this type of recurring journal entry as a standard journal entry.
The term recurring journal entry can also refer to monthly journal entries where the accounts are identical but the amounts vary by month. For example, the journal entry to record property insurance expense might involve Insurance Expense and Prepaid Insurance every month, but the amounts will change when the amount of the prepaid insurance premiums change. Other recurring entries will involve the identical accounts, but the amounts will be different in each accounting period. An example is the payroll entry. Each payroll entry will have the same accounts but different amounts due to the number of hours worked. Other examples of recurring entries with amounts that differ each period include sales, interest earned, interest expense, bank service charges, and so on.
One company's recurring entry with differing amounts is generated by its software. Each month its computer system debits Freight Expense and credits a liability Accrued Freight  for the pounds shipped multiplied by a freight cost per pound. When the freight bills are received and paid, the liability and its cash are reduced. As long as its cost per pound is accurate, the company's computer system is routinely achieving the matching principle and the accrual method of accounting with little professional effort.
Keep in mind that accountants may have different definitions of recurring journal entries.",what
Is an entry made for outstanding checks when preparing a bank reconciliation?,"No entry is made to a company's general ledger for outstanding checks when preparing a bank reconciliation. The reason is outstanding checks are an adjustment to the bank balance. Outstanding checks are not an adjustment to the company's Cash account in its general ledger.
However, if a company voids one of its outstanding checks, the company will need to make an entry to its general ledger. The entry will debit Cash in order to increase the account balance. The credit portion of the entry will likely be to the account that was originally debited when the check was issued.",what
A credit is not a normal balance for what accounts?,"A credit is not a normal balance for asset accounts, the purchase account under the periodic inventory system, expense accounts, and the owner's drawing account.
Exceptions to this list would be contra accounts such as Allowance for Doubtful Accounts (a contra account to the asset Accounts Receivable) and Accumulated Depreciation (a contra account to depreciable assets). In other words, credit balances are expected for contra asset accounts. Purchase Discounts and Purchase Returns and Allowances (which are contra accounts to Purchases) are expected to have credit balances.
A general rule is that asset accounts will normally have debit balances. Liability and stockholders' equity accounts will normally have credit balances. Revenue accounts will have credit balances (since revenues will increase stockholders' or owner's equity). Expense accounts will normally have debit balances as they cause stockholders' and owner's equity to decrease.",what
What is an invoice?,"An invoice is defined in a Webster's dictionary as ""an itemized bill for goods sold or services provided, containing individual prices, the total charge, and the terms.""
The invoice is often referred to as the sales invoice. However, the purchaser of the goods or services might refer to the invoice received from the vendor or supplier as a purchase invoice.",what
Will every transaction affect an income statement account and a balance sheet account?,"No. Some transactions affect only balance sheet accounts. For example, when a company pays a supplier for goods previously purchased with terms of net 30 days, the payment will be recorded as a debit to the liability account  Accounts Payable  and as a credit to the asset account Cash. (No revenue account or expense account is involved.)
Another example of a transaction affecting two balance sheet accounts and no income statement account is a deposit for future services. The payer will debit the asset Prepaid Expenses and will credit the asset Cash. The company receiving the payment will debit Cash and will credit a liability account such as Customer Deposits, Unearned Revenues or Deferred Revenues.
Adjusting entries are a classification of accounting entries that will affect a balance sheet account and an income statement account.",what
"In accounting, what is the meaning of dr.?","In accounting, dr. is the abbreviation for the word debit. (Today, accountants and bookkeepers use the term debit, but five centuries ago in Italy, the term included the letter ""r"".)
In accounting and bookkeeping, debit or dr. indicates an entry on the left side of a general ledger account. Typically, the accounts for assets and expenses will have debit balances. Debit entries will also reduce the credit balances typically found in the liability and stockholders' equity accounts.",what
What is the accounting entry when an order is received?,"There is no accounting entry recorded in a company's general ledger accounts when an order is received.
The reason is that a sale or sales revenues has not yet occurred, nor does the company have an accounts receivable at this point. Generally, the sale and the related receivable occur when the goods are shipped (FOB shipping point) or when the goods are received by the customer (FOB destination).
While there is no accounting entry in the general ledger, it is likely that the company will create a record outside of the general ledger to track the order and to schedule various activities that will be needed to ship the products to the customer.",what
What is the abbreviation for debit and credit?,"Abbreviation for Debit and Credit
The abbreviation for debit is dr. and the abbreviation for credit is cr.
Apparently the ""dr."" is associated with the term used in Italy more than 500 years ago, rather than the word ""debit"" which we use today.",what
Can you help me understand the golden rules of accounting?,"The golden rules of accounting are not presented in any of the U.S. accounting books that I have reviewed. I assume the reason for omitting the golden rules of accounting is that short phrases such as ""debit the receiver"" or ""credit what goes out"" or ""personal accounts"" are inadequate and not helpful to people such as yourself.

Why are sales a credit?,"The account Sales is credited because a corporation's sales of products will cause its stockholders' equity to increase. A sole proprietorship's sales will cause the owner's equity to increase.
The Sales account is used in order to keep a tally of the sales made during an accounting year. However, when the accounting year is completed, the credit balance will be moved via closing entries to the corporation's Retained Earnings account or to the sole proprietorship's Owner's Capital account.
Recall that asset accounts will likely have debit balances and the liability and stockholders' equity accounts will likely have credit balances. To confirm that crediting the Sales account is logical, think of a cash sale. The asset account Cash is debited and therefore the Sales account will have to be credited. Also the accounting equation will remain in balance because the asset Cash is increased with a debit, and through the closing entries an owner's or stockholders' equity account will be increased with a credit.",what
How do I record money received for an insurance claim on inventory loss?,"The money received from an insurance company for a claim involving a loss on inventory stock is debited to Cash. Any other proceeds from disposing of the inventory items will also be debited to Cash.
In addition, the Inventory account is credited for the carrying cost of the inventory items, which is usually the original cost of the items. If the total of the debits to Cash is greater than the credits to Inventory, the difference is credited to a gain account, such as Gain from Inventory Damage. If the total of the debits to Cash is less than the credits to Inventory, the difference is a debit to a loss account, such as Loss from Inventory Damage.",what
What does double entry mean?,"Double entry means that every transaction will involve at least two accounts. For example, if your company borrows money from the bank, the company's asset Cash is increased and the company's liability Notes Payable is increased. If your company pays the six-month insurance premium, your company's asset Cash is decreased and its asset Prepaid Insurance is increased. If an employee works for hourly wages, the company's account Wages Expense is increased and its liability account Wages Payable is increased. When the employee is paid, the account Wages Payable is decreased and Cash is decreased.
Double entry also requires that one account be debited and the other account be credited. Accounting software might record the effect on one account automatically and only require information on the other account. For example, if you are preparing a check, the software will automatically reduce the Cash account. Therefore, the accounting software needs only to prompt you for information on the other account involved in the payment being processed.",what
When are expenses credited?,"While general ledger expense accounts are typically debited and have debit balances, there are times when the expense accounts are credited.
Some instances when general ledger expense accounts are credited include:

the end-of-year closing entries
the reversing entry for a previous accrual adjusting entry involving an expense
an adjusting entry to defer part of a prepayment that was debited to an expense account
a correcting entry to reclassify an amount from the incorrect expense account to the correct account",what
What is the entry for the down payment from a signed contract?,"A down payment received before it is earned is recorded with a debit to the current asset account Cash and a credit to the current liability account Customer Deposits.
When the contract is completed, the account Customer Deposits will be debited for the amount of the down payment, the sale will be recorded with a credit, and Cash or Accounts Receivable will be debited.",what
What does it mean to reclassify an amount?,"To reclassify an amount often means to move an amount from one general ledger account to another general ledger account.
To illustrate, let's assume that an invoice for $900 was recorded in the account Advertising Expenses. Upon review, the advertising manager informs the accountant that the amount should have been recorded in the account Marketing Supplies. If the accountant uses a journal entry to move the amount, the entry's description might be: To reclassify $900 from Advertising Expense to Marketing Supplies.
In this illustration, the phrase to reclassify an amount has a gentler tone than the phrase to correct an account coding error.",what
What is a deferred credit?,"A deferred credit could mean money received in advance of it being earned, such as deferred revenue, unearned revenue, or customer advances. A deferred credit could also result from complicated transactions where a credit amount arises, but the amount is not revenue.
A deferred credit is reported as a liability on the balance sheet. Depending on the specifics, the deferred credit might be a current liability or a noncurrent liability. In the past, it was common to see a noncurrent liability section with the heading Deferred Credits.",what
What is the entry when a company lends money to an employee?,"When a company lends cash to one of its employees, the entry will include a credit to Cash and a debit to an asset account such as Notes Receivable from Employees (if a promissory note is involved) or Other Receivables-Advances to Employees (if a note is not involved).
When the company earns interest on the loan, the interest should be credited to Interest Revenue or Interest Income and should be debited to Interest Receivable or Cash.",what
How do I start a petty cash fund?,"To start a petty cash fund you need to open a general ledger account entitled Petty Cash. This will be an additional cash account that you could report either separately or have its balance included with other cash accounts when preparing a balance sheet.
Next you need to write a check for the amount that you believe is the amount needed for making small payments in your office. Let's assume that the amount will be $100. When processing the check you would indicate the account code for Petty Cash, so that the new account will be debited for $100.
You also need to designate one person to be the petty cash custodian. This person's name will be the payee of the $100 check. This person will then be accountable for the $100. At all times the custodian must have a combination of cash and petty cash receipts which add up to $100.
Just prior to issuing financial statements, the petty cash custodian should request cash for the petty cash receipts. This is known as replenishing the petty cash fund. This allows for the expenses to be included in the income statement and will result in the custodian having the $100 of cash that will be reported in the balance sheet. The custodian can also replenish the petty cash fund when there is little cash on hand due to a large amount of petty cash payments.",what
How do you record a deposit on utilities?,"A deposit on utilities is recorded with a debit to the asset account Utilities Deposit and a credit to the asset account Cash. The account Utilities Deposit will be reported as a current asset if the company expects the amount to be returned by the utilities within one year of the balance sheet date. If the deposit will not be returned within one year of the balance sheet date, it will be reported as a long-term asset.",what
"In accounting, what is the meaning of cr.?","In accounting, cr. is the abbreviation for credit.
In accounting and in bookkeeping, credit or cr. indicates an entry on the right side of a general ledger account.

"Is contributed capital a noncurrent asset or a current asset, and is it a debit or credit?","The account Contributed Capital is part of stockholders' equity and it will have a credit balance. Contributed capital is also referred to as paid-in capital.
When a corporation issues shares of its stock for cash, the corporation's current asset Cash will increase with the debit part of the entry, and the account Contributed Capital will increase with the credit part of the entry. If the corporation then uses some of its cash to purchase equipment, its current asset Cash will decrease and its noncurrent asset Equipment will increase.
If a corporation receives equipment in exchange for newly issued shares of stock, the noncurrent asset Equipment will increase and Contributed Capital will increase.",what
What is an asset account?,"Definition of an Asset Account
An asset account is a general ledger account used to sort and store the debit and credit amounts from a company's transactions involving the company's resources.
The balances in the asset accounts will be summarized and reported on the company's balance sheet.
Generally, the asset account balances are debit balances and are increased with a debit entry and decreased with a credit entry.
Examples of Asset Accounts
Some examples of asset accounts include Cash, Accounts Receivable, Inventory, Prepaid Expenses, Investments, Buildings, Equipment, Vehicles, Goodwill, and many more.
Two asset accounts, Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Accumulated Depreciation, are known as contra asset accounts since these accounts are expected to have credit balances.
Asset Accounts Are Permanent or Real Accounts
Asset accounts are referred to as permanent or real accounts since they are not closed at the end of the accounting year. Instead, each asset account's balance at the end of the accounting year is carried forward to become the beginning balance of the next accounting year.",what
What are the stockholders' equity accounts?,"The stockholders' equity accounts are balance sheet accounts and a part of the accounting equation Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders' Equity. In this light you can view the stockholders' equity accounts (along with the liability accounts) as sources of the amounts reported in the asset accounts.
If the source of an asset was an investor purchasing new shares of common stock, the corporation would credit the stockholders' equity account Common Stock and perhaps Paid-in Capital in Excess of Par—Common Stock, or Premium on Common Stock. If the source of an asset was an investor purchasing new shares of preferred stock, the corporation would credit the stockholders' equity account Preferred Stock and perhaps Paid-in Capital in Excess of Par—Preferred Stock, or Premium on Preferred Stock.
If the source of an asset was the net income earned by the corporation, the stockholders' equity account Retained Earnings would be credited. If a corporation reduces its assets by purchasing its stock from its stockholders, the contra-stockholders' equity account Treasury Stock is debited.",what
What are wages payable?,"Definition of Wages Payable
Wages payable refers to the wages that a company's employees have earned, but have not yet been paid. Under the accrual method of accounting, this amount is likely recorded with an adjusting entry at the end of the accounting period so that the company's balance sheet will include the amount as a current liability. (The adjusting entry typically debits Wages Expense and credits Wages Payable.)
Example of Wages Payable
To illustrate wages payable we will use the following hypothetical dates and other information. Jane is an hourly-paid sales clerk at a company that ends its accounting year on December 31. During the work week of Sunday December 22 through Saturday December 28 Jane earned $400 of wages that the company will pay to her on January 2. For the last three days of the year (December 29-31) Jane earned $160. This amount (plus any wages she earns from January 1-4) will be included in her January 9 paycheck.
Given this information, the company has wages payable of $560 ($400 + $160) as of December 31.
Reporting Wages Payable on the Balance Sheet
The company's current liabilities on its December 31 balance sheet must include the $560 of wages payable that Jane had earned and the company owes as of December 31. (The company's income statement for the year that ends on December 31 must also report the $560 as part of its wages expense.)
The amount in the account Wages Payable (or Accrued Wages Payable) will often be reported on the balance sheet as part of a current liability description such as accrued compensation, accrued payroll liabilities, accrued expenses, accrued liabilities, etc.",what
What is the chart of accounts?,"The chart of accounts is a listing of the general ledger accounts to which amounts can be posted. The chart of accounts is a helpful tool for identifying the best account for recording a transaction.
In some accounting software the chart of accounts may be the means to open new general ledger accounts and to control their position in the financial statements.
Usually the chart of accounts begins with the balance sheet accounts followed by the income statement accounts. The accounts will usually be in the same order as they are presented on the two financial statements.",what
Where do I record the refund of a registration fee?,"If the registration fee refers to a fee expense that you had originally paid but the amount is now being refunded to you, I would credit the same expense account that you had originally charged or debited, and would debit Cash.
If the registration fee refers to an amount you are refunding because someone had originally registered for one of your programs, I would 1) credit Cash for the amount you are paying out as the refund, and 2) debit a contra-revenue account such as Refunds of Registration Fee Revenues. This will allow you to easily track the total amounts of refunds that you make during a year. On the other hand, if it is rare for your organization to refund registration fees, you could simply 1) debit the amount you are refunding to the normal revenue account such as Registration Fee Revenues, and 2) credit Cash.",what
What is a special journal?,"Definition of a Special Journal
A special journal (also known as a specialized journal) is useful in a manual accounting or bookkeeping system to reduce the tedious task of recording both the debit and credit general ledger account names and amounts in a general journal.
Example of a Special Journal
One example of a special journal is the sales journal which is used exclusively for a company’s sales of merchandise to customers that are allowed to pay at a future date. The sales journal will have only one column in which to enter the amount of each sales invoice. At the end of the month the total of the column is debited to Accounts Receivable and credited to Sales. Throughout the month, the individual sales invoices will be posted to each customer’s record found in the company’s subsidiary ledger for Accounts Receivable. 
The benefits of using a special journal instead of the general journal for the repetitive transactions have been eliminated with today’s inexpensive yet powerful accounting software. For example, when a sales invoice is prepared by using accounting software, both the general ledger and subsidiary accounts will be updated instantly and accurately.
More Examples of Special Journals
In addition to the sales journal (used for recording sales on credit), there are other special journals which were popular in manual accounting systems. The following special journals were more efficient than recording all transactions in the general journal:

Cash disbursement journal for recording checks written.
Cash receipts journal for recording cash sales and other money received.
Purchases journal for recording purchases on credit of goods to be resold. (Cash purchases are recorded in the cash disbursement journal. Purchases of items such as equipment are recorded in the general journal.)",what
Why will some asset accounts have a credit balance?,"A few asset accounts intentionally have credit balances. For instance, the account Accumulated Depreciation (which is a plant asset account) will have a credit balance since it is credited for the amounts that are debited to Depreciation Expense. The account Allowance for Bad Debts will have a credit balance for the amounts in Accounts Receivable that are not likely to be collected. The accounts Accumulated Depreciation and Allowance for Bad Debts are referred to as contra asset accounts because their credit balances are contrary to the expected debit balances found in most asset accounts.
There are also unexpected situations that result in asset accounts having credit balances. Here are five examples:

An error caused by posting an amount to an incorrect account.
Continuing to depreciate or amortize an asset after its balance has reached zero.
Receiving and posting an amount that was greater than the recorded receivable.
Expenses occurred faster than the agreed upon prepayments.
The amount of checks written exceeded the positive amount in the Cash account.

Before issuing the balance sheet, any errors (such as items 1 and 2) need to be corrected. The accounts with credit balances in items 3, 4, and 5 need to be reclassified to the liability section of the balance sheet.",what
"In accounting, are debit balances good?","It is best if you accept the meaning that the word debit has had for 500 years: a debit is an amount entered on the left-side of an account. Don't add ""good"" or ""bad"" or ""add"" or ""subtract"" or other meanings.
If you associate the word ""good"" with debits, you will have a problem when it comes to expenses. After all, expenses have debit balances. Since expenses will reduce a company's profits, they are not good.
Lots of people have tried to make debit mean something more than left side. It never works. That's why after 500 years we are still using the unusual word debit.",what
What is the difference between an adjunct account and a contra account?,"Let's illustrate adjunct and contra accounts with bonds payable. If a corporation issues $100,000 of its bonds payable for a price of 97, it will be issuing the bonds at a discount of 3%. Its journal entry will include a debit to Cash for $97,000; a credit to Bonds Payable for $100,000; and a debit to Discount on Bonds Payable for $3,000. Discount on Bonds Payable is a contra account because it is a liability account with a debit amount. The carrying value of the bonds will begin at $97,000 since the $100,000 in Bonds Payable is offset by the $3,000 debit in Discount on Bonds Payable.
If a corporation issues $300,000 of bonds at a price of 102, it will be issuing the bonds at a premium of 2%. The journal entry will include a debit to Cash for $306,000; a credit to Bonds Payable for $300,000; and a credit to Premium on Bonds Payable for $6,000. Since a credit balance is the normal balance for a liability account, the account Premium on Bonds Payable cannot be referred to as a contra account. Here is where the term adjunct account is used. Immediately after the bonds are issued, the bonds will have a carrying value of $306,000 ($300,000 PLUS $6,000).
Some people might use the term adjunct accounts for both the Discount on Bonds Payable and for the Premium on Bonds Payable. Others might use the term valuation accounts.
Other examples of contra accounts include Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, Accumulated Depreciation, Discount on Notes Payable, Bond Issue Costs, Discount on Notes Receivable, LIFO Reserve, and certain investment accounts.",what
Why doesn't the balance sheet equal the post-closing trial balance?,"The totals on the balance sheet will not equal the totals on the post-closing trial balance due to contra accounts. We will use  the contra account  Accumulated Depreciation to illustrate why this occurs.
The account Accumulated Depreciation will have a credit balance and it will be listed in the credit column of the trial balance. Its credit balance will be included with the other credit balances, most of which are liability accounts and owner or stockholder equity accounts.
On the balance sheet, the credit balance in Accumulated Depreciation will not be reported with the other credit balances. Rather, the credit balance in Accumulated Depreciation will be a deduction from the debit balances reported in the asset section entitled property, plant and equipment.",what
Why does a company debit Purchases instead of Inventory?,"Under the periodic inventory system a company determines its inventory value based on an estimated or actual physical count of goods multiplied by the unit costs of the items. As a result, the costs of the goods purchased by the company will be debited to the temporary account Purchases. Under the periodic inventory system, there will also be temporary accounts that will be credited for Purchase Returns and Allowances and for Purchase Discounts.
If a company wants its Inventory account to have a running dollar amount, it will use the perpetual inventory system. Under the perpetual inventory system, the costs of the goods purchased are debited to Inventory. The perpetual system also requires that the Inventory account be credited for the cost of the goods sold, for purchase returns and allowances, and for purchase discounts.",what
What is a voided check?,"A voided check is a check written or partially written but then canceled or deleted by the maker of the check.
The notation of ""void"" is used because checks are prenumbered for control purposes and every check needs to be accounted for.
Voided checks may require some adjustments when reconciling the bank statement. For example, if a check is written in December but is voided in January, the Cash account in the company's general ledger will need to be increased when the check is voided. (Another account will need to be credited because of double entry bookkeeping.)",what
Is a postdated check considered to be currency?,"A postdated check—a check with a date that is later than the current date—is not considered to be currency. Further, the postdated check should not be reported as part of the Cash account balance until the date of the check.
If the postdated check was received as payment on accounts receivable, the accounts receivable balance is not reduced until the date of the check.
To illustrate this, let's assume that on August 20 a company receives a $1,000 postdated check. The check is dated September 5 and represents the full payment on one of the company's accounts receivable. Since the postdated check is not considered to be money until the date of the check, the accounts receivable should not be reduced and cash should not be increased until September 5. Therefore, the company's August 31 balance sheet will report that the customer's $1,000 accounts receivable is still due.",what
What are invoice payment terms?,"A sales invoice will specify when the purchaser, customer, or client must pay for the goods or services that were (or will be) provided by the seller. Some of the more common payment terms include:

Due upon receipt
Net 30 days
2/10, net 30 days
1/10, net 30 days

In regards to the payment terms, the word net means the invoice amount minus any sales returns and/or sales allowances approved by the seller. For instance, if some of the goods received by the purchaser were damaged, the seller is likely to grant a sales allowance. Therefore, if the sales invoice is $2,100 and the seller granted the purchaser a $100 sales allowance, the net amount owed to the seller is $2,000.
The first two terms listed above do not permit the purchaser to take a discount for paying quickly. The remaining two terms communicate that a discount is offered if the purchaser pays within 10 days instead of paying in 30 days. (This discount is known as an early payment discount, a sales discount, or a cash discount.) For example, if an invoice states that the payment terms are 2/10, net 30 days it means that the purchaser may deduct 2% from the net amount owed, but only if the payment is made within 10 days of the invoice date (or perhaps within 10 days after the purchaser receives the invoice). Hence, if the sales invoice is $2,100 and the seller grants a $100 sales allowance, the net amount or $2,000 is due within 30 days. However, the 2/10, net 30 days allows the purchaser to deduct $40 (2% times the net amount of $2,000) if the purchaser remits $1,960 within 10 days. [When the terms are 1/10, net 30 days the purchaser can deduct 1% of the net amount if the amount is remitted within the discount period of 10 days.]
Not all sellers offer discounts for early payments. When sellers do offer the early payment discounts, generally they record the invoice amount as a credit to the Sales account and a debit to Accounts Receivable. If the purchaser remits the amount due within the discount period, the seller will 1) debit Cash for the amount received, 2) debit Sales Discounts for the allowed amount of the early payment discount, and 3) will credit Accounts Receivable for the total of the two debits (which should be the amount of the invoice).",what
What does a debit signify in bookkeeping?,"In bookkeeping, a debit can signify an increase in an asset, an expense, and the owner's draws. A debit can also signify a decrease in a liability, revenues, and owner's equity.
A debit is one-half of bookkeeping's double-entry system. The other half is a credit.
A debit is also the amount entered on the left-side of a T-account.",what
Where is the discount on the purchase of office furniture recorded?,"The discount received on the purchase of office furniture that will be used by a company is recorded in the same asset account in which the office furniture is recorded. That account might be Furniture and Fixtures or Office Furniture. (The discount is not recorded in Purchase Discounts as this account is only for the discounts on the purchase of merchandise that will be sold.)
To illustrate, let's assume that a company purchases furniture for the office of a newly appointed executive. The cost of the furniture is $10,000 and the invoice allows a discount of 1% if it is paid within 10 days. If the company pays the invoice within 10 days, the Furniture and Fixtures account will increase by $9,900 ($10,000 minus the discount of $100). The depreciation calculations will be based on the cost of $9,900.",what

How do you record the sales tax on the purchase of an asset?,"Accountants define the cost of an asset as all of the costs that are necessary to obtain the asset and to get it ready for use.
If your state does not allow an exemption from sales tax for the asset you purchased, the sales tax should be recorded as part of the cost of the asset.",what
"In bookkeeping, why are revenues credits?","In bookkeeping, revenues are credits because revenues cause owner's equity or stockholders' equity to increase.
Recall that the accounting equation, Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity, must always be in balance. The asset accounts are expected to have debit balances, while the liability and owner's equity accounts are expected to have credit balances. Therefore, when a company earns revenues, it will debit an asset account (such as Accounts Receivable) and will need to credit another account such as Service Revenues. The credit balance in Service Revenues will eventually be moved to the sole proprietor's capital account or to a corporation's Retained Earnings account (thereby increasing the credit balance in one of those owner's or stockholders' equity accounts).",what
What is a transposition error?,"Definition of Transposition Error
A transposition error occurs when an amount is recorded incorrectly as the result of switching the positions of two (or more) digits. The switching of the positions causes a difference (between the recorded amount and the correct amount) that will be evenly divisible by 9.
Examples of Transposition Errors
For example, if 986 was the correct amount, but it was recorded incorrectly as 968, the difference between the two amounts is 18. Since this difference is evenly divisible by 9 (18 divided by 9 = exactly 2), the mistake is described as a transposition error. Another example of the many possible transposition errors is recording 3662 as 3626. In this situation, the difference between the correct and incorrect amounts is 36. Because the difference is evenly divisible by 9 (36 divided by 9 = exactly 4), this indicates that the error could be the result of transposing digits.
Determining Whether a Transposition Error Was Involved
If you are faced with finding a difference between two amounts, you might save some time by first dividing the difference by 9. (A few differences that are evenly divisible by 9 include: 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, etc.) Knowing that the error could be a transposition error may lead you to first review the more relevant amounts.",what
Does the accrual method apply to the purchase of equipment?,"The accrual method does apply to the purchase of equipment (as well as applying to revenues and expenses).
To illustrate, let's assume that on December 29 a company ordered and received some equipment to be used in its operations. The payment for the equipment is to be made on February 10. Under the accrual method, on December 29 the company should debit the asset account Equipment and credit the liability account Accounts Payable. (When the supplier or vendor is paid on February 10, the company's asset Cash will be credited and its liability account Accounts Payable will be debited.)",what
Why are some plastic cards called debit cards?,"I assume the name debit card relates to the reduction in the cardholder's checking account balance at the time that the card is used. The checking account balances of a bank's customers are liabilities for the bank. When the cardholder uses his or her debit card, the bank's liability account such as Customer Checking Accounts or Demand Deposits will be reduced. To reduce the normal credit balance in the bank's liability account, a debit entry is required.
The name debit card also helps to distinguish it from a credit card. The use of a credit card means that the bank (or other financial institution) is making a loan or providing credit to the cardholder. Usually the cardholder will receive a monthly statement showing the credit card transactions and must remit at least a portion of the amount owed within a stated amount of time. The bank will also charge interest on the unpaid balances.",what
How do you record a check that clears the bank months after it was voided? ,"Since you had voided the check months earlier, your general ledger no longer reflects 1) the original credit to the cash account, and 2) the original debit to another account. Now that the voided check has cleared the bank account, you will need to record the check in your general ledger. The entry will be a credit to the general ledger cash account and a debit (or debits) to the appropriate account.
It might be helpful to recall the bank reconciliation rule: Put it where it isn't. The old check, which you had voided, is now on the bank statement, but it is not in the cash account. Therefore, you need to put the check amount into the general ledger.",what
What is the entry for an employee's personal phone calls included in the company's bill?,"Let's assume that an employee has made personal phone calls of $20 which are included in the company's phone bill of $100. Below are two options for recording the cost of the employee's personal phone calls.
If the employee is paying (reimbursing) the company immediately, you can record the entire phone bill with a debit of $100 to the company's account Telephone Expense. You will also credit Telephone Expense for $20 when you record the $20 receipt from the employee.
If the employee is not paying the company immediately, you can record the $100 phone bill by debiting Telephone Expense for $80 and debiting the asset account Receivable from Employees for $20. When you receive the $20 from the employee, you will credit the account Receivable from Employees.",what
Our income statement shows wide fluctuations in utilities expense from month to month. I suspect our accounting is not proper. Any suggestions?,"Under accrual accounting, your income statement should report the amount for the utilities used during the period of the income statement. The utility bills tell you the cost of the gas and electricity used between the meter reading dates appearing on the utility bill. For example, if the meters are read on the last day of the month then the utility bills received in early July will tell you the cost of the utilities used during the month of June. It is this cost that your company should report as expense on its June income statement. The amount of the utility bills with meter reading dates of June 30 should be reported as a current liability (accounts payable) as of June 30.
When the utility bills are based on monthly meter readings other than on the last day of the month, it gets a bit more complicated. For example, if the meters are read on the 20th day of each month, then the utility bill received at the end of June will show the cost of the utilities used between May 21 and June 20. The amount of this bill is also the liability amount as of June 20th. Since the balance sheet is dated June 30th (and the income statement is for the entire month of June), an adjusting entry should be made to record the additional liability for the utilities used from June 20 through June 30.
To have the correct amount on the income statement, you need to report the expense for the 30 or 31 days during the calendar month that the utilities were used. To have the correct liability amount reported on the balance sheet, you need to report the cost of the utilities used through the last day of the month that have not yet been paid. The reason for this complexity is that the utility provides the electricity and gas each day, but it reads the meters only on one day per month. As a result you will always owe the utility some amount, even if you have paid the most recent utility bill. In short you will need to make an adjusting entry to get the financial statements accurate under accrual accounting.
You raised an important point. You should discuss this further with your accountant.",what
What is the double declining balance method of depreciation?,"Definition of Double Declining Balance Method of Depreciation
The double declining balance method of depreciation, also known as the 200% declining balance method of depreciation, is a form of accelerated depreciation. This means that compared to the straight-line method, the depreciation expense will be faster in the early years of the asset's life but slower in the later years. However, the total amount of depreciation expense during the life of the assets will be the same. 
The ""double"" means 200% of the straight line rate of depreciation, while the ""declining balance"" refers to the asset's book value or carrying value at the beginning of the accounting period. Since book value is an asset's cost minus its accumulated depreciation, the asset's book value will be decreasing when the contra asset account Accumulated Depreciation is credited with the depreciation expense of the accounting period.
Example of Double Declining Balance Depreciation
Let's assume that a retailer purchases fixtures on January 1 at a cost of $100,000. It is expected that the fixtures will have no salvage value at the end of their useful life of 10 years. Under the straight-line method, the 10-year life means the asset's annual depreciation will be 10% of the asset's cost. Under the double declining balance method the 10% straight line rate is doubled to 20%. However, the 20% is multiplied times the fixture's book value at the beginning of the year instead of the fixture's original cost.
At the beginning of the first year, the fixture's book value is $100,000 since the fixtures have not yet had any depreciation. Therefore, under the double declining balance method the $100,000 of book value will be multiplied by 20% and will result in $20,000 of depreciation for Year 1. The journal entry will be a debit of $20,000 to Depreciation Expense and a credit of $20,000 to Accumulated Depreciation.
At the beginning of the second year, the fixture's book value will be $80,000, which is the cost of $100,000 minus the accumulated depreciation of $20,000. When the $80,000 is multiplied by 20% the result is $16,000 of depreciation for Year 2.
At the beginning of Year 3, the asset's book value will be $64,000. This is the fixture's cost of $100,000 minus its accumulated depreciation of $36,000 ($20,000 + $16,000). The book value of $64,000 multiplied by 20% is $12,800 of depreciation expense for Year 3.
At the beginning of Year 4, the asset's book value will be $51,200. Therefore, the book value of $51,200 multiplied by 20% will result in $10,240 of depreciation expense for Year 4.
At the beginning of Year 5, the asset's book value will be $40,960. This is the amount to be depreciated over the remaining 6 years. In year 5, companies often switch to straight-line depreciation and debit Depreciation Expense and credit Accumulated Depreciation for $6,827 ($40,960/6 years) in each of the six remaining years.",what
What is a journal entry?,"Definition of a Journal Entry
In manual accounting or bookkeeping systems, business transactions are first recorded in a journal...hence the term journal entry.
Journal entries that are recorded in a company's general journal will consist of the following:

the appropriate date
the account(s) and amount(s) that will be debited
the account(s) and amount(s) that will be credited
a short description/memo/reference

The journal entries appear in a journal in order by date and are then posted to the appropriate accounts in the general ledger.
Computerized accounting systems will automatically record most of the business transactions into the general ledger accounts immediately after the software prepares the sales invoices, issues checks to creditors, processes receipts from customers, etc. Hence, we will not write journal entries for most of the business transactions.
Examples of Journal Entries
Even with computerized accounting systems some general journal entries are necessary. Common general journal entries are the adjusting entries. For example, prior to issuing the company's financial statements there will be an adjusting entry to record depreciation. This journal entry will debit Depreciation Expense and will credit Accumulated Depreciation.
Another example of a general journal entry is the adjusting entry to accrue interest on a bank loan. This journal entry will debit Interest Expense and will credit Interest Payable.",what
What is accumulated depreciation?,"Definition of Accumulated Depreciation
Accumulated depreciation is the total amount of a plant asset's cost that has been allocated to depreciation expense (or to manufacturing overhead) since the asset was put into service. Accumulated depreciation (and the related depreciation expense) are associated with constructed assets such as buildings, machinery, office equipment, furniture, fixtures, vehicles, etc.
Accumulated Depreciation is also the title of the contra asset account. Accumulated Depreciation is credited when Depreciation Expense is debited each accounting period.
Subtracting accumulated depreciation from an asset's cost results in the asset's book value or carrying value. Hence, the credit balance in the account Accumulated Depreciation cannot exceed the debit balance in the related asset account.
Example of Accumulated Depreciation
Assume that a company purchased a delivery vehicle for $50,000 and determined that the depreciation expense should be $9,000 for 5 years. Each year the account Accumulated Depreciation will be credited for $9,000. Since this is a balance sheet account, its balance keeps accumulating. Therefore, after three years the balance in Accumulated Depreciation will be a credit balance of $27,000 and the vehicle's book value will be $23,000 ($50,000 minus $27,000).
It is important to note that an asset's book value does not indicate the vehicle's market value since depreciation is merely an allocation technique.
If the vehicle is sold, both the vehicle's cost and its accumulated depreciation at the date of the sale will be removed from the accounts. If the amount received is greater than the book value, a gain will be recorded. If the amount received is less than the book value, a loss is recorded.",what
Why is depreciation on the income statement different from the depreciation on the balance sheet?,"Definition of Depreciation
Depreciation is the systematic allocation of an asset's cost to expense over the useful life of the asset.
Example of Depreciation
Let's assume that a retailer purchased displays for its store at a cost of $120,000. The displays have a useful life of 10 years and will have no salvage value. The straight-line method of depreciation will result in depreciation of $1,000 per month ($120,000 divided by 120 months). The monthly journal entry to record the depreciation will be a debit of $1,000 to the income statement account Depreciation Expense and a credit of $1,000 to the balance sheet contra asset account Accumulated Depreciation.
Depreciation on the Income Statement
The depreciation reported on the income statement is the amount of depreciation expense that is appropriate for the period of time indicated in the heading of the income statement. 
Using our example, the monthly income statements will report $1,000 of depreciation expense. The quarterly income statements will report $3,000 of depreciation expense, and the annual income statements will report $12,000 of depreciation expense. Each month $1,000 of depreciation expense is being matched to the 120 monthly income statements during which the displays are used to generate sales revenues.
Depreciation on the Balance Sheet
The depreciation reported on the balance sheet is the accumulated or the cumulative total amount of depreciation that has been reported as depreciation expense on the income statement from the time the assets were acquired until the date of the balance sheet.
Using our example, after one month of use the accumulated depreciation for the displays will be $1,000. After 24 months of use, the accumulated depreciation reported on the balance sheet will be $24,000. After 120 months, the accumulated depreciation reported on the balance sheet will be $120,000. At that point, the depreciation will stop since the displays' cost of $120,000 has been fully depreciated. If the displays continue to be used in the 11th year, there will be no depreciation expense in the 11th year and the accumulated depreciation will continue to be $120,000.",what
What is a contra asset account?,"Definition of Contra Asset Account
A contra asset account is an asset account where the account balance is a credit balance. It is described as ""contra"" because having a credit balance in an asset account is contrary to the normal or expected debit balance. (A debit balance in a contra asset account will violate the cost principle.)
Examples of Contra Asset Accounts
The most common contra asset account is Accumulated Depreciation. Accumulated Depreciation is associated with property, plant and equipment (plant assets). Accumulated Depreciation will be credited when Depreciation Expense is recorded. The credit balance in Accumulated Depreciation means that the cost of the property, plant and equipment will continue to be reported. Looking at the cost of the plant assets and the credit balance in Accumulated Depreciation allows us to see how much of the plant assets' cost has been depreciated and how much has not been depreciated.
Another contra asset account is Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. This account appears next to the current asset Accounts Receivable. The account Allowance for Doubtful Account is credited when the account Bad Debts Expense is debited under the allowance method. The use of Allowance for Doubtful Accounts allows us to see in Accounts Receivable the total amount that the company has a right to collect from its credit customers. The credit balance in the account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts tells us how much of the debit balance in Accounts Receivable is unlikely to be collected.
A less common example of a contra asset account is Discount on Notes Receivable. The credit balance in this account is amortized or allocated to Interest Income or Interest Revenue over the life of a note receivable.",what
What entry is made when selling a fixed asset?,"Defining the Entries When Selling a Fixed Asset
When a fixed asset or plant asset is sold, there are several things that must take place:

The fixed asset's depreciation expense must be recorded up to the date of the sale
The fixed asset's cost and the updated accumulated depreciation must be removed
The cash received must be recorded
The difference between the amounts removed in 2. and the cash received in 3. is recorded as a gain or loss on the sale of the fixed assets

Example of Entries When Selling a Plant Asset
Assume that on January 31, a company sells one of its machines that is no longer used for $3,000. Depreciation was last recorded on December 31. Also assume that the depreciation expense is $400 per month and the general ledger shows the machine's cost was $50,000 and its accumulated depreciation at December 31 was $39,600.
On January 31, the date the machine is sold, the company must record January's depreciation. This entry debits $400 to Depreciation Expense and credits $400 to Accumulated Depreciation.
Also on January 31, the company must debit Cash for $3,000 (the amount received); debit Accumulated Depreciation for $40,000 (the balance after the January 31 entry); debit Loss of Sale of Fixed Assets $7,000; and credit Machines for $50,000.
The $7,000 loss recorded on January 31 is the result of removing the machine's book value of $10,000 (cost of $50,000 minus its accumulated depreciation of $40,000), and replacing it with $3,000 of cash.
If the cash that the company received was greater than the asset's book value, the company would record the difference as a credit to Gain on Sale of Fixed of Assets.",what
What is the accounting journal entry for depreciation?,"Definition of Journal Entry for Depreciation
The journal entry for depreciation is:

Debit to the income statement account Depreciation Expense
Credit to the balance sheet account Accumulated Depreciation

The income statement account Depreciation Expense is a temporary account. Therefore, at the end of each year, its balance is closed and the account Depreciation Expense will begin the next year with a zero balance.
The account Accumulated Depreciation is a balance sheet account and therefore its balance is not closed at the end of the year. Accumulated Depreciation is a contra asset account whose credit balance will get larger every year. However, its credit balance cannot exceed the cost of the asset being depreciated.
Purpose of Journal Entry for Depreciation
The purpose of the journal entry for depreciation is to achieve the matching principle. In each accounting period, part of the cost of certain assets (equipment, building, vehicle, etc.) will be moved from the balance sheet to depreciation expense on the income statement. The goal is to match the cost of the asset to the revenues in the accounting periods in which the asset is being used.
More Information on the Depreciation Entry
It is important to understand the following:

The depreciation entry will cause a decrease in the company's net income, but the company's cash is not decreasing. (Cash was decreased when the asset was acquired.)
The depreciation entry is an estimate based on the asset's historical cost, its estimated useful life, and its estimated salvage value.
The depreciation entry is an allocation of the asset's cost, it is not an attempt to indicate the current market value of the asset.",what
What is the cost principle?,"Definition of Cost Principle
The cost principle is one of the basic underlying guidelines in accounting. It is also known as the historical cost principle. 
The cost principle requires that assets be recorded at the cash amount (or the equivalent) at the time that an asset is acquired. Further, the amount recorded will not be increased for inflation or improvements in market value. (An exception is the change in market value of a short-term investment in the capital stock of a corporation whose shares of stock are actively traded on a major stock exchange.)
Example of Cost Principle
The cost principle means that a long-term asset purchased for the cash amount of $50,000 will be recorded at $50,000. If the same asset was purchased for a down payment of $20,000 and a formal promise to pay $30,000 within a reasonable period of time and with a reasonable interest rate, the asset will also be recorded at $50,000.
A long-term asset that will be used in a business (other than land) will be depreciated based on its cost. The cost will be reported on the balance sheet along with the amount of the asset's accumulated depreciation. Further, the accumulated depreciation cannot exceed the asset's cost. 
The cost principle prohibits a company from recording an asset that was not acquired in a transaction. Hence, a company cannot report its highly successful management team as an asset nor can it report its highly valuable trademark that it developed over many years. (As a result of the cost principle, some of a company's most valuable assets will not appear as assets on the company's balance sheet.) On the other hand, if the company acquires a competitor's trademark in a $3 million transaction, that trademark will be reported as an asset at its cost of $3 million.",what
How do I calculate depreciation using the sum of the years' digits?,"Definition of Sum of the Years' Digits Depreciation
The sum of the years' digits depreciation (SYD depreciation) is one method for calculating accelerated depreciation. (A more common method of accelerated depreciation is the declining balance method used in tax depreciation.) Compared to the straight line depreciation method, the sum of the years' digits method will result in greater depreciation in the earlier years of an asset's useful life and less in the later years. However, the total amount of depreciation over an asset's useful life should be the same regardless of which depreciation method is used. The difference is in the timing of when the depreciation will be reported.
Example of Sum of the Years' Digits Depreciation
To illustrate the SYD method of depreciation, let's assume that equipment is purchased at a cost of $160,000. This asset is expected to have a useful life of 5 years and then be sold for $10,000. This means that the total amount of depreciation will be $150,000 spread over its useful life of 5 years.
The next step is to sum (add) up the digits in the five years of the asset's useful life: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15. The ""15"" will be the denominator for the fractions 5/15, 4/15, 3/15, etc. In the first year of the asset's life, 5/15 of the $150,000 or $50,000 will be debited to Depreciation Expense and $50,000 will be credited to Accumulated Depreciation.
In the second year of the asset's life, the depreciation amount will be $40,000 (4/15 of $150,000). The third year the depreciation will be $30,000 (3/15 of $150,000). The fourth year depreciation will be $20,000 (2/15 of $150,000). In the fifth year of the asset's life, the depreciation will be $10,000 (1/15 of $150,000). Remember that in this example, the total amount of depreciation during the asset's useful life needs to add up to $150,000.
Instead of adding the individual digits in the years of the asset's useful life, the following formula can be used to compute the sum of the digits: n(n+1) divided by 2, where n = the useful life in years. Using this formula for our example, we have: 5(5+1)/2 = 5(6)/2 = 30/2 = 15. [If the formula is used for an asset having a useful life of 10 years, the digits will sum to the following: 10(10+1)/2 = 10(11)/2 = 110/2 = 55. In the first year of this asset's useful life, the depreciation will be 10/55 of the amount to be depreciated. The second year will use 9/55 and the tenth year will use 1/55.]",what
Why is Accumulated Depreciation an asset account?,"Definition of Accumulated Depreciation
The account Accumulated Depreciation reports the total amount of depreciation expense that has been recorded from the time the asset was put into service until the date of the balance sheet. By crediting Accumulated Depreciation (instead of crediting the asset account which has the asset's original cost), it allows for the balance sheet to report or disclose the following:

The original cost of the asset being depreciated
The amount of depreciation expense reported so far (the balance in Accumulated Depreciation)
The amount that has not yet been depreciated (the book value of the asset)

Example of Accumulated Depreciation
Let's assume that at the beginning of the current year a company's asset account Equipment reported a cost of $70,000. From the time the equipment was put into service until the beginning of the year the related Accumulated Depreciation account shows a credit balance of $45,000. During the current year the company debits Depreciation Expense for $10,000 and credits Accumulated Depreciation for $10,000. Therefore, at the end of the current year the credit balance in Accumulated Depreciation is $55,000.
By crediting the account Accumulated Depreciation instead of crediting the Equipment account, the balance sheet at the end of the year can easily report both the equipment's cost of $70,000 and its accumulated depreciation of $55,000, the net of which is $15,000. This is more informative than reporting only the net amount of $15,000 (which would likely be the case if the contra asset account Accumulated Depreciation was not used).",what
Is there a difference between an expense and an expenditure?,"Definition of Expense
An expense is reported on the income statement in the period in which the cost matches the related sales, has expired, was used up, or had no future value. 
Examples of Expenses
Examples of expenses include the cost of the goods that were sold during the current period, and the following which also occurred during the current period: salaries earned by the company's employees, interest expense incurred, commissions earned by sales representatives, rent and utilities for a retail store, and many others.
Definition of Expenditure
An expenditure is a payment or disbursement. The expenditure may be for the purchase of an asset, a reduction of a liability, a distribution to the owners, or it could be payment in the same accounting period as the amount becomes an expense.
Examples of Expenditures
Examples of expenditures that will not be an expense in the accounting period in which the payments are made include the purchase of land for a future expansion and the principal portion of a monthly loan payment.
Here is an example to illustrate the difference between an expense and an expenditure. A company makes an expenditure of $255,500 to purchase equipment. The expenditure occurs on a single day and the equipment is immediately placed in service. Assuming the equipment will be used for seven years, the asset's cost could be reported on the income statement as depreciation expense of $100 per day for the next 2,555 days (7 years of use).",what
What is depreciation?,"Definition of Depreciation
In accounting, depreciation is the assigning or allocating of the cost of a plant asset (other than land) to expense in the accounting periods that are within the asset's useful life. 
Example of Depreciation
Let's assume that a business purchases a delivery truck with a cost of $100,000 and it is expected to be used for 5 years. If we also assume that the truck will have no salvage value, the company will record depreciation expense of $100,000 over the five years. When the straight-line method of depreciation is used the annual depreciation expense will be $20,000. (The amounts can vary depending on the depreciation method and assumptions.)",what
What is depreciation expense?,"Definition of Depreciation Expense
Depreciation expense is the appropriate portion of a company's fixed asset's cost that is being used up during the accounting period shown in the heading of the company's income statement.
Example of Depreciation Expense
To illustrate depreciation expense, assume that a company had paid $480,000 for its office building (excluding land) and the building has an estimated useful life of 40 years (480 months) with no salvage value. Using the straight-line method of depreciation, the  depreciation expense to be reported on each of the company's monthly income statements is $1,000 ($480,000 divided by 480 months).
Additional Information
Depreciation expense is referred to as a noncash expense because the recurring, monthly depreciation entry (a debit to Depreciation Expense and a credit to Accumulated Depreciation) does not involve a cash payment. As a result, the statement of cash flows prepared under the indirect method will add depreciation expense to the amount of net income.
Methods for computing depreciation expense other than straight-line include double-declining balance, sum-of-the-years digits, and units of production or activity.",what
"What is reported as property, plant and equipment?","Definition of Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment is the long-term asset or noncurrent asset section of the balance sheet that reports the tangible, long-lived assets that are used in the company's operations. These assets are commonly referred to as the company's fixed assets or plant assets.
Generally, the property, plant and equipment assets are reported at their cost followed by a deduction for the accumulated depreciation that applies to all of these assets except land (which is not depreciated).
Examples of Property, Plant and Equipment
Typical assets that are included in property, plant and equipment are land, buildings, machinery, equipment, vehicles, furniture, fixtures, office equipment, etc. which are used in the business. Also included in this balance sheet classification is a subtraction of the accumulated depreciation that pertains to these assets.",what
What is an impairment?,"Definition of Impairment
The term impairment is associated with an asset currently having a market value that is less than the asset's book value . A test is done to determine whether the asset's book value should be reduced to the current market value and to report the amount of the write-down (reduction) as a loss on its income statement.
Examples of Impairment
A meat packing plant in recent years invested large amounts in its plant and equipment. Since then, the company experienced a dramatic decline in the demand for its products and in the value of its plant and equipment. If the required test of impairment indicates that a loss must be recorded on its plant and equipment, its book value must be reduced and the resulting loss reported on its income statement.
A second example is Corporation X that acquired another company. The amount paid for the company resulted in Corporation X reporting a large amount for the intangible asset goodwill. Since the acquisition, the acquired company's value has declined to only a small fraction of the amount currently reported as goodwill. A test must be done and it may require a reduction in the reported amount of goodwill and a resulting impairment loss reported on the company's income statement.",what
What is Construction Work-in-Progress?,"Definition of Construction Work-in-Progress
Construction Work-in-Progress is a noncurrent asset account in which the costs of constructing long-term, fixed assets are recorded. The account Construction Work-in-Progress will have a debit balance and will be reported on the balance sheet as part of a company's noncurrent or long-term asset section entitled  Property, plant and equipment.
The costs of constructing the asset are accumulated in the account Construction Work-in-Progress until the asset is completed and placed into service. When the asset is placed into service, the account Construction Work-in-Progress will be credited for its balance (the accumulated costs) and will be recorded with a debit in the appropriate property, plant and equipment account.
Depreciation will begin after the asset is put into service.
Example of Construction Work-in-Progress
Let's assume that a company is expanding its warehouse and the project is expected to take four months to complete. The company will open the account Construction Work-in-Progress for Warehouse Expansion to accumulate the many expenditures that will occur. When the project is completed, the company will transfer the amount from Construction Work-in-Progress for Warehouse Expansion to the asset account Warehouse Expansion.",what
What is the difference between book depreciation and tax depreciation?,"Definition of Book Depreciation
Book depreciation is the amount recorded in the company's general ledger accounts and reported on the company's financial statements. This depreciation is based on the matching principle of accounting. 
Example of Book Depreciation
Let's assume that equipment used in a business has a cost of $500,000 and is expected to be used for 10 years. If the company assumes no salvage value at the end of the 10 years, the annual depreciation expense recorded in the general ledger accounts and reported on the financial statements will likely be $50,000 each year. Each year the company is matching $50,000 of the equipment's cost to that year's revenues that are earned because of the equipment.
Definition of Tax Depreciation
Tax depreciation refers to the amounts reported on the company's income tax returns and in the U.S. the tax depreciation is based on the regulations of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The tax regulations specify the useful life of assets but also allow for accelerated depreciation or the immediate expensing of certain amounts on some companies' tax returns. There is no regulation that requires the tax depreciation to be the same as the book depreciation in a given year. (However, over the life of an asset, the total depreciation expense for both will be limited to the asset's cost.)
Example of Tax Depreciation
Assuming the company purchases equipment of $500,000 the IRS regulations may require that the equipment be depreciated over 7 years and allows an accelerated method of depreciation. In some years the regulations may allow certain companies to charge the entire equipment's cost to depreciation in the first year. These regulations result in a company having larger depreciation deductions sooner and therefore receiving the income tax savings sooner. You can learn more about tax depreciation from www.IRS.gov or from a tax adviser.
Difference Between Book and Tax Depreciation
Generally, the difference between book depreciation and tax depreciation involves the ""timing"" of when the cost of an asset will appear as depreciation expense on a company's financial statements versus the depreciation expense on the company's income tax return. Hence, the depreciation expense in each year will likely be different, but the total of all of the years' depreciation expense for an asset will likely add up to the same total. 
The difference between book and tax depreciation leads some people to say, ""Oh, the company has two sets of books."" The fact is the company must 1) maintain depreciation records for the financial statement depreciation that is based on the matching principle, and also 2) maintain depreciation records for the tax return depreciation that is based on the IRS rules.",what
How do you calculate the gain or loss when an asset is sold?,"Definition of Gain or Loss on Sale of an Asset
The gain or loss on the sale of an asset used in a business is the difference between 1) the amount of cash that a company receives, and 2) the asset's book value (carrying value) at the time of the sale.
In order to know the asset's book value at the time of the sale, the depreciation expense for the asset must be recorded right up to the date that the asset is sold.
If the cash received is greater than the asset's book value, the difference is recorded as a gain. If the cash received is less than the asset's book value, the difference is recorded as a loss.
Example of a Gain on the Sale of an Asset
On March 31, a company sells its old delivery van for $4,000. The van's original cost was $45,000 and its accumulated depreciation was $43,600 as of the date of the sale. Therefore, the van's book value as of March 31 was $1,400 (cost of $45,000 minus accumulated depreciation of $43,600). Since the $4,000 of cash received by the company was greater than the van's book value of $1,400, there is a gain on the sale of the van of $2,600 ($4,000 minus $1,400).
The gain could also be determined by preparing the journal entry for the transaction:

Debit Cash for $4,000
Debit Accumulated Depreciation for $43,600 (to remove the credit balance)
Credit Delivery Van for $45,000 (to remove the original cost)
Credit Gain on Sale of Van for $2,600 (needed to balance the entry)

The credit of $2,600 will result in the entry having debits of $47,600 and credits of $47,600.",what
How do I compute the units of production method of depreciation?,"Definition of Units of Production Depreciation
The units of production method of depreciation (which is also referred to as the units of activity method) assumes that an asset's useful life is more related to its usage rather than the mere passage of time. Under the units of production method, depreciation during a given year will be greater when there is a higher volume of activity. In times of low usage the asset's depreciation will be less.
Example of Calculating Units of Production Depreciation
To illustrate the units of production method, let's assume that a company has a machine with a cost of $500,000 and a useful life that is expected to end after producing 240,000 units of a component part. Further, the machine's salvage value at that point is assumed to be $20,000.
Given the above assumptions, the amount to be depreciated is $480,000 ($500,000 minus $20,000). Dividing the $480,000 by the machine's useful life of 240,000 units, the depreciation will be $2 per unit. If the machine produces 10,000 units in the first year, the depreciation for the year will be $20,000 ($2 x 10,000 units). If the machine produces 50,000 units in the next year, the depreciation will be $100,000 ($2 x 50,000 units). The depreciation will be calculated similarly each year until the asset's Accumulated Depreciation reaches $480,000.
The units of production method or units of activity method could be useful for depreciating airplanes and vehicles (based on miles used), printing machines (based on pages run), DVDs (based on number of times rented), etc.",what
What is materiality?,"Definition of Materiality
In accounting, materiality refers to the relative size of an amount. Relatively large amounts are material, while relatively small amounts are not material (or immaterial). Determining materiality requires professional judgement. For instance, a $20,000 amount will likely be immaterial for a large corporation with a net income of $900,000. However, the same $20,000 amount will be material for a small corporation with a net income of $40,000.
Another view of materiality is whether sophisticated investors would be misled if the amount was omitted or misclassified. If sophisticated investors would be misled or would have made a different decision, the amount is considered to be material. If sophisticated investors would not be misled or would not have made a different decision, the amount is judged to be immaterial. 
Example of Materiality
A classic example of the materiality concept is a company expensing a $20 wastebasket in the year it is acquired instead of depreciating it over its useful life of 10 years. The matching principle directs you to record the wastebasket as an asset and then report depreciation expense of $2 a year for 10 years. Materiality allows you to expense the entire $20 cost in the year it is acquired. The reason is that no investor, creditor, or other interested party would be misled by immediately expensing the $20 wastebasket.
Materiality also justifies large corporations having a policy of immediately expensing assets having a cost of less than $2,500 instead of setting up fixed asset records and depreciating those assets over their useful lives.",what
"What is the accounting treatment for an asset that is fully depreciated, but continues to be used in a business?","An asset that is fully depreciated and continues to be used in the business will be reported on the balance sheet at its cost along with its accumulated depreciation. There will be no depreciation expense recorded after the asset is fully depreciated. No entry is required until the asset is disposed of through retirement, sale, salvage, etc.
To illustrate this, let's assume that a machine with a cost of $100,000 was expected to have a useful life of five years and no salvage value. The company depreciated the asset at the rate of $20,000 per year for five years. If the machine is used for three more years, the depreciation expense will be $0 in each of those three years. During those three years, the balance sheet will report its cost of $100,000 and its accumulated depreciation of $100,000 for a book value of $0.",what
What is capitalized interest?,"Capitalized interest is the interest added to the cost of a self-constructed, long-term asset. It involves the interest on debt used to finance the asset's construction.
The details of capitalized interest are explained in the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 34, Capitalization of Interest Cost. You can find this accounting pronouncement at www.FASB.org/st.
In short, there must be debt involved (cash and common stock are not considered). The interest specified by the pronouncement is added to the cost of the project, instead of being expensed on the current period's income statement. This capitalized interest will be part of the asset's cost reported on the balance sheet, and will be part of the asset's depreciation expense that will be reported in future income statements.",what
What is the difference between assets and fixed assets?,"Assets are resources owned by a company as the result of transactions. Examples of assets are cash, accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid insurance, land, buildings, equipment, trademarks and customer lists purchased from another company, and certain deferred charges.
The term fixed assets generally refers to the long-term assets, tangible assets used in a business that are classified as property, plant and equipment. Examples of fixed assets are land, buildings, manufacturing equipment, office equipment, furniture, fixtures, and vehicles. Except for land, the fixed assets are depreciated over their useful lives.",what
Where does the purchase of equipment show up on a profit and loss statement?,"Reporting the Purchase of Equipment
Assuming that the purchase of equipment is a long-term or noncurrent asset that will be used in a business, the purchase will not  be reported on the profit and loss statement (income statement, statement of earnings). Rather, the equipment's cost will be reported in the general ledger account Equipment, which is reported on the balance sheet under the classification Property, plant and equipment. The purchase will also be included in the company's capital expenditures that are reported on the statement of cash flows in the section entitled cash flows from investing activities.
When the equipment is placed into service, the company will begin to report depreciation expense on the profit and loss statements during the years that the equipment is used.
Example of Equipment's Cost on Income Statement
Let's assume that a company buys equipment for $100,000 and it is expected to be used for 10 years with no salvage value at the end of its useful life. Using the straight-line method of depreciation, each year's profit and loss statement will report depreciation expense of $10,000 for 10 years. Each year the account Accumulated Depreciation will be credited for the $10,000 of annual depreciation.",what
How do you calculate an asset's salvage value?,"Definition of Asset Salvage Value
In accounting, an asset's salvage value is the estimated amount that a company will receive at the end of a plant asset's useful life. It is the amount of an asset's cost that will not be part of the depreciation expense during the years that the asset is used in the business.
Salvage value is also referred to as disposal value, residual value, or scrap value. 
Example of Asset Salvage Value
Perhaps the most common calculation of an asset's salvage value is to assume there will be no salvage value. As a result, the entire cost of the asset used in the business will be charged to depreciation expense during the years of the asset's expected useful life.
A salvage value of zero is reasonable since it is assumed that the asset will no longer be useful at the point when the depreciation expense ends. Even if the company receives a small amount, it may be offset by costs of removing and disposing of the asset.",what
What is a revenue expenditure?,"Definition of Revenue Expenditure
A revenue expenditure is a cost that will be an expense in the accounting period when the expenditure takes place.
Revenue expenditures are often discussed in the context of fixed assets. The revenue expenditures take place after a fixed asset had been put into service and simply keeps the asset in working order. (The amount spent to acquire a fixed asset is referred to as a capital expenditure. The amount of the capital expenditure will be recorded as an asset and will then be moved to the income statement as depreciation expense over the years of the asset's useful life.)
Example of Revenue Expenditure
Let's assume that a company made a capital expenditure of $100,000 to install a high efficiency machine. The new machine requires routine maintenance of $3,000 each month. This $3,000 is a revenue expenditure since it will be reported on the monthly income statement, thereby being matched with the month's revenues. Normal repairs to the machine are also a revenue expenditure, since the expenditure does not make the machine more than it was, nor does it extend the machine's useful life. As a result, normal repairs will also be reported on the income statement as an expense in the accounting period when the repair is made.",what
What is the difference between depreciation expense and accumulated depreciation?,"Definition of Depreciation Expense
Depreciation expense is the amount of depreciation that is reported on the income statement. In other words, it is the amount of an asset's cost that has been allocated and reported as an expense for the period (year, month, etc.) shown in the income statement's heading.
Definition of Accumulated Depreciation
Accumulated depreciation reports the total amount of depreciation that has been reported on all of the income statements from the time that the assets were put into service until the date of the balance sheet. The account Accumulated Depreciation is a contra asset account because it will have a credit balance. The credit balance is reported in the property, plant and equipment section of the balance sheet and it reduces the cost of the assets to their carrying value or book value.
Example of Depreciation Expense and Accumulated Depreciation
To illustrate, let's assume that a retailer purchases new display racks at a cost of $84,000. This asset is estimated to have a useful life of 7 years (84 months) and no salvage value at the end of 7 years. Assuming the retailer uses the straight-line depreciation method, during each month of the display racks' lives the retailer's monthly income statement will report depreciation expense of $1,000. However, the credit balance in Accumulated Depreciation will be reported on the balance sheet at $1,000 at the end of the first month, $2,000 at the end of the second month, $3,000 at the end of the third month, etc. until the balance in Accumulated Depreciation reaches $84,000 at the end of the 84th month.",what
What is a plant asset?,"What is a Plant Asset
A plant asset is an asset with a useful life of more than one year that is used in producing revenues in a business's operations. Plant assets are also known as fixed assets.
Plant assets are recorded at their cost and depreciation expense is recorded during their useful lives.
Plant assets (other than land) are depreciated over their useful lives and each year's depreciation is credited to a contra asset account Accumulated Depreciation.
Plant assets and the related accumulated depreciation are reported on a company's balance sheet in the noncurrent asset section entitled property, plant and equipment. Accounting rules also require that the plant assets be reviewed for possible impairment losses.
Examples of Plant Assets
Plant assets include:

Land (not depreciated)
Land improvements
Buildings
Machinery and equipment
Office equipment
Furniture and fixtures
Vehicles
Leasehold improvements
Construction work-in-progress (which is not depreciated until the asset is placed into service)",what
What is book value?,"Definition of Book Value
In accounting, book value refers to the amounts contained in the company's general ledger accounts (or books). It is important to realize that the book value is not the same as the fair market value because of the accountants' historical cost principle and matching principle.
Book value of an asset is: the asset's cost minus the asset's accumulated depreciation. 
Book value of the liability Bonds Payable is the combination of the following:

Maturity or par value of the bonds reported as a credit balance in Bonds Payable
Unamortized discount reported as a debit balance in Discount on Bonds Payable
Unamortized issue costs reported as a debit balance in Bond Issue Costs
Unamortized premium reported as a credit balance in Premium on Bonds Payable

Book value of a corporation is: the total amount of stockholders' equity appearing on a corporation's balance sheet. 
Examples of Book Value Calculations
If a company's computer system had a cost of $300,000 and it has accumulated depreciation of $80,000, the computer system has a book value of $220,000. 
If a company has issued bonds with a maturity value of $40,000,000 and its current balance sheet reports Unamortized Bond Discount of $800,000 and Unamortized Bond Issue Costs of $200,000, the book value of the bonds is $39,000,000.
If a corporation's balance sheet reports stockholders' equity of $245,000, the corporation's book value is that amount.
Reminder Concerning Book Value
Book value does not indicate the current market value. In our examples:

The current market value of the computer system may be far less than the book value of $220,000
The current market value of the corporation may be far more than its book value of $245,000",what
What are the effects of depreciation?,"Definition of Depreciation
Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the cost of a company's assets used in its business from the balance sheet to the income statement (as an expense) over their estimated useful lives.
Depreciation occurs through an accounting adjusting entry in which the account Depreciation Expense is debited and the contra asset account Accumulated Depreciation is credited.
Effects of Depreciation
The following are some of the effects for a corporation that is depreciating assets:

The net income, retained earnings, and stockholders' equity are reduced with the debit to Depreciation Expense
The carrying value of the assets being depreciated and amount of total assets are reduced by the credit to Accumulated Depreciation
The depreciation expense reported on the U.S. income tax return (based on the tax regulations) reduces a corporation's taxable income (and its related income tax payments).",what
What is scrap value?,"Definition of Scrap Value
In cost accounting, scrap value refers to a relatively insignificant amount that a manufacturer receives from the sale of production materials that remain after the manufacture of its products. 
In financial accounting, the term scrap value might be used instead of the more common terms of salvage value, disposal value, or residual value when calculating the depreciation of an asset used in the business. In this situation, scrap value is the expected or estimated value of the asset at the end of its useful life.
Examples of Scrap Value
A manufacturer of aluminum products melts aluminum. In the process it separates out small amounts of aluminum containing impurities. The relatively small amount of money that the manufacturer receives for the impure aluminum is known as the scrap value.
For examples of scrap value that is meant to be the disposal, residual, or salvage value of a plant asset, see our major topic Depreciation.",what
What is a noncash expense?,"Definition of a Noncash Expense
A noncash expense is an expense that is reported on the income statement of the current accounting period, but the related cash payment took place in another accounting period.
Example of a Noncash Expense
Perhaps the most common example of a noncash expense is depreciation. To illustrate, let's assume that a company purchased equipment two years ago for a cash payment of $200,000. The company determined that the equipment had a useful life of 10 years. As a result, the company's income statement will report depreciation expense of $20,000 a year for 10 years. The current year's income statement is reporting depreciation expense of $20,000 but there is no cash payment in the current year for this expense. This is why depreciation expense is referred to as a noncash expense.
This also explains why the operating activities section of the statement of cash flows usually begins with a company's net income and then immediately adds the period's depreciation expense. In effect the noncash depreciation expense is added back because the depreciation expense had reduced the company's net income reported on the income statement, but it did not use any cash during that period of time.",what
What does amortization mean?,"In accounting we use the word amortization to mean the systematic allocation of a balance sheet item to expense (or revenue) on the income statement. Conceptually, amortization is similar to depreciation and depletion. An example of amortization is the systematic allocation of the balance in the contra-liability account Discount of Bonds Payable to Interest Expense over the life of the bonds. (The accountant credits Discount on Bonds Payable and debits Bond Interest Expense with a portion of the balance each accounting period.) In the case of a premium on bonds payable, the accountant systematically moves a portion of the balance in Premium on Bonds Payable by debiting the account and crediting Interest Expense.
Amortization also applies to asset balances, such as discount on notes receivable, deferred charges, and some intangible assets.
Amortization is a term used with mortgage loans. For example, a mortgage lender often provides the borrower with a loan amortization schedule. This schedule lists each loan payment during the life of the loan, the amount of each payment that is for interest, the amount of each payment that is for principal, and the principal balance after each loan payment. The loan amortization schedule allows the borrower to see how the loan balance will be reduced over the life of the loan.",what
What is the entry to remove equipment that is sold before it is fully depreciated?,"Entries To Record a Sale of Equipment
When equipment that is used in a business is disposed of (sold) for cash before it is fully depreciated, two steps must be taken:

Record the depreciation expense right up to the date of the disposal
Remove the equipment's cost and the up-to-date accumulated depreciation, record the cash received, and record the resulting gain or loss

The first step requires a journal entry that:

Debits Depreciation Expense (for the depreciation up to the date of the disposal)
Credits Accumulated Depreciation (for the depreciation up to the date of the disposal)

The second step requires another journal entry to:

Credit the account Equipment (to remove the equipment's cost)
Debit Accumulated Depreciation (to remove the equipment's up-to-date accumulated depreciation)
Debit Cash for the amount received
Get this journal entry to balance. If a debit amount is needed (because the cash received was less than the equipment's book value), record a debit to Loss on Disposal of Equipment. If a credit amount is needed (because the cash received was greater than the equipment's book value, record a credit to Gain on Disposal of Equipment

(If the equipment is traded-in or exchanged for another asset, the second step will be different.)",what
Is the installation labor for a new asset expensed or included in the cost of the asset?,"Accounting for Labor to Install Asset
The definition of an asset's cost is all costs that are necessary to get an asset in place and ready for use. Therefore, the cost of the installation labor (wages and related fringe benefits) is part of the cost of the asset (and not an immediate expense of the accounting period).
The total cost of the asset, including installation costs, will become an expense when the asset depreciated over the asset's useful life.",what
How do you divide the cost of real estate into land and building?,"Dividing the Cost of Real Estate into Land and Building
In accounting, the cost of real estate must be divided into:

The cost of land (because land is not depreciated)
The cost of the structures (because these require depreciation)

Example of Dividing the Cost of Real Estate
Assume that a company purchases real estate (which includes land and a building) at a cost of $220,000. The appraisal at the time of the purchase indicates that the land has a market value of $50,000 and the building has a market value of $200,000...for a total market value of $250,000. In other words, the appraisal indicates that the land is 20% ($50,000/$250,000) of the market value, and the building is 80% ($200,000/$250,000) of the market value.
The cost principle requires that the purchase be recorded at its cost of $220,000. However, we can use the appraisal amounts as a logical way to divide up the cost of $220,000 between land and building. Here is one approach:

Assign or allocate $44,000 to the account Land. This is 20% of the $220,000 cost.
Assign or allocate $176,000 to the account Buildings. This is 80% of the $220,000 cost

A second approach is to compare the real estate's total cost of $220,000 to the total appraisal amount of $250,000. This shows that the total cost is 88% ($220,000/$250,000) of the total market value. Using this approach we will:

Assign or allocate 88% of the $50,000 market value = $44,000 to the Land account
Assign or allocate 88% of the $200,000 market value = $176,000 to the Buildings account",what
How do you account for a project under construction?,"Accounting for a Project Under Construction
If a company is constructing a major project such as a building, assembly line, etc., the amounts spent on the project will be debited to a long-term asset account categorized as Construction Work-in-Progress.
Construction Work-in-Progress is often reported as the last line within the balance sheet classification Property, Plant and Equipment.
There is no depreciation of the accumulated costs until the project is completed and the asset is placed into service.
When the completed asset is placed into service, the project's accumulated costs will be removed from the Construction Work-in-Progress account and will be debited to the appropriate plant asset account.",what
What is the difference between entries in a general journal versus a general ledger?,"Definition of General Journal
The general journal is described as the book of original entry. Today the general journal is used to record adjusting entries and transactions other than payments, receipts, or payroll. An entry in the general journal will include the date, the account with the amount that is to be debited, the account with the amount that is to be credited, and a brief description. After these relatively few transactions are recorded in the general journal, the amounts will be posted to the accounts indicated.
Definition of General Ledger
The general ledger contains the accounts used by the company to sort and store the amounts from all of the company's transactions (including all of the payments, receipts, payroll, and general journal entries). These accounts are known as general ledger accounts. The amounts and balances in the general ledger accounts are used to prepare the company's financial statements. 
Example of General Journal and General Ledger
Assume that a company depreciates its equipment at a rate of $10,000 per year.
In the general journal the company enters the following information:

December 31 (and the year)
Depreciation Expense $10,000 (in the debit column)
Accumulated Depreciation $10,000 (in the credit column)
A short explanation such as ""Depreciation for the Year""

Next, the amounts in the general journal must be posted to the specified accounts in the general ledger. In our example, the account Depreciation Expense will be debited as of December 31 for $10,000 and the account Accumulated Depreciation will be credited as of December 31 for $10,000.",what
Is depreciation expense an administrative expense? ,"Depreciation could be an administrative expense, but it can also be a selling expense, and a part of the cost of manufacturer's products.
Where depreciation is reported depends on the assets being depreciated. For example, the depreciation on the building and furnishings of a company's central administrative staff is considered an administrative expense. The depreciation on the sales staff's automobiles is considered part of the company's selling expenses. The depreciation on a manufacturer's factory and production equipment will be included in the overhead cost of the product. When a manufacturer's products are sold, some of the depreciation will be included in the cost of goods sold. When some of the manufactured products are held in inventory, some of the depreciation associated with the manufacturing process will be included in the cost of the inventory.
As you can see, depreciation is often part of many functions within a company. The company's depreciation should be assigned to each of the areas where the assets are utilized.",what
What is the purpose of depreciation?,"Purpose of Depreciation
The purpose of depreciation is to achieve the matching principle of accounting. That is, a company is attempting to match the historical cost of a productive asset (that has a useful life of more than a year) to the revenues earned from using the asset.
Since it is difficult to precisely match a productive asset's cost to a company's revenues, the asset's cost is usually allocated to the years in which the asset is used. In other words, depreciation systematically moves the asset's cost from the balance sheet to depreciation expense on the income statement over the asset's useful life. Accountants point out that depreciation is an allocation process which does not result in reporting the asset's market value.
Example of Recording Depreciation
The accounting entry to record depreciation is:

A debit to Depreciation Expense, and
A credit to Accumulated Depreciation (a contra-asset account that is reported in the same section of the balance sheet as the asset that is being depreciated).",what
What are capital expenditures?,"Definition of Capital Expenditures
Capital expenditures are the amounts spent for tangible assets that will be used for more than one year in the operations of a business. Capital expenditures, which are sometimes referred to as capex, can be thought of as the amounts spent to acquire or improve a company's fixed assets.
The capital expenditures increase the respective asset accounts which are reported in the noncurrent asset section of the balance sheet entitled property, plant and equipment. Once the assets (except for land) are placed in service they are depreciated over their useful lives. The accumulated depreciation for these assets is also reported as part of the property, plant and equipment.
The amount of capital expenditures for an accounting period is also reported in the cash flow statement as a negative amount (since it is a cash outflow) in the investing activities section. Many financial analysts subtract the capital expenditures amount from the cash from operating activities to arrive at the company's free cash flow.
Examples of Capital Expenditures
Capital expenditures include the amounts spent to acquire or make significant improvements to land, buildings, machinery, equipment, furniture, fixtures, vehicles, computer information systems, leasehold improvements, etc.",what
"What is the difference between residual value, salvage value, and scrap value?","The terms residual value, salvage value, and scrap value are often used when referring to the estimated value that is expected at the end of the useful life of the property, plant and equipment used in a business. This estimated amount is used to calculate the asset's depreciation expense and it is often assumed to be zero.
The term residual value may have other uses as well. For example, it is used when discussing leased assets.",what
What are the accounting entries for a fully depreciated car?,"Definition of a Fully Depreciated Car
A fully depreciated car is one where the car's historical cost has already been allocated to expense (except for the estimated salvage value, if any).
Accounting Entries for a Fully Depreciated Car
If the fully depreciated car continues to be used, there will be no further depreciation. The company cannot depreciate more than the car's cost. 
If the fully depreciated car is sold or scrapped, the following accounting entry is needed:

Debit to Cash for the amount received
Debit Accumulated Depreciation for the car's accumulated depreciation
Credit  the asset account containing the car's cost
Credit the account Gain on Sale of Vehicles for the amount necessary to have the total of the debit amounts equal to the total of the credit amounts",what
What is the difference between a land improvement and a leasehold improvement?,"Examples of land improvements include paved parking areas, driveways, fences, outdoor lighting, and so on. Land improvements are recorded separately from land, because land improvements have a limited life and are depreciated. Land is assumed to last indefinitely and will not be depreciated.
Land improvements are recorded in a general ledger asset account entitled Land Improvements. The depreciation of land improvements will result in depreciation expense on the company's income tax return. This will reduce its taxable income and will reduce a profitable company's income tax payments.
An example of a leasehold improvement is the permanent improvement to a building that is being rented under a 10 year lease. For instance, the tenant might construct permanent walls and offices inside of the warehouse that it leases from the owner. The lease will likely state that all improvements to the building will belong to the owner of the building. The amount spent by the tenant to improve the building will be recorded by the tenant in its asset account Leasehold Improvements. Generally, the amount of these leasehold improvements will be depreciated by the tenant over the useful life of the improvements or over the life of the lease, whichever is shorter. The depreciation expense associated with the leasehold improvements will reduce the tenant's taxable income and its income tax payments if the company is profitable.",what
How many years is the appropriate time for depreciating leasehold improvements?,"Leasehold improvements should be depreciated or amortized according to the lessee's normal depreciation policy except that the time period shall be the shorter of: 1) the useful life of the leasehold improvements, or 2) the remaining years of the lease. The remaining years of the lease include the years in the lease renewals that are reasonably assured.

Why isn't land depreciated?,"Land is not depreciated because land is assumed to have an unlimited useful life.
Other long-lived assets such as land improvements, buildings, furnishings, equipment, etc. have limited useful lives. Therefore, the costs of those assets must be allocated to those limited accounting periods. Since land's life is not limited, there is no need to allocate the cost of land to any accounting periods.",what
What is salvage value?,"In accounting, salvage value is an estimated amount that is expected to be received at the end of a plant asset's useful life. Salvage value is sometimes referred to as disposal value, residual value, terminal value, or scrap value.
The estimated salvage value is deducted from the cost of the asset in order to determine the total amount of depreciation expense that will be reported during the asset's useful life.
Accountants and income tax regulations often assume that plant assets will have no salvage value. This will result in an asset's entire cost being depreciated during the years that the asset is used in the business.",what
Is depreciation a source of funds?,"Definition of Depreciation
Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the cost of a business asset to expense over the useful life of the asset. The accounting for depreciation is a debit to Depreciation Expense and a credit to Accumulated Depreciation. As you can see, the entry does not involve the account Cash. Hence, depreciation expense is referred to as a noncash expense.
Example of Depreciation
Assume that a sidewalk florist operates a cash only business. During the most recent year, the florist had cash revenues of $100,000, cash expenses of $70,000, and depreciation expense of $8,000. Therefore, the net income reported on its income statement was $22,000. (The depreciation pertains to a truck purchased in an earlier year.)
Depreciation and the Statement of Cash Flows
The florist's statement of cash flows (using the indirect method) begins with the net income of $22,000. Next, the depreciation expense of $8,000 is shown as a positive amount and is added to the net income to arrive at $30,000, which equals the cash receipts of $100,000 minus cash expenses of $70,000.
Depreciation expense was added to the net income because the depreciation expense had reduced net income but cash was not reduced. In other words, the positive $8,000 of depreciation expense is not a source of cash, it is merely a needed adjustment to convert the accrual net income to the cash provided from the florist's operating activities. 
While the amount of depreciation expense is not a source of cash, it does reduce a corporation's taxable income. That in turn reduces a profitable corporation's cash payments for income taxes (by the amount of the corporation's income tax rate). The savings of income tax payments is equivalent to a source of cash.",what
What does Accumulated Depreciation tell us?,"Definition of Accumulated Depreciation
Accumulated depreciation reports the amount of depreciation that has been recorded from the time an asset was acquired until the date of the balance sheet.
What Accumulated Depreciation Tells Us
An asset's accumulated depreciation is subtracted from the asset's cost to indicate the asset's book value. The book value indicates the maximum amount of future depreciation remaining.
Since depreciation is defined as the allocation of an asset's cost based on the estimated useful life, the book value of the asset is not an indication of the asset's market value. For example, a building in an excellent location may be increasing in value even though the accumulated depreciation is increasing and therefore the book value is decreasing.
The amount reported in Accumulated Depreciation merely reports the total amount of an asset's cost that has been moved to the income statement in the form of depreciation expense since the asset was acquired.",what
Is depreciation a direct or indirect cost?,"Depreciation can be either a direct cost or an indirect cost, or it can be both direct and indirect.
Let's illustrate this with the depreciation of a machine used in Department 23 of a manufacturer. The depreciation on that machine is a direct cost for Department 23. It is direct because it is traceable to Department 23 without any allocation.
The depreciation of this same machine will be an indirect cost of the products manufactured with that machine. It is indirect because the depreciation is allocated to the products. Perhaps the machine in Department 23 has depreciation of $50,000 per year (cost of machine of $500,000 divided by 10 years of useful life). The $50,000 of annual depreciation is then assigned or allocated to products based on the number of hours that products use the machine. For example, if the manufacture expects 20,000 machine hours of use in the current year, then it assigns or allocates $2.50 ($50,000/20,000) per machine hour to each product using the machine. If Product #189 requires one hour of this machine's time, Product #189 will have $2.50 as part of its indirect costs. Indirect manufacturing costs are also referred to as manufacturing overhead, factory overhead, or burden.",what
What is straight line depreciation?,"Straight line depreciation is likely to be the most common method of matching a plant asset's cost to the accounting periods in which it is in service. Under the straight line method of depreciation, each full accounting year will be allocated the same amount or percentage of an asset's cost. (The total amount of depreciation over the years of the asset's useful life will be the asset's cost minus any expected or assumed salvage value.)
To illustrate straight line depreciation let's assume that a company purchases equipment at a cost of $430,000 and it is expected to be used in the business for 10 years. At the end of the 10 years, the company expects to receive a salvage value of $30,000. Under the straight line method each full accounting year will be allocated $40,000 of depreciation, which is one-tenth (1/10) or 10% of the $400,000 that needs to be depreciated over the useful life of the equipment. If the asset is purchased in the middle of the accounting year there will be $20,000 of depreciation in the first and the eleventh accounting year and $40,000 in each of the years 2 through 10.
In the U.S. a company may use the straight line method for its financial statements while at the same time be using the Internal Revenue Service's faster depreciation on its federal income tax return.",what
What is the difference between gains and proceeds in terms of long-term assets?,"When long-term assets are sold, the amounts received are referred to as the proceeds.
If the amount of the proceeds is greater than the book value or carrying value of the long-term asset at the time of the sale, the difference is a gain on the sale or disposal.  If the amount received is less than the book value, the difference is a loss on the sale or disposal. Depreciation must be recorded up to the date of the disposal in order to have the asset's book value at the time of the sale.
On the statement of cash flows, the proceeds from the sale of long-term assets are reported in the investing activities section, while the gain on the sale appears in the operating activities section as a deduction from net income.",what
"What is the advantage of using historical cost on the balance sheet for property, plant and equipment?","The main advantage of using historical cost on the balance sheet for property, plant and equipment is that historical cost can be verified. Generally, the cost at the time of purchase is documented with contracts, invoices, payments, transfer taxes, and so on.
The historical cost of plant and equipment (not land) is also used to determine the amount of depreciation expense reported on the income statement. The accumulated amount of depreciation is also reported as a deduction from the assets' historical costs reported on the balance sheet. (In the case of impairment, some assets might be reported at less than the amounts based on historical cost.)
The use of historical cost is also a disadvantage to those users of the financial statements who want to know the current values.",what
How are fully depreciated assets reported on the balance sheet?,"Fully depreciated assets that continue to be used are reported at cost in the Property, Plant and Equipment section of the balance sheet. The accumulated depreciation for these assets is also reported in this section. As a result, the combination of these assets' costs minus their accumulated depreciation will likely be a net amount of zero. This net amount is the carrying amount, carrying value or book value.
The cost and accumulated depreciation will continue to be reported until the company disposes of the assets. The disposal might be the sale or the retirement of the assets.
Fully depreciated assets and their resulting book value of zero reinforces accountants' position that depreciation is a process to allocate assets' costs to expense; it is not a process for valuing assets.",what
What is the units of activity depreciation?,"The units of activity depreciation is one of several methods of depreciation. The units of activity method of depreciation is unique in that a plant asset's useful life is expressed in the total units that are expected to be produced or the asset's total activity during its life. The asset's cost is then allocated to the accounting periods based on the plant asset's usage, units produced, activity, etc. Years and partial years are not relevant when using this depreciation method. (The other methods of depreciation express the plant asset's useful life in years and will allocate the plant asset's cost based on the mere passage of those years. Under these methods partial years are relevant.)
To illustrate the units of activity method of depreciation, let's assume that a company acquires a finishing machine that is expected to perform the finishing operation on a total of 100,000 units of product. The machine has a cost of $225,000 and is expected to have a salvage value of $25,000. Under the units of activity method, the company will record $2 of depreciation whenever it finishes a product. The $2 is computed as follows: ($225,000 - $25,000) divided by the expected 100,000 units of product. In an accounting year when 8,000 units are finished, the depreciation will be $16,000. In a year when 23,000 units are finished, the depreciation will be $46,000. The depreciation will continue until a total of $200,000 of depreciation has been taken (and the book value will be $25,000).
The units of activity method of depreciation is also referred to as the units of production method.",what
Why do we charge depreciation?,"We charge depreciation because most of the long-lived assets used in a business have 1) a significant cost, and 2) they will be useful only for a limited number of years. The matching principle (a basic underlying accounting principle) requires that the actual cost of these assets be allocated to the accounting periods in which the company will benefit from their use.
The depreciation reported on a U.S. corporation's external financial statements is computed by spreading an asset's cost (less any salvage value) over the asset's service life or useful life. For example, equipment with a cost of $500,000 and no salvage value at the end of an assumed useful life of 10 years will likely result in matching $50,000 to each full accounting year. (The U.S. income tax rules allow accelerating the depreciation amounts, but the total cannot exceed the asset's cost.)
Examples of the assets that must be depreciated include machinery, equipment, fixtures, furnishings, buildings, vehicles, etc. These assets are often referred to as fixed assets or plant assets, and the amounts spent are part of a corporation's capital expenditures. (Note that land is not depreciated because it is assumed to last indefinitely.)",what
What is the difference between reserve and provision?,"In the U.S. the use of the word reserve has been discouraged for several decades. In its place, the accounting profession has recommended the use of words such as allowance, accumulated, or provision. For instance, many years ago the contra account to a plant asset may have been titled Depreciation Reserve. To some readers, that name implied that cash had been set aside to replace the asset. To better communicate reality, the accounting profession recommended a more descriptive title such as Accumulated Depreciation. Similarly, the contra account to Accounts Receivable may have been titled Reserve for Bad Debts. Again, that title could imply that money was set aside. To avoid misinterpretation, the accounting profession suggested Allowance for Bad Debts or Provision for Bad Debts.
The word provision might appear in the title of a contra account as we just noted. In addition, provision will occasionally appear in the title of an expense account, such as Provision for Income Taxes.",what
How much do you depreciate an asset and when?,"Depreciation begins when you place an asset in service and it ends when you take an asset out of service or when you have expensed its cost, whichever comes first.
For financial statements, you are guided by the matching principle. The objective is to match the cost of the asset to the accounting periods in which revenues were earned by using the asset. There are two estimates needed: 1) the number of years that the asset will be used, and 2) the salvage value at the end of the asset's use. If an asset has a cost of $100,000 and is expected to be used for 10 years and then have no salvage value, most companies will depreciate the asset at the rate of $10,000 per year. This is known as the straight line method of depreciation.
For income tax purposes in the U.S., the Internal Revenue Service has determined the number of years that various assets will be useful and it assumes there will be no salvage value. The IRS also allows companies to take larger depreciation deductions in the earlier years and smaller deductions in the later years of the assets' lives. This is known as accelerated depreciation.
As you probably noted from the above information, in any one year the depreciation expense on the financial statements will be different from the depreciation expense on the income tax return. However, over the life of an asset, the total depreciation expense will be the same. Accountants refer to this as a timing difference.",what
How does the purchase of a new machine affect the profit and loss statement?,"The purchase of a new machine that will be used in a business will affect the profit and loss statement, or income statement, when the machine is placed into service. At that point, depreciation expense will begin and there will likely be other expenses such as wages, maintenance, electricity, and so on.
Since the income statement reports only the expenses that match the revenues during the accounting period, the depreciation expense might be very small in the first accounting period compared to the amount spent for the machine. For example, if the machine is purchased half way into the accounting year and its cost was $300,000, the depreciation for that first accounting period might be only $15,000—assuming it has a 10 year life and no salvage value. In the next accounting period the depreciation expense will be $30,000 under the straight-line method.
If the machine is used by a manufacturer, the depreciation, electricity, and maintenance of the machine will be recorded as manufacturing overhead. This overhead is then assigned to the products and will be held in inventory until the goods are sold. When the products are sold, these overhead costs will be reported on the income statement as part of the cost of goods sold.",what
What causes a reduction in Accumulated Depreciation?,"The balance in the account Accumulated Depreciation will be reduced when an asset that has been depreciated is removed.
When an asset is sold, the depreciation expense is first recorded up to the date of the sale. Then the asset and its accumulated depreciation is removed and the proceeds are recorded.
Here's an example. A company has Equipment of $600,000 and Accumulated Depreciation of $380,000 before an item of equipment is sold. The original cost of the equipment being sold was $50,000. The first step is to record the current period's depreciation on that one item. Let's assume the depreciation will be $500. Let's also assume that after it is recorded, the item's accumulated depreciation will be $40,500. The company receives $5,000 for the equipment. The journal entry to record the disposal will consist of a debit to Cash for $5,000; a debit to Accumulated Depreciation for $40,500; a debit to Loss of Disposal of Asset for $4,500; a credit to Equipment for $50,000.
Prior to this transaction, the balance in the Accumulated Depreciation account was a credit balance of $380,000. The asset's current period depreciation of $500 increased the account's credit balance to $380,500. The disposal of the asset will reduce the balance in Accumulated Depreciation by $40,500 to a new balance of $340,000.",what
Why would a company use double-declining depreciation on its financial statements?,"Most companies will not use the double-declining balance method of depreciation on their financial statements. The reason is that it causes the company's net income in the early years of an asset's life to be lower than it would be under the straight-line method.
One reason for using double-declining balance depreciation on the financial statements is to have a consistent combination of depreciation expense and repairs and maintenance expense during the life of the asset. In other words, in the early years of the asset's life, when the repairs and maintenance expenses are low, the depreciation expense will be high. In the later years of the asset's life, when the repairs and maintenance expenses are high, the depreciation expense will be low. While this seems logical, the company will end up reporting lower net income in the early years of the asset's life (as compared to the use of straight-line depreciation). Most managers will not accept reporting lower net income sooner than required.",what
What is the difference between the terms capitalize and depreciate?,"Capitalize refers to adding an amount to the balance sheet. For example, certain interest from loans to self-construct a building will be added to the cost of the building. The building's cost including the capitalized interest will be recorded as an asset on the balance sheet.
Depreciate refers to reducing an amount reported on the balance sheet. Depreciation is defined as systematically allocating the cost of a plant asset from the balance sheet and reporting it as depreciation expense on the income statement. If the building has a cost of $600,000 and a useful life of 30 years, then (assuming no salvage value and straight-line depreciation) each year $20,000 of cost is removed from the asset section of the balance sheet and will appear on the income statement as depreciation expense. (This in turn reduces owner's equity and keeps the balance sheet in balance.)
The interest on debt that is capitalized will not be expensed during the year of construction. Instead, it is added to the cost of the building (capitalized) and will be part of the annual depreciation expense occurring during the building's 30-year life.
In summary, capitalize means to add an amount to the balance sheet. Depreciate means to systematically remove an amount from the balance sheet during the asset's useful life.",what
What is the fixed asset turnover ratio?,"The fixed asset turnover ratio shows the relationship between the annual net sales and the net amount of fixed assets.
The net amount of fixed assets is the amount of property, plant and equipment reported on the balance sheet after deducting the accumulated depreciation. Ideally, you should use the average amount of net fixed assets during the year of the net sales.
A corporation having property, plant and equipment with an average gross amount of $10 million and an average accumulated depreciation of $4 million would have average net fixed assets of $6 million. If its net sales were $18 million, its fixed asset turnover would be 3 ($18 million of net sales divided by $6 million of average net fixed assets).",what
"Is the cost of land, buildings, and machinery a fixed cost?","Some people refer to land, buildings, and machinery as fixed assets. They are also referred to as plant assets, or as property, plant, and equipment.
The depreciation expense on the buildings and machinery is often viewed as a fixed cost or fixed expense. Hence, in the calculation of the break-even point, the annual depreciation expense on the fixed assets other than land is part of the fixed costs or fixed expenses. There is no depreciation of land.",what
What is depletion?,"Depletion is the movement of the cost of natural resources from a company's balance sheet to its income statements. The objective is to match on the income statement the cost of the natural resources that were sold with the revenues of the natural resources that were sold. The cost of the natural resources sold is referred to as depletion expense.
Conceptually, depletion is similar to the depreciation of property, plant and equipment.",what
"With regard to depreciation, what does the term mid-month convention mean?","In depreciation, the mid-month convention means that an asset placed into service during a given month is assumed to have been placed into service in the middle of that month. For example, if you place a warehouse into service on October 6, you will assume it was placed into service in the middle of October and will record depreciation for half of the month of October. If a building is placed into service on October 23, you will assume it was placed into service in the middle of October and will record depreciation for half of the month of October.
The mid-month convention also applies to the disposal of an asset. This means that an asset that is disposed of on October 25 will be assumed to have been disposed of in the middle of October. If an asset is disposed of on October 3, it is also assumed that the asset was disposed of in the middle of October. In either situation, depreciation will be recorded for half of the month of October.
The mid-month convention is pertinent for the income tax depreciation for certain property.  You can find more on this in the Internal Revenue Service Publication 946.",what
What is an asset's useful life?,"An asset's useful life is the period of time (or total amount of activity) for which the asset will be economically feasible for use in a business. In other words, it is the period of time that the business asset will be in service and used to earn revenues.
Because of the advances in technology, an asset's useful life is often less than its physical life. For example, a computer may be useful for only three years even though it could physically be operated for decades.
The useful life (as well as the salvage value at the end of the useful life) are estimated amounts needed in the calculation of the asset's depreciation. Depreciation is required so that the company's financial statements comply with the matching principle.
In the U.S., income tax regulations specify the useful life that must be used for income tax reporting. This is one reason that in a given year the depreciation on a company's income tax return will not agree with the depreciation reported on its financial statements.",what
"Are depreciation, depletion and amortization similar?","In accounting the terms depreciation, depletion and amortization often involve the movement of costs from the balance sheet to the income statement in a systematic and logical manner.
For example, the systematic expensing of the cost of assets such as buildings, equipment, furnishings and vehicles is known as depreciation. The systematic expensing of the cost of natural resources is referred to as depletion. The systematic expensing of other long-term costs such as bond issue costs and organization costs is referred to as amortization.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization are also described as noncash expenses, since there is no cash outlay in the years that the expense is reported on the income statement. As a result, these expenses are added back to the net income reported in the operating activities section of the statement of cash flows when it is prepared under the indirect method.
The term amortization is also used to indicate the systematic reduction in a loan balance resulting from a predetermined schedule of interest and principal payments.",what
Is it acceptable for companies to use two methods of depreciation?,"Yes, many companies use two or more methods of depreciation.
It is acceptable and common for companies to depreciate its plant assets by using the straight line method on its financial statements, while using an accelerated method on its income tax return.
A company could also be depreciating its equipment over ten years for its financial statements, while using seven years for its income tax return.
Even the depreciation for financial statements could consist of some assets being depreciated using the units of production or units of activity method, while other assets are depreciated using the straight line method.",what
What is the difference between reserve and allowance?,"More than 60 years ago, accountants in the U.S. used Reserve for Bad Debts as the title of the contra account associated with Accounts Receivable or Loans Receivable. They also used Reserve for Depreciation as the title of the contra account associated with plant assets. The use of the word reserve led some readers of the financial statements to conclude that money was set aside for replacing plant assets or the uncollectible accounts or loans. To avoid this misunderstanding, the accounting profession recommended that the word reserve have a very limited use. Accountants now use Allowance for Doubtful Accounts or Allowance for Bad Debts instead of Reserve for Bad Debts. In the case of plant assets, Accumulated Depreciation is used in place of Reserve for Depreciation.",what
What is accelerated depreciation?,"Accelerated depreciation is the allocation of a plant asset's cost in a faster manner than the straight line depreciation. Compared to straight line depreciation, accelerated depreciation will mean 1) more depreciation in the earlier years of an asset's life and 2) less depreciation in the later years of the asset's life. [Note that the total amount of depreciation over the asset's life will be the same regardless of the depreciation method used.] Hence, the difference between accelerated depreciation and straight line depreciation is the timing of the depreciation.
Three examples of accelerated depreciation methods include double-declining (200% declining) balance, 150% declining balance, and sum-of-the-years' digits (SYD).
The U.S. income tax regulations allow a business to use accelerated depreciation on its income tax return while using straight line depreciation on its financial statements. For profitable corporations this will likely result in deferred income tax payments being reported on its financial statements.",what
What is the net book value of a noncurrent asset?,"The net book value of a noncurrent asset is the net amount reported on the balance sheet for a long-term asset.
To illustrate net book value, let's assume that several years ago a company purchased equipment to be used in its business. The equipment's cost was $100,000 and its accumulated depreciation as of its recent balance sheet date was $40,000. This means that up to the balance sheet date $40,000 of the asset's cost had been reported as Depreciation Expense. It also means that the equipment's net book value is $60,000 ($100,000 of cost minus $40,000 of accumulated depreciation). Net book value or simply book value indicates that $60,000 of the noncurrent asset's cost has not yet been charged to depreciation expense.
Net book value or book value can also be associated with noncurrent assets other than fixed assets. Two examples include long-term investments and unamortized bond issue costs.",what
Can a fully depreciated asset be revalued?,"A fully depreciated asset cannot be revalued because of accounting's cost principle.
Definition of a Fully Depreciated Asset
A fully depreciated asset is one that has accumulated depreciation equal to its cost. Hence, the book value of the asset is $0. Once an asset is fully depreciated, there will be no additional depreciation expense.
Example of a Fully Depreciated Asset
Let's assume that a company purchased a building more than 30 years ago at a cost of $600,000. The company then depreciated the building at a rate of $20,000 per year for 30 years. Today the building continues to be used by the company and it plans to continue using it for many more years. The company's current balance sheet will report the building at its cost of $600,000 minus its accumulated depreciation of $600,000 (a book value of $0) even if the building's current market value is $2,000,000.
Unless there are improvements to the building, there will be no depreciation expense after the 30th year.",what
What would cause a decrease in accumulated depreciation?,"A decrease in accumulated depreciation will occur when an asset is sold, scrapped, or retired. At that point, the asset's accumulated depreciation and its cost are removed from the accounts. (The net of these two amounts—known as the book value or carrying value—is then compared to the proceeds to determine if there is a gain or loss on the disposal.)
Some accounting textbooks state that the cost of an expenditure that extends the useful life of an asset should be debited to the accumulated depreciation account instead of the asset account. Such an entry will also reduce the credit balance in the accumulated depreciation account.",what
What is the meaning of systematic and rational allocation?,"Systematic and rational allocation is a phrase often cited in the definition of depreciation. In that context it means that the annual depreciation expense should be based on a formula that is logical and acceptable to other unbiased accountants.
For example, depreciating an asset over a 10-year period with the same amount of depreciation expense each year is systematic and rational. Depreciating the asset on the basis of the number of parts it produces is also systematic and rational. However, determining the annual depreciation expense based on each year's profits is not systematic and rational.
Systematic and rational allocations provide for objectivity and consistency, which are important characteristics of accounting.",what
Is depreciation an operating expense?,"Depreciation Could Be Either an Operating Expense or a Non-operating Expense
Depreciation is an operating expense if the asset being depreciated is used in an organization's main operating activities.
Depreciation is a non-operating expense if the asset being depreciated is used in a peripheral or incidental activity of an organization.
Examples of When Depreciation is an Operating Expense
Examples of depreciation being reported as part of the operating expenses on the income statement include:

Depreciation of a retailer's store displays, warehouse equipment, delivery truck, and buildings used in its selling and general administrative functions. The depreciation will be reported on the retailer's income statement in the section containing its SG&A expenses.
Depreciation of the equipment and building used in the manufacturer's selling and general administrative functions. This depreciation will be reported on the manufacturer's income statement in the section containing its SG&A expenses.
Depreciation of equipment and building used in the manufacturing of products. This depreciation will be allocated to the goods produced and is considered part of a product's indirect costs. In the period in which a product is sold, its cost (including its share of depreciation) will be reported as part of the cost of goods sold, which is likely to be the largest operating expense on a manufacturer's income statement.",what
Why would the cost behavior change outside of the relevant range of activity?,"Cost behavior often changes outside of the relevant range of activity due to a change in the fixed costs. When volume increases to a certain point, more fixed costs will have to be added. When volume shrinks significantly, some fixed costs could be eliminated.
Here's an illustration. A company manufactures products in its 100,000 square foot plant. The company's depreciation on the plant is $1,000,000 per year. The capacity of the plant is 500,000 units of output and its normal output is 400,000 units per year. When the company is manufacturing between 300,000 and 500,000 units, it needs salaried managers earning $400,000 per year. Below 300,000 units of output, some of the salaried manager positions would be eliminated. Above 500,000 units, the company will need to add plant space and managers.
For this example, the relevant range is between 300,000 units and 500,000 units of output per year. In that range the total of the two fixed costs is $1,400,000 per year. Below 300,000 units, the fixed costs will drop to less than $1,400,000 because some salaries will be eliminated and some of the space might be rented. When the volume exceeds 500,000 units per year, the company will need to add fixed costs because of the additional space and the additional managers. Perhaps the total fixed costs will be $2,000,000 for output between 500,000 units and 700,000 units.",what
Are repairs to office equipment an expense?,"Repairing and maintaining office equipment is an immediate expense. This is true even if the repair cost is a very large amount.
If a large expenditure is made to improve office equipment, that cost would be recorded as an asset and then depreciated over the remaining life of the equipment.
Small expenditures to improve office equipment are usually expensed immediately because of the materiality concept. This means the amount is so small that no one will be misled by having the entire amount appear immediately as an expense rather than appearing as depreciation expense over several years. Often improvements of less than $500 or $1,000 are considered immaterial and are expensed immediately.",what
What is capex?,"Capex is a shortened form of the term capital expenditure or capital expenditures. Capex is often used when referring to:

 the actual amounts that were spent during a recent accounting period for additions to property, plant and equipment, and/or
 the planned amounts that will be spent for future additions to property, plant and equipment

The total capex amount that was spent in a recent accounting period is reported in the statement of cash flows within the section described as investing activities. Since the capex amount is an outflow of cash, it is reported as a negative amount.
The planned capex amounts will likely be contained in a company's internal document referred to as the capital expenditures budget (or capex budget).
Many financial analysts also subtract the capex amount from the company's cash from operating activities to arrive at the company's free cash flow.
Most of the capex items will be depreciated over the years of their useful life. This means the capex amount will likely be spread over many income statements in the form of Depreciation Expense and/or as part of a manufacturer's cost of goods sold.",what
What is accounting for price level changes?,"In 1979 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued its Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 33 entitled Financial Reporting and Changing Prices. (You will find the original Statement No. 33 on www.FASB.org.) In short, Statement No. 33 required large companies to report supplementary information on the effects of changing prices on its inventory and its property, plant and equipment. (In the late 1970's the U.S. was experiencing double-digit inflation rates and the SEC was advocating the reporting of replacement cost.)
One disclosure required by Statement 33 was the reporting of the effects of general inflation as indicated by the change in the consumer price index. In other words, a large company had to disclose in the notes to its financial statements some key amounts after adjusting inventory and property, plant and equipment amounts for the changes in the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar. The second disclosure reported the effects of the changes in the specific prices of inventory and property, plant and equipment.
In 1986 the FASB issued its Statement No. 89 which no longer required the reporting of the information. As a result, most companies stopped the calculations and reporting. Two of the factors in deciding to stop the calculations was the lack of use by financial analysts and a decline in the rates of inflation in the U.S. In other words, the accounting for price level changes failed to pass the cost/benefit test.",what
How do I record exterior cement work? Is it an asset or an expense?,"If the cement work was done to repair or maintain existing cement work, then the expenditure should be recorded as an expense. Even if the cost is very large, repairs and maintenance must be expensed. The cost of repairs or maintenance cannot be recorded as an asset.
If the cement work is an addition or an improvement (more than repairing or maintaining existing cement work), the cost of the cement work is viewed as a new asset. If the amount is significant, you should record the expenditure as an asset and then depreciate the cost over the useful life. However, if the amount of the addition or the improvement is relatively small, the accounting concept of materiality allows you to expense the entire amount immediately.",what
Are income taxes affected by accelerated depreciation?,"Using accelerated depreciation on the income tax return will mean greater depreciation expense and smaller taxable income in the earlier years of an asset's life. However, it will be followed by smaller depreciation expense and greater taxable income in the later years of the asset's life.
For a corporation with consistent taxable income, the use of accelerated depreciation on the income tax return instead of the straight-line method, will defer some income tax until the later years of an asset's life. Over the entire life of the asset, the total depreciation expense is the same. The methods merely affect the timing of the depreciation.
It is also important to note that a corporation may use the straight-line method on its financial statements and at the same time use accelerated depreciation on its income tax returns. The differences in income taxes resulting from using different methods are referred to as timing differences or temporary differences.
You can learn more about the reporting of income taxes caused by timing and temporary differences by reading the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, available at www.FASB.org/st.",what
What is illusory profit?,"Illusory profit, also called phantom profit, is the difference between 1) the profit reported using historical costs required by US GAAP, and 2) the profit computed using replacement costs. Illusory profit is greatest during periods of rising costs at companies with significant amounts of inventory and plant assets.
For example, when inventory is measured by using the first-in, first-out cost flow assumption under US GAAP, the actual historical cost of inventory that is charged to the cost of goods sold during periods of rising costs is smaller than the amount computed using replacement costs. This smaller amount of costs charged to the income statement means reporting greater profit. The difference in the profit is said to be illusory.
In the case of plant assets used during periods of rising costs, the depreciation expense reported on the income statement based on historical costs (required by US GAAP) will be less than the depreciation computed by using the higher replacement cost of the plant assets. The additional profit from this difference in depreciation is considered to be illusory profit.",what
Kindly illustrate various depreciation methods.,"I will illustrate the following methods of depreciation: straight-line, units of production, double-declining balance, and sum of the years' digits. These methods can be used for financial reporting. (The depreciation methods for income tax purposes are not illustrated.)
Let's assume that a plant asset has a cost of $100,000 with an estimated salvage value of $10,000. This makes the depreciable cost $90,000. The asset has a useful life of 5 years or the production of 100,000 parts. The asset is placed into service on January 1, 2012 and the company's accounting year is January 1 through December 31.
Straight-line: Depreciable cost of $90,000 divided by 5 years = $18,000 of depreciation each year for 5 years. Download our Straight-line Form and Template.
Units of production: Depreciable cost of $90,000 divided by 100,000 parts = $0.90 per part. In 2012 the company produces 12,000 parts X $0.90 = $10,800 of depreciation. In 2013 the company produces 30,000 parts X $0.90 = $27,000 of depreciation. Continue until accumulated depreciation reaches $90,000. Download our Units of Activity (Production) Form and Template.
Double-declining balance: Straight-line depreciation rate is 20% (100% divided by 5 years). Double the straight-line rate is 40% (20% X 2). This rate is applied to the book value of the asset at the beginning of each year. (Book value is cost minus accumulated depreciation.) For the year 2012 the double-declining balance depreciation is: beginning book value of $100,000 X 40% = $40,000. In 2013 the calculation is: beginning book value of $60,000 X 40% = $24,000. Continue until the accumulated depreciation reaches $90,000. Download our Double Declining Balance Form and Template.
Sum of the years' digits: Add the digits in the years of useful life: 5+4+3+2+1 = 15. In the first year (2012) multiply 5/15 times the depreciable cost of $90,000 = $30,000 of depreciation. In 2013 multiply 4/15 times $90,000 = $24,000. In 2014 multiply 3/15 times $90,000, and so on.",what
Why is it necessary to allocate a lump sum payment to individual items?,"It is necessary to allocate a lump sum payment to individual items in order to record a fair portion of the lump sum in each of the proper general ledger accounts.
For instance, let's assume that a corporation made a lump sum payment of $450,000 in order to acquire a building, the land on which the building sits, and also some equipment. The lump sum payment means that the total cost of $450,000 has to be allocated among three general ledger accounts: Land, Buildings, and Equipment. The allocation must be done in a logical manner for the following reasons:

the portion of the lump sum cost that is recorded in the Land account will not be depreciated
the portion of the lump sum cost that is recorded in the Buildings account might be depreciated over a 25-year period, and
the portion of the lump sum cost that is recorded in the Equipment account might be depreciated over 7 years.",what
Does a company have to use the IRS years of useful life for depreciation?,"For the company's financial statements, the economic life of the asset should be used—not the years of useful life required for income tax purposes. In other words, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) might stipulate that certain equipment is to be depreciated on the income tax return over 7 years. However, the company knows that the equipment will be useful in producing revenues for 10 years. Accounting's matching principle requires that the company's financial statements match the equipment's costs to its revenues over a 10-year period. (This will result in the most accurate measurement of the company's accounting net income.) However, on the tax return the company must follow the IRS rules and will depreciate the asset over 7 years. Obviously, this will result in two sets of depreciation amounts. (Further, the company's financial statements can use straight-line depreciation over the 10 years while the income tax return is using an accelerated method of depreciation over the 7 years.)
The difference in each year's depreciation is referred to as a timing difference. The reason is that over the life of the equipment, the total amount of depreciation expense is likely to be the same. It is just a matter of timing as to when that total amount is reported on the financial statements versus the income tax returns.",what
"If cash and a note are exchanged for a plant asset, is the amount of the note used in the depreciation calculation?","A plant asset's cost is depreciated, unless the asset is land.
Cost is defined as the cash or cash equivalent amount at the time of the transaction. This means that the asset's cost is the cash amount plus the note's present value at time that the asset is purchased.
To illustrate this, let's assume that equipment is purchased by giving $50,000 of cash plus a promissory note of $100,000. If the note has an interest rate that is a fair rate considering the market rates and the riskiness of the party signing the note, then the present value of the note is $100,000. The equipment will then be recorded at its cost of $150,000. This cost of $150,000 will be depreciated over the equipment's useful life.
If the note specifies zero interest, then the present value of the note is less than $100,000. Let's assume that the note's present value is computed to be $90,000. This means that the asset's cost will be $140,000—the cash of $50,000 plus the note's $90,000 of present value. Assuming no salvage value, the total depreciation expense over the life of the equipment will equal $140,000. The $10,000 difference will be reported as interest expense over the life of the note.",what
How do you calculate the payback period?,"Definition of Payback Period
The payback period is the expected number of years it will take for a company to recoup the cash it invested in a project.
Examples of Payback Periods
Let's assume that a company invests cash of $400,000 in more efficient equipment. The cash savings from the new equipment is expected to be $100,000 per year for 10 years. The payback period is expected to be 4 years ($400,000 divided by $100,000 per year).
A second project requires a cash investment of $200,000 and it generates cash as follows:

Year 1: $20,000
Year 2: $60,000
Year 3: $80,000
Year 4: $100,000
Year 5: $70,000

The payback period is 3.4 years ($20,000 + $60,000 + $80,000 = $160,000 in the first three years + $40,000 of the $100,000 occurring in Year 4).
Note that the payback calculation uses cash flows, not net income. Also, the payback calculation does not address a project's total profitability over its entire life, nor are the cash flows discounted for the time value of money.",what
What is financial leverage?,"Definition of Financial Leverage
Financial leverage which is also known as leverage or trading on equity, refers to the use of debt to acquire additional assets.
The use of financial leverage to control a greater amount of assets (by borrowing money) will cause the returns on the owner's cash investment to be amplified. That is, with financial leverage:

an increase in the value of the assets will result in a larger gain on the owner's cash, when the loan interest rate is less than the rate of increase in the asset's value
a decrease in the value of the assets will result in a larger loss on the owner's cash

Examples of Financial Leverage
Mary uses $500,000 of her cash to purchase 40 acres of land with a total cost of $500,000. Mary is not using financial leverage.
Sue uses $500,000 of her cash and borrows $1,000,000 to purchase 120 acres of land having a total cost of $1,500,000. Sue is using financial leverage to own/control $1,500,000 of property with only $500,000 of her own money. Let's also assume that the interest on Sue's loan is $50,000 per year and it is paid at the beginning of each year.
Effects of Using Financial Leverage
For our examples let's assume that after one year, the land owned by Mary and the land owned by Sue increased in value by 20% and both Mary and Sue sold their land investments at the market values. As a result:

Mary's land will sell for $600,000 which results in a gain of $100,000 (selling price of $600,000 minus the land's cost of $500,000). The $100,000 gain on Mary's cash of $500,000 results in a gain of 20% on Mary's $100,000 
Sue's land will sell for $1,800,000 which results in a gain of $250,000 (selling price of $1,800,000 minus $1,550,000, which is the land's cost of $1,500,000 and interest of $50,000). The $250,000 gain on Sue's $550,000 of cash is a gain of 45% instead of a gain of 20% without the use of leverage

Now let's assume that after one year, the land owned by Mary and and the land owned by Sue decreased in value by 20% and that both Mary and Sue sold their land investments at the market values. As a result:

Mary's land will sell for $400,000 which means a $100,000 loss on the land's cost of $500,000. The $100,000 loss on Mary's cash of $500,000 results in a 20% loss on Mary's money
Sue's land will sell for $1,200,000 which results in a loss of $350,000 (selling price of $1,200,000 minus the land's cost of $1,500,000 and interest of $50,000). The $350,000 loss on Sue's cash of $550,000 results in a 63.6% loss on Sue's money instead of a loss of 20% without the use of leverage",what
What is cost accounting?,"Definition of Cost Accounting
Cost accounting is involved with the following:

Determining the costs of products, processes, projects, etc. in order to report the correct amounts on a company's financial statements, and
Assisting management in the planning and control of the organization
Preparing special analyses that assists in making the best decisions

Examples of Cost Accounting
A significant part of cost accounting involves the unit cost of a manufacturer's products in order to report the cost of inventory on its balance sheet and the cost of goods sold on its income statement. This is achieved with techniques such as the allocation of manufacturing overhead costs and through the use of process costing, operations costing, and job-order costing systems.
Cost accounting assists management to plan and control the business through budgeting for operations, capital budgeting for expanding operations, standard costing and the reporting of variances, transfer pricing, etc.
Special analyses includes cost behavior, cost-volume-profit relationships, make or buy decisions, selling prices for products, activity-based costing, and more.
Cost accounting had its roots in manufacturing businesses. However, today it extends to service businesses. For example, a bank will use cost accounting to determine the cost of processing a customer's check and/or a deposit, maintaining a checking account, processing international wire transfers, servicing a mortgage loan, etc. This in turn may provide management with guidance in the pricing of various services.",what
What is capital budgeting?,"Definition of Capital Budgeting
Capital budgeting is a process used by companies for evaluating and ranking potential capital expenditures or investments that are significant in amount. A few examples of capital expenditures include:

Purchase of new equipment
Rebuilding existing equipment
Purchasing delivery vehicles
Constructing additions to buildings

Examples of Capital Budgeting Calculations
Capital budgeting usually involves the following calculations for each project:

Future accounting profit by period
Future cash flows by period
Present value of the cash flows by discounting them with an appropriate interest rate
The number of years it takes for a project's cash flow to pay back the initial cash investment
An assessment of risk along with the urgency of the project",what
What is the difference between stockholder and stakeholder?,"Definition of Stockholder
A stockholder or shareholder is the owner of shares of a corporation's common or preferred stock.
Definition of Stakeholder
A stakeholder is anyone that has an interest or is affected by a corporation or other organization. In other words, a stockholder isn't the only party having a stake in the corporation. 
Examples of Stakeholders
The stakeholders in a corporation include its: stockholders, creditors, employees, families of the employees, suppliers, customers, community, and others.
A example of an organization that does not have stockholders is a state university. Even though it does not have stockholders, the university will have the following stakeholders: students, students' families, alumni, professors, administrators, businesses, state taxpayers, the local community, the state community, society in general, custodians, suppliers, etc.",what
What is NPV?,"Definition of NPV
NPV is the acronym for net present value, which can be calculated as follows:

The present value of the future cash inflows
Minus the cash investment

Example of NPV
Assume that a company makes a cash investment of $500,000 in a project that is expected to provide future cash inflows of $100,000 at the end of each year for 10 years.
The future cash receipts of $100,000 at the end of each year for 10 years needs to be discounted to their present value. If the future cash amounts are discounted by 14% per year compounded annually (the company's required return), it will result in a present value of approximately $522,000.
The $522,000 of present value coming in minus the $500,000 of present value going out results is a positive net present value of $22,000. In other words, the company will earn slightly more than 14% per year on its $500,000 investment.",what
What is the difference between Present Value (PV) and Net Present Value (NPV)?,"Definition of Present Value (PV)
Present value or PV is the result of discounting one or more future amounts to the present. The greater the discount rate, the smaller the present value.
Examples of Present Value
A cash amount of $10,000 received at the end of 5 years will have a present value (PV) of $6,210 when the $10,000 is discounted at 10% compounded annually. If the $10,000 is discounted at 12% compounded annually, the present value will be $5,670.
Definition of Net Present Value (NPV)
Net present value is the result of discounting all of the cash inflows and outflows and then combining all of their present values. This means that the original outflow (often the investment made at the present time) is a deduction from the other present values.
A positive net present value indicates that an investment is earning more than the discount rate. A negative net present value indicates an investment is earning less than the discount rate, but may be earning a positive rate. For example, if the cash flows are discounted by 12%, a slightly negative NPV could mean that the investment is earning 11%. 
Examples of Net Present Value
Assume that an investment of $5,000 today will result in one cash receipt of $10,000 at the end of 5 years. If the investor requires a 10% annual return compounded annually, the net present value (NPV) of the investment is $1,210. This is the result of combining the present value of the cash inflow $6,210 (from the example above) and the $5,000 (which is the present of the $5,000 paid today).
Assuming the same information, except that the rate for discounting the cash amounts is 12%, the net present value (NPV) is $670. This is the $5,670 present value of the cash inflow combined with the present value of the $5,000 cash outflow.",what
What are fixed assets?,"Definition of Fixed Assets
Fixed assets are a company's tangible, noncurrent assets that are used in its business operations. The word fixed  indicates that these assets will not be used up, consumed, or sold in the current accounting year.
A company's fixed assets are reported in the noncurrent (or long-term) asset section of the balance sheet in the section described as property, plant and equipment. The fixed assets except for land will be depreciated and their accumulated depreciation will also be reported under property, plant and equipment.
Examples of Fixed Assets
Some of a manufacturer's fixed assets include:

Land, land improvements, buildings
Machinery and equipment
Trucks, automobiles
Furniture and fixtures
Computer systems",what
What is hurdle rate?,"Definition of Hurdle Rate
In capital budgeting, the term hurdle rate is the minimum rate that a company wants to earn when investing in a project. Therefore, the hurdle rate is also referred to as the company's required rate of return or target rate. For a company to further consider a project, its internal rate of return must equal or exceed the hurdle rate.
The hurdle rate is also used to discount a project's future cash flows to its net present value.
Example of Hurdle Rate
The absolute minimum hurdle rate should be the company's cost of capital (a blend of the cost of debt and the cost of equity). However, the hurdle rate is usually larger than the cost of capital when the company has many investment opportunities and for projects that have a higher level of risk.",what
"In accounting, what is meant by relevant costs?","Relevant costs are those costs that will make a difference in a decision. Relevant costs are future costs that will differ among alternatives.
We can demonstrate relevant costs with the following situation. A company is deciding whether or not to eliminate a product line. The product line accounts for approximately 4% of the company's activities. If the product line is eliminated, the officers of the corporation will continue to receive the same salaries and the central office expenses will not change. The product line managers and other employees working directly on the product line will be terminated. Hence, their salaries will be eliminated.
The salaries of the product line managers and other employees whose salaries will be eliminated are relevant to the decision. If these salaries are $700,000 with the product line and $0 without the product line, the $700,000 of savings is relevant. Those cost savings and other possible cost savings will be considered along with the loss of sales revenues.
On the other hand, the officers' salaries are not relevant in the decision. In other words, it doesn't matter if the officers' salaries are $500,000 or $5,000,000. The officers' salaries will be the same with or without the product line. Similarly, the decision maker does not need to know the amount of its central office expenses, since they will be the same with or without the product line. Expenses from previous years are also irrelevant.
To recap, relevant costs are the future costs that will differ among alternatives. You might use the past costs to help you predict those future costs, but the past costs are otherwise irrelevant to the decision. Accountants refer to the past costs as sunk costs.",what
What is trading on equity?,"Definition of Trading on Equity
Trading on equity, which is also referred to as financial leverage, occurs when a corporation uses bonds, other debt, and preferred stock to increase its earnings on its common stock. 
Example of Trading on Equity
To illustrate trading on equity, let's assume that a corporation uses long term debt to purchase assets that are expected to earn more than the interest on the debt. The earnings in excess of the interest expense on the new debt will increase the earnings of the corporation's common stockholders. The increase in earnings indicates that the corporation was successful in trading on equity. If the newly purchased assets earn less than the interest expense on the new debt, the earnings of the common stockholders will decrease.
There is a limit to the proportion of debt that can be added before the corporation's financial future is jeopardized.",what
What is the cost of capital?,"Definition of Cost of Capital
The cost of capital is the weighted-average, after-tax cost of a corporation's long-term debt, preferred stock (if any), and the stockholders' equity associated with common stock.
The cost of capital is expressed as a percentage and it is often used to compute the net present value of the cash flows in a proposed investment. It is also considered to be the minimum after-tax internal rate of return to be earned on new investments.
For a profitable U.S. corporation, the costs of bonds and other long-term loans are usually the least expensive components of the cost of capital. One reason is that the interest is deductible for income taxes. For example, a corporation paying 6% on its loans may have an after-tax cost of 4% when its combined federal and state income tax rate is 33%. On the other hand, the dividends paid on the corporation's preferred and common stock are not tax deductible.
The cost of common stock (paid-in capital and retained earnings) is considered to be the most expensive component of the cost of capital because of the risks involved.
Example of Cost of Capital
Assume that a corporation has the following:

$40 million of long-term debt with an after-tax cost of 4%
$10 million of 7% preferred stock
$50 million of common stock and retained earnings with an estimated cost of 15%

The corporation's weighted-average, after-tax cost of capital is:

Long-term debt cost of $1.6 million ($40 million X 4%)
Preferred stock cost of $0.7 million ($10 million X 7%)
Common stock cost of $7.5 million ($50 million X 15%)
Equals a total cost of $9.8 million which divided by $100 million is 9.8%",what
What is managerial accounting?,"Definition of Managerial Accounting
Managerial accounting is also known as management accounting and it includes many of the topics that are included in cost accounting.
Some of the managerial topics involve the computation of a manufacturer's product costs that are needed for the external financial statements which must comply with US GAAP. Other topics involve analyses and reports that are not distributed outside of the company but are used by management in its decision making and in the planning and control of the business operations.
Examples of Managerial Accounting Topics
Managerial accounting topics often include:

Job order costing
Process costing
Absorption costing vs. variable costing
Understanding cost behavior and cost-volume-profit analysis
Operational budgeting
Standard costing and variance analysis
Activity based costing
Pricing of individual products and services
Analyzing the profitability of product lines, customers, territories, etc.
Capital budgeting
Ratio analysis",what
"What is the difference between residual value, salvage value, and scrap value?","The terms residual value, salvage value, and scrap value are often used when referring to the estimated value that is expected at the end of the useful life of the property, plant and equipment used in a business. This estimated amount is used to calculate the asset's depreciation expense and it is often assumed to be zero.
The term residual value may have other uses as well. For example, it is used when discussing leased assets.",what
What are marketable securities?,"Marketable securities are unrestricted financial instruments which can be readily sold on a stock exchange or bond exchange. Marketable securities are often classified into two groups: marketable equity securities and marketable debt securities.
Marketable equity securities include shares of common stock and most preferred stock which are traded on a stock exchange and for which there are quoted market prices.
Marketable debt securities include government bonds and corporate bonds which are traded on a bond exchange and for which there are quoted market prices.",what
What is a non-discount method in capital budgeting?,"A non-discount method of capital budgeting does not explicitly consider the time value of money. In other words, each dollar earned in the future is assumed to have the same value as each dollar that was invested many years earlier. The payback method is one of the techniques used in capital budgeting that does not consider the time value of money.
The payback method simply computes the number of years it will take for an investment to return cash equal to the amount invested. For example, if an investment of $100,000 is made and it generates cash of $50,000 for two years followed by $10,000 per year for four additional years, its payback is two years ($50,000 + $50,000). If another investment of $100,000 generates cash of $20,000 per year for two years and then provides cash of $40,000 per year for six additional years, its payback is approximately 3.5 years ($20,000 + $20,000 + $40,000 + 0.5 times $40,000).
As you can see in the examples, payback only answers one question: How long before the cash invested is returned? Payback does not address which investment is more profitable. Payback not only ignored the time value of money, it ignored all of the cash received after the payback period.
The accounting rate of return or return on investment (ROI) are two more examples of methods used in capital budgeting that does not involve discounting future cash amounts.
To overcome the shortcomings of payback, accounting rate of return, and return on investment, capital budgeting should include techniques that consider the time value of money. Two of these methods include (1) the net present value method, and (2) the internal rate of return calculation. Under these techniques, the future cash flows are discounted. This means that each dollar in the distant future will be less valuable than each dollar in the near future, and both of these will have less value than each dollar invested in the present.",what
What is a rolling budget?,"A rolling budget is also known as a continuous budget, a perpetual budget, or a rolling horizon budget. We will use the following example to explain the meaning of a rolling budget.
Let's assume that a company's accounting year ends on each December 31. Prior to the start of the year 2013, the company prepares its annual budget which is detailed by month for January through December 2013. This budget could become a rolling budget if after January 2013 the company drops the budget for January 2013 and adds the budget for January 2014. This rolling budget now covers the one year, or 12-month, period of February 1, 2013 through January 31, 2014. At the end of February 2013, the rolling budget will drop February 2013 and will add February 2014. At this point the rolling budget will cover the one year period of March 1, 2013 through February 29, 2014.
The benefit of a rolling budget is that the company's management will always have a budget that looks forward for one full year.
A rolling budget could use 3-month periods or quarters instead of months. Also, a company might have a 5-year rolling budget for capital expenditures. In this case a full year will be added to replace the year that has just ended. This 5-year rolling budget means that management will always have a 5-year planning horizon.",what
What are some of the methods for evaluating capital expenditures?,"Some capital expenditures are selected out of necessity, such as a government requirement to change the system for discharging environmentally harmful vapors or to comply with an OSHA requirement. After budgeting for the required capital expenditures, companies might use the following techniques for evaluating other capital expenditures.
Payback. This calculates the number of years it will take to recoup the cash spent on a project. A criticism of payback is that the time value of money is not considered and the cash flows over the entire life of the project are not considered.
Accounting Rate of Return or Return on Investment. This approach looks at the increase in accounting profit compared to the increased investment. This approach also ignores the time value of money.
Internal rate of return. This method does consider the time value of money and looks at the cash flows over the entire life of the project. The technique computes the rate that will discount the future cash flows to be equal to the cash outlay for the project.
Net present value. This method discounts the project's future cash flows by a predetermined rate, such as the targeted or needed rate. If the cash flows discounted by the targeted rate exceed the cash investment, the project is accepted. That is, the project provides the targeted return or more.",what
Why does the fixed cost per unit change?,"Fixed costs such as rent or a supervisor's salary will not change in total within a reasonable range of volume or activity. For example, the rent might be $2,500 per month and the supervisor's salary might be $3,500 per month. This total fixed cost of $6,000 per month will be the same whether the volume is 3,000 units or 4,000 units.
On the other hand, the fixed cost per unit will change as the level of volume or activity changes. Using the amounts above, the fixed cost per unit is $2 when the volume is 3,000 units ($6,000 divided by 3,000 units). When the volume is 4,000 units, the fixed cost per unit is $1.50 ($6,000 divided by 4,000 units).",what
What are out-of-pocket costs?,"Out-of-pocket costs are those costs or expenses that require a cash payment in the current period or during a project.
For example, the wages of the person setting up a machine for a new production run are an out-of-pocket cost. However, the cost of the lost opportunity to be producing profitable output during the setup time is not an out-of-pocket cost. (The cost of not earning profits during the setup time, known as an opportunity cost, is often far greater than the out-of-pocket costs.)
Another example of out-of-pocket costs are the current year's repairs and maintenance expenses on a church that was constructed 15 years ago. However, the current depreciation expense on the church is not an out-of-pocket cost. The current period's depreciation is also referred to as a noncash expense.",what
How do I calculate IRR and NPV?,"The internal rate of return (IRR) and the net present value (NPV) are both discounted cash flow techniques or models. This means that each of these techniques looks at two things: 1) the current and future cash inflows and outflows (rather than the accrual accounting income amounts), and 2) the time at which the cash inflows and outflows occur. In other words, these models consider the time value of money: a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in one year, a dollar received in three years is more valuable than a dollar received in five years, and so on.
The internal rate of return or IRR is the rate that will discount all cash inflows and outflows to a net present value of $0. In other words, the IRR model provides you with the true, effective interest rate being earned on a project after taking into consideration the time periods when the various cash amounts are flowing in or out. If you use present value tables to calculate the internal rate of return, it will require some trial and error or iterations to determine the exact rate the project is earning. Software or some financial calculators will provide a quicker and more accurate answer.
The net present value (NPV) discounts all of the cash inflows and outflows by a specified interest rate. The net amount of all of the discounted amounts is the net present value. If the net present value is $0, the project is expected to earn exactly the specified rate. If the net present value is a positive amount, the project will be earning more than the specified interest rate. A negative net present value means the project is expected to earn less than the specified interest rate.",what
What is disinvestment?,"In business, disinvestment means to sell off certain assets such as a manufacturing plant, a division or subsidiary, or product line. Disinvestment is sometimes described as the opposite of capital expenditures. Some people use the term divestiture, or to divest when discussing disinvestment.
For example, an electric generator manufacturer might sell off its consumer generator product lines and manufacturing facilities in order to raise money that can be used to expand its industrial generator product line.
Another example is a consumer products company selling off a profitable division that no longer meets its long range goals. The proceeds from this disinvestment are then used to improve the company's financial position by reducing its debt.",what
What is the difference between break-even point and payback period?,"Break-even point is the volume of sales or services that will result in no net income or net loss on a company's income statement. In other words, the break-even point focuses on the revenues needed to equal exactly all of the expenses on a single income statement prepared under the accrual method of accounting.
The break-even point in dollars of revenues can be calculated by dividing a company's total fixed expenses by its contribution margin ratio. The break-even calculation assumes that the selling prices, contribution margin ratio, and fixed expenses will not change.
Payback period is the number of years needed for a company to receive net cash inflows that aggregate to the amount of an initial cash investment. Hence the payback period focuses on the pertinent cash flows of multiple accounting years instead of the net income of a single accounting period. The payback period is often computed when evaluating potential capital expenditures. However, the payback period is considered to be flawed because it ignores 1) the cash flows occurring after the payback period, and 2) the time value of money.
AccountingCoach PRO contains a cost and managerial accounting exam with 520 questions (with answers) to learn or review topics such as break-even.",what
What is decentralization?,"Decentralization refers to a company's top management delegating authority to subunits of the company. Subunits include divisions, subsidiaries, profit centers, investment centers, and so on.
The extent of decentralization varies. For example, a profit center is likely to have authority to make decisions involving revenues and expenses, but will not have authority to make investment decisions or enter into banking relationships.
A benefit of decentralization is having the decision makers closer to the markets in order to make better and faster decisions. Another benefit of decentralization is having more individuals share the work involved in decision making. This in turn provides excellent training and development of future leaders of the company.
A disadvantage of decentralization occurs if a subunit makes a decision that is good for the subunit's financial results, but it means less than optimal results for the company as a whole.",what
What is the time value of money?,"Definition of Time Value of Money
The time value of money recognizes that receiving cash today is more valuable than receiving cash in the future. The reason is that the cash received today can be invested immediately and begin growing in value. For instance, if a company receives $1,000 today and is able to invest the amount immediately at a rate of 10% per year, the company will have $1,100 after 365 days.
If the time value of money is 10%, it also means that receiving $1,100 in one year is comparable to receiving $1,000 today. Accountants will state that the future value of $1,100 has a present value of $1,000. The difference of $100 will become interest income as over the 365 days that the company waits for the cash.
Time Value of Money | Practical Example
Let's assume that a company provides consulting services today and agrees to an $11,000 payment one year later. The $11,000 represents:

an amount for the services performed today, and
interest to compensate the company for waiting 365 days for the $11,000

Under the accrual basis of accounting and a time value of money of 10%, the service revenues that were earned today are $10,000. The difference of $1,000 will be reported as interest income over the 365 days that the company waits for the $11,000.
Importance of the Time Value of Money in Accounting
The time value of money is important in accounting because of the accountant's cost principle and revenue recognition principle. However, the concepts of materiality and cost/benefit allow the accountants to ignore the time value of money for the routine accounts receivable and accounts payable having credit terms of 30 or 60 days.",what
What is yield to maturity?,"Yield to maturity is the total return that will be earned by someone who purchases a bond and holds it until its maturity date. The yield to maturity might also be referred to as yield, internal rate of return, or the market interest rate at the time that the bond was purchased by the investor. The yield to maturity is expressed as an annual percentage rate.
To illustrate, let's assume that a 5% $100,000 bond will mature in 5 years and will pay interest each June 1 and December 1. Hence the bond will pay interest of $2,500 every six months until it matures. If the current market interest rate for this type of bond is 6%, the bond's current market value will be less than $100,000. The market value of a 5% bond in a 6% bond market will be approximately $95,735. This is the present value of the $2,500 of interest that will be received every six months for 5 years plus the present value of the $100,000 that will be received at the end of 5 years. (All of the cash amounts are discounted by the market interest rate. However, the 6% annual market rate will be restated to be 3% per semiannual period and the 5 years will be restated to be 10 semiannnual periods.)
The investor's yield to maturity will be the market rate of 6% (even though the bond's stated rate is 5%) consisting of the following two components:

the current yield of more than 5.2% because the investor is receiving cash of $2,500 every six months ($5,000 per year) on an investment of only $95,735.
a gain of $4,265 because the investor bought the bond for $95,735 but will receive cash of $100,000 at maturity.",what
What is the internal rate of return?,"The internal rate of return is the interest rate that will discount an investment's future cash amounts so that the sum of the present values will be equal to cash paid at the beginning of the investment. In capital budgeting, the internal rate of return is also the interest rate that results in an investment having a net present value of zero.
To illustrate, let's assume that a company is considering an investment that will provide net cash inflows of $1,000 at the end of each year for five years. The amount of cash that the company must pay at the beginning of the investment is $3,600. Someone will need to compute the interest rate that will discount the five $1,000 future cash receipts so that their present value at the time of the investment will equal $3,600. Through software or through trial and error, you will find that the internal rate of return on this investment is approximately 12%.
The internal rate of return is one of the tools in capital budgeting that considers the time value of money and also considers all of the cash payments and cash receipts during the life of an investment.",what
What are the limitations of the payback period?,"The payback period (which tells the number of years needed to recover the amount of cash that was initially invested) has two limitations or drawbacks:

The net incremental cash flows are usually not adjusted for the time value of money. This means that a net incremental cash inflow of $50,000 in the fourth year of an investment is deemed to have the same value or purchasing power as a $50,000 cash outflow that was part of the initial investment made four years earlier.
The incremental cash flows received after the payback period are ignored. Let's illustrate what this means by using two hypothetical projects which are being considered as an investment:

Project #187 has a payback period of 4 years. However, the amounts of the net incremental cash inflows are expected to decline beginning in Year 4 and are expected to end in Year 7.
Project #188 has a payback period of 6 years. However, the amounts of its net incremental cash inflows are positive and are expected to grow exponentially from Year 4 through Year 15.

While Project #187's payback period is faster, Project #188 is a significantly better investment. Hence, the limitation of using the payback period for ranking potential investments.",what
What are net incremental cash flows?,"Net incremental cash flows are the combination of the cash inflows and the cash outflows occurring in the same time period, and between two alternatives. For example, a company could use the net incremental cash flows to decide whether to invest in new, more efficient equipment or to retain its existing equipment.
Net incremental cash flows are necessary for calculating an investment's:

net present value
internal rate of return
payback period

To illustrate net incremental cash flows let's assume that Your Corporation has the opportunity to purchase a product line from Divesting Company for a single cash payment of $800,000. Your Corporation expects that the product line will result in the following cash flows occurring in each year for 10 years:

additional cash receipts or cash inflows of $900,000 (from the collection of accounts receivable related to product sales)
additional cash payments or cash outflows of $750,000 (for payments related to the product line's costs and expenses)

These cash flows indicate that the net incremental cash flows are expected to be a positive $150,000 per year for 10 years, or that there will be net incremental cash inflows of $150,000 per year for 10 years.",what
What is ROI?,"ROI is the acronym for return on investment. Originally the objective of ROI was to relate a return (the income statement benefit) to the amount invested (such as the asset information from the balance sheet).
During the first half of the 20th century, ROI was helpful in monitoring the decentralized divisions of large diverse corporations. The ROI calculation may have divided a division's operating income by the average amount of operating assets being utilized by the division. For instance, a division with an operating income of $1 million that used $10 million of operating assets had an ROI of 10%.
A drawback of ROI is that the accounting amounts (revenues, expenses, asset book values, etc.) ignore the time value of money. As a result, companies began using discounted cash flows to better assess the profitability of its investments. Calculations such as net present value and internal rate of return became common and ROI was referred to as the accounting rate of return.
In the 21st century we see ROI used in the context of internet marketing and the adoption of wellness programs at large companies. In these examples the income statement benefits (more sales, lower health insurance expense) are related to the amounts being spent. Here, too, the ROI calculations do not consider the time value of money.",what
Are liabilities always a bad thing?,"Liabilities are obligations and are usually defined as a claim on assets. However, liabilities and stockholders' equity are also the sources of assets. Generally, liabilities are considered to have a lower cost than stockholders' equity. On the other hand, too many liabilities result in additional risk.
Some liabilities have low interest rates and some have no interest associated with them. For example, some of a company's accounts payable may allow payment in 30 days. With those payables it is better to have the liability and to keep your cash in the bank until they become due.
In our personal lives, our first house was probably purchased with a down payment and mortgage loan. That mortgage loan was a big liability, but it allowed us to upgrade our living space. I viewed my mortgage loan liability as a good thing because it allowed me to own a nice home in a beautiful neighborhood.
So some liabilities are good—especially the ones that have a very low interest rate. Too many liabilities could cause financial hardships.",what
What is a sunk cost?,"A sunk cost is a cost that was incurred in the past and cannot be undone. Since most transactions cannot be undone, most amounts spent in the past can be described as sunk. In other words, a past or sunk cost will be there regardless of what you decide to do today or in the future.
To illustrate a sunk cost, let's assume that a company spent $100,000 last year to purchase and install a machine. Today, a better machine is available for $80,000 and it will reduce expenses by $50,000 in each of the next 10 years. Now the old machine can be sold for just $10,000. When deciding whether to purchase the new machine, the $100,000 that was spent on the old machine is a sunk cost. 
Basically the decision is whether to spend an additional $70,000 today ($80,000 minus $10,000) in order to save $50,000 each year for 10 years. (Current and future income taxes will also be relevant.) It may be difficult, but we need to exclude sunk costs from our decisions.",what
Why does the internal rate of return equate to a net present value of zero?,"Internal rate of return and net present value are discounted cash flow techniques. To discount means to remove the interest contained within the future cash amounts.
If the net present value of an investment or project is more than $0, the project is earning more than the interest rate used to discount the future cash amounts. If the net present value of a project is less than $0, the project is earning less than the interest rate used to discount the future cash amounts.
If the present value of a project is exactly $0, the project is earning exactly the interest rate used to discount the future cash amounts. In other words, if a project has an internal rate of return of 15%, and you discount the project's future cash amounts by 15%, the project's net present value will be exactly $0.",what
What is a cash cow?,"A cash cow is often a profitable product or service that dominates a market and generates far more cash than is needed to maintain its market position. Companies may use the money from the cash cow to develop new products or to acquire other businesses.
The term cash cow is also used to describe a division or segment of a company that consistently generates substantial amounts of excess cash.",what
What is net present value?,"Net present value is the combination of the present value of an investment's cash inflows and the present value of the investment's cash outflows. To compute those present value amounts, the future cash flows are discounted by a specified rate. The specified rate could be the investor's cost of capital or it could be some other minimum rate that must be earned.
The advantages of using the net present value to evaluate investments are 1) all of the investment's cash flows are used in the calculation, and 2) the time value of money is considered because the future cash amounts are discounted to the present.
A project or investment that results in a net present value of $0 means that the project is expected to earn exactly the specified rate that was used in discounting the future cash flows. A slightly negative net present value indicates that the project will earn slightly less than the specified rate. For instance, if the specified rate of 16% was used for discounting the cash flows, a slightly negative net present value could mean that the project is expected to earn 15.7%. (Hence, a project could earn a very respectable profit but have a negative net present value because it just missed achieving the specified rate.)
To find the exact rate that a project is expected to earn, the project's cash flows can be used to compute the internal rate of return, which is another discounted cash flow technique for evaluating investments.",what
Why would the cost behavior change outside of the relevant range of activity?,"Cost behavior often changes outside of the relevant range of activity due to a change in the fixed costs. When volume increases to a certain point, more fixed costs will have to be added. When volume shrinks significantly, some fixed costs could be eliminated.
Here's an illustration. A company manufactures products in its 100,000 square foot plant. The company's depreciation on the plant is $1,000,000 per year. The capacity of the plant is 500,000 units of output and its normal output is 400,000 units per year. When the company is manufacturing between 300,000 and 500,000 units, it needs salaried managers earning $400,000 per year. Below 300,000 units of output, some of the salaried manager positions would be eliminated. Above 500,000 units, the company will need to add plant space and managers.
For this example, the relevant range is between 300,000 units and 500,000 units of output per year. In that range the total of the two fixed costs is $1,400,000 per year. Below 300,000 units, the fixed costs will drop to less than $1,400,000 because some salaries will be eliminated and some of the space might be rented. When the volume exceeds 500,000 units per year, the company will need to add fixed costs because of the additional space and the additional managers. Perhaps the total fixed costs will be $2,000,000 for output between 500,000 units and 700,000 units.",what
What is synergy?,"In business the term synergy is often associated with the merger or acquisition of companies.  Synergy implies that the outcomes resulting from the merger of two companies will be greater than the sum of the outcomes that would have been achieved if the organizations had not merged. Synergy is sometimes described as 1 + 1 = 3.
Let's use an example. Suppose a company operates solely in the U.S. Another company operates in Asia. The two companies decide to merge because they believe the combined company will have greater results than the total of the two companies operating independently. The synergy might come from shared research, ability to meet the needs of each other's customers, ability to attract new customers that want a single global supplier, elimination of duplicate information technology, and so on.
Synergy is not automatic since the merging organizations may experience problems caused by vastly different leadership styles and company cultures.",what
What is DCF?,"In accounting, DCF refers to discounted cash flows or to the discounted cash flow techniques such as net present value or internal rate of return.
DCF is a preferred method for evaluating capital expenditures (and other investments) because DCF recognizes the time value of money. In other words, it recognizes that receiving $10,000 of cash today is more valuable than receiving $10,000 of cash in the future. Similarly, $10,000 cash receipt in Year 10 is less valuable than a $10,000 cash receipt in Year 7.
The recognition of the time value of money occurs by discounting the related future cash flows back to the time when cash is invested. (The date that the cash is invested is often referred to as the ""present"" or the very beginning of the investment's first year.)
The greater the time value of money, the greater will be the amount of the discount. The smaller the time value of money, the smaller the amount of the discount. In turn, a larger discount will mean a smaller present value. A smaller discount will result in a greater present value.
DCF is also useful for calculating the approximate market value of bonds payable, a product line, or entire companies.",what
What is the payback reciprocal?,"The payback reciprocal is a crude estimate of the rate of return for a project or investment. The payback reciprocal is computed by dividing the digit ""1"" by a project's payback period expressed in years. For example, if a project's payback period is 4 years, the payback reciprocal is 1 divided by 4 = 0.25 = 25%.
The payback reciprocal overstates the true rate of return because it assumes that the annual cash flows will continue forever. It also assumes that the annual cash flows are identical in amount. Since these two conditions are unrealistic you should avoid the use of the payback reciprocal. Instead, you should compute the internal rate of return or the net present value because they will discount each of the actual cash amounts to reflect the time value of money.",what
What is the discounted value of expected net receipts?,"Let's first define expected net receipts. These are future receipts after deducting any related payments. For example, if you are likely to receive $1,200 one year from today, but will have to pay a fee of $200 at the time of the receipts, the expected net receipts will be $1,000.
Often we need to know the present value of amounts expected in the future. We calculate the present value by discounting the future amounts. In this situation discounting means 1) removing a specified amount of interest, or 2) adjusting for the time value of money. The concept is that receiving $1,000 in the future is less valuable than receiving $1,000 today.
If we assume that the time value of money is 10% per year, a net receipt of $1,000 one year from today will have a present value of $909. In other words, we discounted the future value of $1,000 by $91. With a time value of money of 10%, the $909 can be invested today and will grow by $91 ($909 x 10%) to be $1,000 in one year. Receiving a net amount of $1,000 in two years will have a present value of only $826. The reason is that $826 invested today at a compounded rate of 10% will grow to $1,000 in two years. If all amounts are certain, you will be in the same position whether you have $826 today or you receive $1,000 in two years.",what
What is a toxic asset?,"I would define a toxic asset as an investment whose value has dropped significantly and there is no market in which to sell the asset.
To illustrate, let's assume that at the peak of the real estate market you lent $150,000 to someone who was purchasing a house for $170,000. In other words, you made a $150,000 investment and recorded it as the asset Mortgage Loan Receivable. The house is the collateral for the loan receivable. Within one year, the local housing market drops by 30% and the borrower loses her job. She stops making the loan payments and at that point your Mortgage Loan Receivable account shows a balance of $147,000. This scenario is widespread in your community and houses are not selling.
I would consider your Mortgage Loan Receivable to be a toxic asset. There are few investors willing to purchase a loan without payments being made by the borrower, the value of the collateral has dropped to less than $120,000 ($170,000 minus the 30% average drop in value), and a lot of houses are for sale with virtually no buyers.",what
What is the rule of 72?,"The rule of 72 is a simple formula that tells you the approximate amount of time or interest rate needed for an amount to double. The formula is Years X Rate per year = 72.
Here's how it works. If you invest an amount for 8 years at 9% annual interest it will double (because 8 years X 9% = 72). If you invest an amount for 9 years at 8% it will also double (since 9 years X 8% = 72). If your investment earns 6%, it will take 12 years for it to double (since 12 years X 6% = 72; or 72 divided by 6 = 12).
If you invest $1,000 at 12% compounded annually, it will grow to approximately $2,000 in 6 years (6 X 12 = 72; or 72/12 = 6). If the $2,000 continues to earn 12% each year, six years later the investment will be worth $4,000. If the investment continues to earn 12% per year, then in six more years it will have a value of $8,000.
If successful investors were able to earn 18% each year, the value of their portfolios would have doubled every four years (72 divided by 18 = 4). If the investors live a long life and continue to earn 18% compounded annually they will become very wealthy.",what
Should a company focus on cash flows or accounting profits when making a capital expenditure decision?,"Using the incremental cash flows and discounting them to reflect the time value of money is the preferred method. The two most common techniques involved in discounting cash flows are net present value and internal rate of return.
While the discounted cash flow models are the ideal, I would also want to forecast or project the impact on the company's future financial statements. Therefore, I would also calculate and understand the effect on the accounting profits resulting from the capital expenditure.",what
Do I buy a new machine or use an old one?,"One technique for deciding whether to buy a new machine or to use an old machine is to look at the future cash flows if you buy a new machine and the future cash flows if you use the old machine. The cash flows will include the cash inflows and the cash outflows for each option. Since these cash flows will occur at different times, you must ""discount"" the future cash flows to a present value. (This is necessary in order to recognize the time value of money.) The calculation with the highest positive net present value is the option to select. Predicting all of the future cash flows can be difficult especially if the new machine will offer more features that could result in more sales, etc.
Obviously, the further into the future you look, the more uncertain are the cash flows. This problem will be offset when the future cash flows are discounted to the present. The further into the future, the bigger the discounting. This means that the present value for distant amounts will be relatively minor in amount.
Even if it is difficult to predict the near future, you could do several calculations. Each calculation would contain different assumptions. You might find that the answer will be the same under each calculation or set of assumptions.
Of course deciding to buy a new machine or to use an old one might be so obvious that the present value calculations are not necessary. For example, if your old machine is becoming unsafe, or is becoming too noisy for residents, there's little point to calculate the net present value.",what
What is cash flow net of tax?,"I view cash flow net of tax as the amount of cash spent minus the income tax savings when the amount is deductible on the corporation's income tax return.
To illustrate this, let's assume that a U.S. corporation pays a combined federal and state income tax rate of 40% on its last increment of income. If this corporation spends an additional $10,000 for a tax deductible business expense, its taxable income will decrease by $10,000. This means that the corporation will save paying $4,000 in income taxes ($10,000 less of taxable income being taxed at 40%).
In this situation, the cash flow net of tax is $6,000 consisting of the $10,000 paid for the business expense minus the $4,000 of income taxes that will not have to be paid.",what
What is the accrual basis of accounting?,"Definition of Accrual Basis of Accounting
Under the accrual basis of accounting (or accrual method of accounting), revenues are reported on the income statement when they are earned. When the revenues are earned but cash is not received, the asset accounts receivable will be recorded. (Under the cash basis of accounting, revenues are not reported on the income statement until the cash is received.)
Also under the accrual basis of accounting, expenses are reported on the income statement when they match up with the revenues being reported, or when a cost has no future benefit that can be measured. When an expense occurs and cash has not yet been paid, a liability account will also be recorded. (The expenses that were not paid in the current accounting period will be reported through adjusting entries.)
In other words, under the accrual basis of accounting, the receipt of cash and the payment of cash are not the focus of reporting revenues and expenses. Rather the focus is: 1) what revenues were earned, and 2) what expenses were incurred. Therefore, the accrual basis of accounting provides a more accurate measure of a company's profitability during an accounting period, and a more accurate picture of a company's assets and liabilities at the end of an accounting period.
Example of Reporting Revenues Under the Accrual Basis of Accounting
Let's assume that I begin an accounting business in December and during December I provided $10,000 of accounting services. Since I allow clients to pay in 30 days, none of the $10,000 of fees that I earned in December were received in December. Rather, my clients paid the $10,000 in January. Under the accrual basis of accounting my business will report the $10,000 of revenues I earned on the December income statement and will report accounts receivable of $10,000 on the December 31 balance sheet.
Example of Reporting Expenses Under the Accrual Basis of Accounting
Now let's assume that I paid office rent of $1,500 and incurred $300 of costs for electricity, gas, and sewer/water during December. However, the utilities will not read the meters until January 1, will bill me on January 10 and require that I pay the bill by February 1. Under the accrual basis of accounting I will report the rent expense in December because the rent was used up in December, and I will also report estimated utilities expense of $300 so that the December income statement provides a better measure of December's profitability. Also the December 31 balance sheet will report a liability such as utilities payable of $300 to communicate a more accurate measure of obligations at December 31.
Comparing Accrual Basis to Cash Basis
Using the transactions above, the accrual basis of accounting will result in the December income statement reporting revenues of $10,000 and expenses of $1,800 for a net income of $8,200.
Using the cash basis of accounting the December income statement will report $0 revenues and expenses of $1,500 for a net loss of $8,500 even though I had earned $10,000 in accounting fees. Further, the balance sheet will not report the obligation for the utilities that were used. The January income statement will report the collection of the fees earned in December, and the February income statement will report the expense of using the December utilities. Hence, the cash basis of accounting can be misleading to the readers of the financial statements.
For financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the accrual basis of accounting is required because of the matching principle.",what
What is the distinction between debtor and creditor?,"Definition of Debtor
A debtor is a person or enterprise that owes money to another party. The party to whom the money is owed might be a supplier, bank, or other lender who is referred to as the creditor.
Definition of Creditor
A creditor is a person, bank, or other enterprise that has lent money or extended credit to another party. The party to whom the credit has been granted is the debtor.
Examples of a Debtor and a Creditor
Assume that a company borrows money from its bank. The company is the debtor and the bank is the creditor. If a manufacturer sells merchandise to a retailer with terms of net 30 days, the manufacturer is the creditor and retailer is the debtor.",what
What is accounting?,"Definition of Accounting
Accounting is the recording of financial transactions along with storing, sorting, retrieving, summarizing, and presenting the results in various reports and analyses. Accounting is also a field of study and profession dedicated to carrying out those tasks.
Examples of Financial Accounting
One part of accounting focuses on presenting the financial information in the form of general-purpose financial statements (balance sheet, income statement, etc.) that are distributed to people outside of the company. These external reports must be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles often referred to as GAAP or US GAAP.
Examples of Management Accounting
Another part of accounting focuses on providing a company's management with the information needed to keep the business financially healthy. Although some of the information comes from recorded transactions, many of the analyses and reports include estimated and projected amounts based on various assumptions. Generally, this information is not distributed to people outside of the company's management. A few examples of this information are budgets, standards for controlling operations, and estimating selling prices when quoting prices for new work.
Other Examples of Accounting
Some of the many other examples of accounting include:

Advising on accounting systems
Income tax planning, advising, and reporting
Auditing the financial statements of companies and other organizations
Providing general business advice
Financial planning for individuals",what
What is a contingent liability?,"Definition of Contingent Liability
A contingent liability is a potential liability that may or may not become an actual liability. Whether the contingent liability becomes an actual liability depends on a future event occurring or not occurring.
In accounting, some contingent liabilities and their related contingent losses are:

Recorded with a journal entry
Are limited to a disclosure in the notes to the financial statements
Not recorded or disclosed

We have another Q&A that discusses the recording of contingent liabilities.
Examples of Contingent Liability
A company's supplier is unable to obtain a bank loan. The company agrees to guarantee that the supplier's bank loan will be repaid. As a result of the company's guarantee, the bank makes the loan to the supplier. The company has a contingent liability. If the supplier makes the loan payments needed to pay off the loan, the company will have no liability. If the supplier fails to repay the bank, the company will have an actual liability.
If a company is sued by a former employee for $500,000 for age discrimination, the company has a contingent liability. If the company is found guilty, it will have an actual liability. However, if the company is not found guilty, the company will not have any liability.
A product warranty is also a contingent liability.",what
Where do dividends appear on the financial statements?,"Definition of Dividends
Cash dividends are a distribution of a company's profits.
Financial Statements of a Corporation
The main financial statements of a corporation are:

income statement
statement of comprehensive income
balance sheet
statement of cash flows
statement of stockholders' equity

Where Dividends Appear on the Financial Statements
The dividends declared and paid by a corporation in the most recent year will be reported on these financial statements for the recent year:

statement of cash flows as a use of cash under the heading financing activities
statement of stockholders' equity as a subtraction from retained earnings

Dividends that were declared but not yet paid are reported on the balance sheet under the heading current liabilities.
Dividends on common stock are not reported on the income statement since they are not expenses. However, dividends on preferred stock will appear on the income statement as a subtraction from net income in order to report the earnings available for common stock.",what
What are accrued expenses and when are they recorded?,"Accrued Expenses
Accrued expenses are expenses that have occurred but are not yet recorded in the company's general ledger. This means these expenses will not appear on the financial statements unless an adjusting entry is entered prior to issuing the financial statements.
Example of an Accrued Expense
To illustrate an accrued expense, let's assume that a company borrowed $200,000 on December 1. The agreement requires that the company repay the $200,000 on February 28 along with $6,000 of interest for the three months of December through February. As of December 31, the company will not have an invoice to process and will not be paying the interest until it is due on February 28.
Recording an Accrued Expense
Without an adjusting entry to accrue the interest expense that was incurred by the company in December, the company's financial statements as of December 31 will not be reporting the $2,000 of interest (one-third of the $6,000) that the company has incurred in December. In order for the financial statements to be correct on the accrual basis of accounting, the accountant must record an adjusting entry dated as of December 31. The adjusting entry will consist of a debit of $2,000 to Interest Expense (an income statement account) and a credit of $2,000 to Interest Payable (a balance sheet account).

What is principles of accounting?,"Three meanings come to mind when you ask about principles of accounting...

Principles of accounting was often the title of the introductory course in accounting. It was also common for the textbook used in the course to be entitled Principles of Accounting.
Principles of accounting can also refer to the basic or fundamental principles of accounting: cost principle, matching principle, full disclosure principle, revenue recognition principle, going concern assumption, economic entity assumption, and so on. In this context, principles of accounting refers to the broad underlying concepts which guide accountants when preparing financial statements.
Principles of accounting can also mean generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In this context, principles of accounting includes both the underlying basic accounting principles and the official accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). These official pronouncements are the detailed rules or standards for specific topics.",what
What is the difference between financial accounting and management accounting?,"Definition of Financial Accounting
Financial accounting has its focus on the financial statements which are distributed to stockholders, lenders, financial analysts, and others outside of a corporation or other organization. Because of the many users, the financial statements must comply with the generally accepted accounting principles, known as GAAP or US GAAP.
Definition of Managerial Accounting
Managerial accounting is focused on assisting management in the operation of the company. This will include analyzing a company's costs, assisting in financial decisions, profit planning, calculating break-even points, capital budgeting, and calculating the costs of existing products in order to value the company's inventory and to determine the cost of goods sold (both to be used on the financial statements).",what
What is the difference between stocks and bonds?,"Definition of Stocks
Stocks, or shares of capital stock, represent an ownership interest in a corporation. Every corporation has common stock. Some corporations issue preferred stock in addition to its common stock. Shares of common stock do not have maturity dates.
Stocks pay dividends, which are a distribution of the corporation's profits to its owners. However, the dividend occurs only if the corporation's board of directors declare the dividend. The dividend payments are not an expense on the corporation's financial statements or on its U.S. income tax return.
Definition of Bonds
Bonds are a form of long-term debt in which the issuing corporation promises to pay the principal amount at a specified maturity date. 
Bonds also promise to pay a fixed interest payment to the bondholders usually every six months until the bonds mature. In the U.S. the interest paid to the bondholders by the corporation is a deductible expense on the corporation's income tax return.
Typically businesses do not issue bonds.",what
What is retained earnings?,"Definition of Retained Earnings
Retained earnings is the cumulative amount of earnings since the corporation was formed minus the cumulative amount of dividends that were declared. Retained earnings is the corporation's past earnings that have not been distributed as dividends to its stockholders.
Are Retained Earnings an Asset?
The amount of a corporation's retained earnings is reported as a separate line within the stockholders' equity section of the balance sheet. However, the past earnings that have not been distributed as dividends to the stockholders will likely be reinvested in additional income-producing assets or used to reduce the corporation's liabilities. 
Where do Retained Earnings Come From?
At the end of an accounting year, the balances in a corporation's revenue, gain, expense, and loss accounts are used to compute the year's net income. Those account balances are then transferred to the Retained Earnings account. When the year's revenues and gains exceed the expenses and losses, the corporation will have a positive net income which causes the balance in the Retained Earnings account to increase. (If the corporation's revenues and gains for the year are less than the expenses and losses, the result is a net loss that reduces the normal credit balance in the Retained Earnings account.) The balance in the Retained Earnings account is also decreased when the corporation declares a cash dividend. 
What is the Normal Balance in the Retained Earnings Account?
The normal balance in a profitable corporation's Retained Earnings account is a credit balance. This is logical since the revenue accounts have credit balances and expense accounts have debit balances. If the balance in the Retained Earnings account has a debit balance, this negative amount of retained earnings may be described as deficit or accumulated deficit.",what
What is the difference between a trial balance and a balance sheet?,"Definition of Trial Balance
A trial balance is an internal report that remains in the accounting department. The trial balance lists all of the accounts in the general ledger and their balances (or all of the accounts that have balances). However, the debit balance amounts are entered in one column and the credit balance amounts are entered in another column. Each column is then summed to prove that the total of the debit balances is equal to the total of the credit balances. (In a manual accounting system, the trial balance would draw attention to the errors occurring when transactions were journalized, posted, account balances computed, etc. With accounting software, these clerical errors are unlikely.)
Definition of Balance Sheet
A balance sheet is one of the five financial statements that are distributed outside of the accounting department and are often distributed outside of the company. The balance sheet summarizes and reports the balances from the asset, liability, and stockholders' equity accounts that are contained in the company's general ledger. The balance sheet is also referred to as the statement of financial position.",what
What is the purpose of the cash flow statement?,"Purpose of the Cash Flow Statement
The purpose of the cash flow statement or statement of cash flows or SCF is to identify the major cash flows occurring during the same period of time as the company's income statement and between the related balance sheets.
The major cash flows are presented in one of these classifications:

Operating activities
Investing activities
Financing activities

The net change from these three classifications also explains the major reasons for the change in the company's cash and cash equivalents between two balance sheet dates.
In addition to the cash amounts being reported as operating, investing, and financing activities, the cash flow statement is required to disclose other information, including the amount of interest paid, the amount of income taxes paid, and any significant investing and financing activities which did not require the use of cash.",what
What are net assets?,"Definition of Net Assets
Net assets is defined as total assets  minus total liabilities.
Examples of Net Assets
In a sole proprietorship the amount of net assets is reported as owner's equity.
In a corporation the amount of net assets is reported as stockholders' equity.
In a not-for-profit (NFP) organization, the net amount of its total assets minus total liabilities is actually reported as net assets in its statement of financial position.
The net assets section for the NFP organization is divided into two major classifications:

net assets without donor restrictions
net assets with donor restrictions",what
What is the statement of financial position?,"Definition of Statement of Financial Position
The statement of financial position is another name for the balance sheet. It is one of the main financial statements.
The statement of financial position reports an entity's assets, liabilities, and the difference in their totals as of the final moment of an accounting period.
The structure of the statement of financial position is similar to the basic accounting equation. For a corporation the format will be: Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders' Equity. A nonprofit organization's format will be: Assets = Liabilities + Net Assets.
The statement of financial position must reflect the basic accounting principles and guidelines such as the cost, matching, and full disclosure principle to name a few. Accordingly, the statement of financial position is more meaningful when it is prepared under the accrual method of accounting.",what
What is GAAP?,"Definition of GAAP
GAAP is the acronym for generally accepted accounting principles. GAAP consists of the following:

Basic underlying accounting principles, assumptions, and concepts such as the cost principle, matching principle, full disclosure principle, and more.
Detailed reporting standards and other rules established and organized by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in its Accounting Standards Codification (FASB ASC)
Generally accepted industry practices

Examples of the Basic Underlying Accounting Principles
The basic underlying accounting principles are:

Economic Entity Assumption
Going Concern Assumption
Time Period Assumption
Monetary Unit Assumption
Cost Principle (or Measurement Principle)
Matching Principle (or Expense Recognition Principle)
Revenue Recognition Principle
Full Disclosure Principle
Industry Practices

In addition to the basic underlying accounting principles, there are various characteristics that also guide accountants. Some of the characteristics include objectivity, conservatism, materiality, cost/benefit, comparability, relevance, and timeliness.
Why GAAP is Important
In order for investors, bankers, financial analysts, portfolio managers, etc. to make informed decisions, it is necessary to have financial statements that are consistent and which can be compared to the financial statements of other corporations. This is more likely to occur when there are common rules for financial reporting. When financial statements are distributed by a business or other organization, the common rules that must be followed are known as generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP.",what
What is a balance sheet and why is it prepared?,"Definition of Balance Sheet
The balance sheet is prepared in order to report an organization's financial position at the end of an accounting period, such as midnight on December 31.
A corporation's balance sheet reports its:

Assets (resources that were acquired in past transactions)
Liabilities (obligations and customer deposits)
Stockholders' equity (the difference between the amount of assets and liabilities)

You can view the balance sheet as reporting the assets and the claims against those assets (liabilities and stockholders' equity). You can also view the balance sheet as reporting a corporation's assets and the amounts that were provided by creditors (the liabilities) and the amounts provided by the owners (the stockholders' equity).
A classified balance sheet reports the current assets in a section that is separate from the long-term assets. Similarly, current liabilities are reported in a section that is separate from long-term liabilities. This allows bankers, owners, and others to easily compute the amount of an organization's working capital and current ratio.
The balance sheet has some limitations. For example, the property, plant and equipment are reported at cost minus the accumulated depreciation (except land). If these assets have increased in value, the fair value is not reported because of the cost principle. Also, brand names and trademarks may have significant value, but cannot be reported on the balance sheet unless they were acquired in a business transaction.
The balance sheet should be read with the other financial statements (income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of cash flows, and the statement of changes in stockholders' equity) including the notes to the financial statements.",what
How are the balance sheet and income statement connected?,"Connection between Balance Sheet and Income Statement
The connection between the balance sheet and the income statement results from:

The use of double-entry accounting or bookkeeping, and
 The accounting equation Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity

Basically, the income statement components have the following effects on owner's equity:

Revenues and gains cause owner's (or stockholders') equity to increase
Expenses and losses cause owner's (or stockholders') equity to decrease

Example of How the Balance Sheet and Income Statement Are Connected
To illustrate the connection between the balance sheet and income statement, let's assume that a company's owner's equity was $40,000 at the beginning of the year, and it was $65,000 at the end of the year. Let's also assume that the owner did not invest or withdraw business assets during the year. Therefore, the $25,000 increase in owner's equity is likely the company's net income earned for the year. The details for the $25,000 (revenues, expenses, gains, losses) will be reported on the company's income statement for the year.
Accountants refer to the income statement accounts (revenues, expenses, gains, losses) as temporary accounts because their balances will be closed and transferred to the owner's capital account at the end of the year.",what
Is income tax an expense or liability?,"Definition of Income Tax
In the accounting for a regular U.S. corporation, income tax usually refers to the federal, state, local, and foreign countries' taxes that are levied based on a corporation's taxable income. The taxable income and the related income tax are found on the corporation's income tax return. (The corporation's taxable income is based on the income tax laws and regulations of the various governments.)
The accounting and financial reporting of a regular corporation's income taxes is complicated because the accounting principles are likely to be different from the income tax laws and regulations. Generally, a profitable regular corporation's financial statements will report both income tax expense and a current liability such as income taxes payable.
Examples of Income Tax Expense and Income Taxes Payable
A profitable corporation's financial statements will report:

Income tax expense on its income statement for the revenues and expenses appearing on the accounting period's income statement, and
Income taxes payable (a current liability on the balance sheet) for the amount of income taxes owed to the various governments as of the date of the balance sheet

If a corporation has overpaid its income taxes and is entitled to a refund, the amount will be reported on the balance sheet as a current asset such as Other receivables.
If there are differences between the time when certain revenues and expenses are reported on the income tax returns versus when they are reported on the financial statements, the amount of the deferred income tax will likely be reported on the balance sheet as a noncurrent liability as Deferred income taxes.",what
What is the accounts receivable turnover ratio?,"Definition of Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio
The accounts receivable turnover ratio is an important financial ratio that indicates a company's ability to collect its accounts receivable. Collecting accounts receivable is critical for a company to pay its obligations when they are due.
The calculation of the accounts receivable turnover ratio is: credit sales for a year divided by the company's average amount of accounts receivable throughout that year. Note that only the company's credit sales (or sales on credit) are used in the calculation, since cash sales do not involve accounts receivable.
Example of Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio
To illustrate the calculation of the accounts receivable turnover, let's assume that a company’s credit sales for the most recent year were $6,000,000 and its average amount of accounts receivable during that year were $600,000. As a result, the accounts receivable turnover ratio is: credit sales of $6,000,000 divided by the average amount of accounts receivable of $600,000 = 10 times a year. This indicates that on average the company’s accounts receivables turned over 10 times during the year, or approximately every 36 days (360 or 365 days per year divided by the turnover of 10).
Whether the accounts receivable turnover ratio of 10 is good or bad depends on the company's past ratios, the average for other companies in the same industry, and the specific credit terms given to the company's customers.
Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio is an Average
It is important to emphasize that the accounts receivable turnover ratio is an average, since an average can hide important details. For example, some past due receivables could be ""hidden"" or offset by receivables that have paid faster than the average. If you have access to the company's details, you should review a detailed aging of accounts receivable to detect slow paying customers.",what
What is the meaning of debtor?,"Definition of Debtor
A debtor is a person, company, or other entity that owes money. In other words, the debtor has a debt or legal obligation to pay the amount owed. 
Example of Debtor
If a company borrows $10,000 from a bank, the company is the debtor and the bank is the creditor.",what
"What is the difference between revenue, income, and gain?","Definition of Revenue
Revenue is the amount earned from a company's main operating activities, such as a retailer selling merchandise or a law firm providing legal services.
Definition of Gain
In accounting, a gain is the result of a peripheral activity, such as a retailer selling one of its old delivery trucks. A gain occurs when the cash amount (or its equivalent) received is greater than the asset's carrying amount, which is also referred to as the asset's book value. For example, if the company receives $3,000 for the old delivery truck, and the truck's carry amount (book value) at the time of the sale was $600, the company will have a gain of $2,400.
Definition of Income
Non-accountants might use the term income instead of the word revenue. Generally, accountants use the term income to mean ""net of revenues and expenses."" For example, a retailer's income from operations is its net sales minus the cost of goods sold minus its selling, general and administrative expenses.",what
What is the difference between a cost and an expense?,"Definitions of Cost and Expense
Some people use cost interchangeably with expense. However, we use the term cost to mean the amount spent to purchase an item, a service, etc. Some costs are not expenses (cost of land), some costs will become expenses (cost of a new delivery van), and some costs become expenses immediately (airing a televison advertisement). 
Examples of Costs and Expenses
Assume that a company purchases 2,000 units of a supply item each of which has a cost of $5. If none of the units have been used, the current asset supplies will be reported at the cost of $10,000 (2,000 units at $5 each). At the time of the next balance sheet, only 500 of the units are on hand and 1,500 units have been used in the business. As a result, the balance sheet will report the supplies on hand at their cost of $2,500 (500 units at $5) and the income statement will report supplies expense of $7,500 (1,500 units at $5). 
Assume that a company purchases a delivery truck to be used in its business. Initially the truck's cost will be recorded in the asset account Delivery Truck. However, the truck's cost will become Depreciation Expense as the truck is ""used up"" in the company's revenue-generating activities.",what
"What is reported as property, plant and equipment?","Definition of Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment is the long-term asset or noncurrent asset section of the balance sheet that reports the tangible, long-lived assets that are used in the company's operations. These assets are commonly referred to as the company's fixed assets or plant assets.
Generally, the property, plant and equipment assets are reported at their cost followed by a deduction for the accumulated depreciation that applies to all of these assets except land (which is not depreciated).
Examples of Property, Plant and Equipment
Typical assets that are included in property, plant and equipment are land, buildings, machinery, equipment, vehicles, furniture, fixtures, office equipment, etc. which are used in the business. Also included in this balance sheet classification is a subtraction of the accumulated depreciation that pertains to these assets.",what
What is the current ratio?,"Definition of Current Ratio
The current ratio is a financial ratio that shows the proportion of a company's current assets to its current liabilities. The current ratio is often classified as a liquidity ratio and a larger current ratio is better than a smaller one. However, a company's liquidity is dependent on converting the current assets to cash in time to pay its obligations. 
Example of Current Ratio
If a company's current assets are $600,000 and its current liabilities are $200,000 the current ratio is 3:1. If the current assets are $600,000 and the current liabilities are $500,000 the current ratio is 1.2:1. Obviously a larger current ratio is better than a smaller ratio. Some people feel that a current ratio that is less than 1:1 indicates insolvency. However, some online sellers with customers paying with credit cards at the time of ordering may operate comfortably with a very low current ratio. 
It is wise to compare a company's current ratio to that of other companies in the same industry. You are also wise to compare a company's recent current ratio to its ratio at earlier dates. In other words, spotting a trend can be important.
Caution
The composition of the current assets is also an important consideration. If the current assets are predominantly in cash, marketable securities, and collectible accounts receivable, that is likely to provide more liquidity than a huge amount of slow moving inventory.",what
What is an impairment?,"Definition of Impairment
The term impairment is associated with an asset currently having a market value that is less than the asset's book value . A test is done to determine whether the asset's book value should be reduced to the current market value and to report the amount of the write-down (reduction) as a loss on its income statement.
Examples of Impairment
A meat packing plant in recent years invested large amounts in its plant and equipment. Since then, the company experienced a dramatic decline in the demand for its products and in the value of its plant and equipment. If the required test of impairment indicates that a loss must be recorded on its plant and equipment, its book value must be reduced and the resulting loss reported on its income statement.
A second example is Corporation X that acquired another company. The amount paid for the company resulted in Corporation X reporting a large amount for the intangible asset goodwill. Since the acquisition, the acquired company's value has declined to only a small fraction of the amount currently reported as goodwill. A test must be done and it may require a reduction in the reported amount of goodwill and a resulting impairment loss reported on the company's income statement.",what
What is the difference between accounts payable and accrued expenses payable?,"Definition of Accounts Payable
Accounts Payable is a liability account in which suppliers' or vendors' approved invoices are recorded. As a result, the balance in Accounts Payable should be a precise amount.
Definition of Accrued Expenses Payable
Accrued Expenses Payable is a liability account that records amounts that are owed, but the vendors' invoices have not yet been received and/or have not yet been recorded in Accounts Payable as of the end of the accounting period. The amounts in this account are usually recorded with accrual adjusting entries made at the end of the accounting period.
Examples of Accrued Expenses Payable
In addition to the amounts associated with vendors' invoices, accrued expenses may also include wages, interest, utilities, and other expenses that were incurred and owed, but not yet recorded in the general ledger accounts. Some of the amounts recorded in Accrued Expenses Payable may be estimated amounts that should supported by reasonable and documented calculations.

What is financial reporting?,"Definition of Financial Reporting
Financial reporting includes all of a company's communication of financial information to people outside of the company. 
Examples of Financial Reporting
Financial reporting includes the following:

External financial statements (income statement, statement of comprehensive income, balance sheet, statement of cash flows, and statement of stockholders' equity)
The notes to the financial statements
Press releases and conference calls regarding quarterly earnings and related information
Quarterly and annual reports to stockholders
Financial information posted on a corporation's website
Financial reports to governmental agencies including quarterly and annual reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
Prospectuses pertaining to the issuance of common stock and other securities",what
What is materiality?,"Definition of Materiality
In accounting, materiality refers to the relative size of an amount. Relatively large amounts are material, while relatively small amounts are not material (or immaterial). Determining materiality requires professional judgement. For instance, a $20,000 amount will likely be immaterial for a large corporation with a net income of $900,000. However, the same $20,000 amount will be material for a small corporation with a net income of $40,000.
Another view of materiality is whether sophisticated investors would be misled if the amount was omitted or misclassified. If sophisticated investors would be misled or would have made a different decision, the amount is considered to be material. If sophisticated investors would not be misled or would not have made a different decision, the amount is judged to be immaterial. 
Example of Materiality
A classic example of the materiality concept is a company expensing a $20 wastebasket in the year it is acquired instead of depreciating it over its useful life of 10 years. The matching principle directs you to record the wastebasket as an asset and then report depreciation expense of $2 a year for 10 years. Materiality allows you to expense the entire $20 cost in the year it is acquired. The reason is that no investor, creditor, or other interested party would be misled by immediately expensing the $20 wastebasket.
Materiality also justifies large corporations having a policy of immediately expensing assets having a cost of less than $2,500 instead of setting up fixed asset records and depreciating those assets over their useful lives.",what
What is cash from operating activities?,"Definition of Cash from Operating Activities
Cash from operating activities usually refers to the first section of the statement of cash flows. Cash from operating activities focuses on the cash inflows and outflows from a company's main business activities of buying and selling merchandise, providing services, etc.
Basically, the cash from operating activities includes the company's cash flows except for those reported as cash flows from 1) investing activities (buying and selling property, plant and equipment, buying and selling long-term investments), and 2) financing activities (borrowing and repaying short-term and long-term debt, issuing and buying back shares of stock, paying dividends).
Examples of Reporting the Cash from Operating Activities
In the U.S., the cash from operating activities can be presented using either of the following methods:

Indirect method (almost always used)
Direct method (rarely used)

The indirect method begins with the company's net income based on the accrual method. That amount is then converted to the cash from operating activities by adding back depreciation expense and adjusting for the changes in accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, and most other current assets and current liabilities.
The direct method for reporting the cash from operating activities lists the following: the amounts collected from customers, the payments to suppliers, the payments for operating expenses, payments for interest expense, and payments for income taxes.",what
What is the full disclosure principle?,"Definition of Full Disclosure Principle
The full disclosure principle requires a company to provide the necessary information so that people who are accustomed to reading financial information are able to make informed decisions regarding the company.
Examples of Full Disclosure Principle
The disclosures required under this principle can be found in a number of places, such as:

The company's financial statements including the notes to the financial statements and supplementary schedules
A publicly-traded corporation's annual report to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (Form 10-K), especially the section entitled Management's Discussion and Analysis
Quarterly earnings reports, press releases and other communications

The notes to a company's financial statements will likely begin with a description of the company's significant accounting policies such as how and when revenues are recognized, how property is depreciated, how inventory and income taxes are accounted for, and more.
Other disclosures in the notes to the financial statements include the effects of new accounting pronouncements, details regarding earnings per share, receivables, advertising, leases, related-party transactions, income taxes, stock options, contingent liabilities, and much more.",what
What is a liquidity ratio?,"Definition of Liquidity Ratio
A liquidity ratio is a financial ratio that indicates whether a company's current assets will be sufficient to meet the company's obligations when they become due.
Examples of Liquidity Ratios
Typically, the following financial ratios are considered to be liquidity ratios:

Current ratio
Quick ratio or acid test ratio

The amount of a company's working capital is also cited as an indicator of liquidity.
However, a company with a large amount of inventory that is difficult to sell may have a large amount of working capital and a favorable current ratio, but may not have liquidity. Hence, the inventory turnover ratio and the accounts receivable turnover ratio can provide insights as to a company's ability to convert its current assets to cash in time to pay its obligations when they become due.",what
What is interest expense?,"Definition of Interest Expense
Interest expense is the cost of borrowing money during a specified period of time. Interest expense is occurring daily, but the interest is likely to be paid monthly, quarterly, semiannually, or annually.
Example of Interest Expense
Let's assume that a company uses the accrual basis of accounting. If the company borrows $100,000 on December 15 and agrees to pay interest on the 15th day of each month at the rate of 1% per month, the interest expense for the month of December will be approximately $500 ($100,000 x 1% x 1/2 month). The interest expense for the month of January will be $1,000 ($100,000 x 1%).
In this example, as of December 31 no interest has been paid on the loan that began on December 15. However, the company did incur one-half month of interest expense. Therefore, the company needs to record an accrual adjusting entry that debits Interest Expense for $500, and credits Interest Payable for $500.",what
Where is a contingent liability recorded?,"Recording a Contingent Liability
A potential or contingent liability that is both probable and the amount can be estimated is recorded as 1) an expense or loss on the income statement, and 2) a liability on the balance sheet. 
Disclosing a Contingent Liability
A loss contingency which is possible but not probable will not be recorded in the accounts as a liability and a loss. Rather, it will be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
A loss contingency that is probable or possible but the amount cannot be estimated means the amount cannot be recorded in the company's accounts or reported as liability on the balance sheet. Instead, the contingent liability will be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. 
Not Reporting or Disclosing a Contingent Liability
A loss contingency that is remote  will not be recorded and it will not have to be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. An example is a nuisance lawsuit where there is no similar case that was ever successful.
Example of Recording a Contingent Liability
Product warranties are often cited as a contingent liability that meets both of the required conditions (probable and the amount can be estimated). Product warranties will be recorded at the time of the products' sales by debiting Warranty Expense and crediting to Warranty Liability for the estimated amount.",what
What is the operating cycle?,"Operating cycle definition
The operating cycle is the time required for a company's cash to be put into its operations and then return to the company's cash account.
Operating cycle example
A manufacturer's operating cycle is amount of time required for the manufacturer's cash to be used to:

pay for the raw materials needed in its products
pay for the labor and overhead costs needed to convert the raw materials into products
hold the finished products in inventory until they are sold
wait for the customers' cash payments to be collected

The operating cycle is the sum of the following:

the days' sales in inventory (365 days/inventory turnover ratio), plus
the average collection period (365 days/accounts receivable turnover ratio)

The operating cycle has importance in classifying current assets and current liabilities. While most manufacturers have operating cycles of several months, a few industries require very long processing times. This could result in an operating cycle that is longer than one year. To accommodate those industries, the accountants' definitions of current assets and current liabilities include the following phrase: ...within one year or within the operating cycle, whichever is longer.

Where does the purchase of equipment show up on a profit and loss statement?,"Reporting the Purchase of Equipment
Assuming that the purchase of equipment is a long-term or noncurrent asset that will be used in a business, the purchase will not  be reported on the profit and loss statement (income statement, statement of earnings). Rather, the equipment's cost will be reported in the general ledger account Equipment, which is reported on the balance sheet under the classification Property, plant and equipment. The purchase will also be included in the company's capital expenditures that are reported on the statement of cash flows in the section entitled cash flows from investing activities.
When the equipment is placed into service, the company will begin to report depreciation expense on the profit and loss statements during the years that the equipment is used.
Example of Equipment's Cost on Income Statement
Let's assume that a company buys equipment for $100,000 and it is expected to be used for 10 years with no salvage value at the end of its useful life. Using the straight-line method of depreciation, each year's profit and loss statement will report depreciation expense of $10,000 for 10 years. Each year the account Accumulated Depreciation will be credited for the $10,000 of annual depreciation.",what
Would you please explain unearned income?,"Definition of Unearned Income
Unearned income or deferred income is a receipt of money before it has been earned. This is also referred to as deferred revenues or customer deposits. The unearned amount is initially recorded in a liability account such as Deferred Income, Deferred Revenues, or Customer Deposits. As the amount is earned, the liability account is reduced and the amount earned will be reported on the income statement as revenues.
Example #1 of Unearned Income
A lawn service company offers customers a special package of five applications of fertilizers and weed treatments for $300. However, the customer must prepay in December for the five treatments that will be done between April and September. When the company receives the $300 in December, it will debit the asset Cash for $300 and will credit the liability account Unearned Revenues. Since these are balance sheet accounts (and since no work has yet been performed), there are no revenues to be reported in December. In April when the first service is provided, the company will debit the liability account Unearned Revenues for $60 and will credit the income statement account Service Revenues for $60. At the end of April, the balance sheet will report the company's remaining liability of $240. The income statement for April will report the $60 that was earned. The $60 entry is referred to as an adjusting entry and the same entry will be recorded when each of the remaining four treatments are provided.
Example #2 of Unearned Income
A company informs a new customer that a $5,000 deposit is required before it will begin work on the customer's special order. The customer gives the company $5,000 on December 28 and the company will begin work on the special order on January 3. On December 28 the company will debit Cash for $5,000 and will credit a liability account, such as Customer Deposits (or Unearned Revenues or Deferred Revenues) for $5,000. No revenue is reported in December for this special order since the company did not perform any work in December. When the special order begins and is completed in January, the company will debit the liability account for $5,000 and will credit a revenue account.",what
What is the income statement?,"Definition of Income Statement
The income statement is also known as the statement of operations, profit and loss statement, and statement of earnings. It is one of a company's main financial statements. The purpose of the income statement is to report a summary of a company's revenues, expenses, gains, losses, and the resulting net income that occurred during a year, quarter, or other period of time.
Examples of Items Appearing in the Income Statement
The main items reported in the income statement are:

Revenues, which are the amounts earned through the sale of goods and/or the providing of services
Expenses, which include the cost of goods sold, SG&A expenses, and interest expense
Gains and losses, such as the sale of a noncurrent asset for an amount that is different from its book value
Net income, which is the result of subtracting the company's expenses and losses from the company's revenues and gains. Corporations with shares of common stock that are publicly traded often refer to net income as earnings and their income statements must include the earnings per share of common stock

How the Income Statement Amounts are Calculated
The income statement amounts are best calculated for a specific period of time by using the accrual basis of accounting. Under the accrual basis the revenues are the amounts that were earned (not the amount of cash received), and the expenses are the amounts that best match the revenues or were used up during the period (not the cash that was paid out).",what
What are the effects of depreciation?,"Definition of Depreciation
Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the cost of a company's assets used in its business from the balance sheet to the income statement (as an expense) over their estimated useful lives.
Depreciation occurs through an accounting adjusting entry in which the account Depreciation Expense is debited and the contra asset account Accumulated Depreciation is credited.
Effects of Depreciation
The following are some of the effects for a corporation that is depreciating assets:

The net income, retained earnings, and stockholders' equity are reduced with the debit to Depreciation Expense
The carrying value of the assets being depreciated and amount of total assets are reduced by the credit to Accumulated Depreciation
The depreciation expense reported on the U.S. income tax return (based on the tax regulations) reduces a corporation's taxable income (and its related income tax payments).",what
What are accounting principles?,"Definition of Accounting Principles
Accounting principles are the common rules that must be followed when preparing financial statements that are distributed to people outside of the company (or other organization).
Examples of Accounting Principles
The basic underlying accounting principles, guidelines and assumptions include the following:

the cost principle
matching principle
full disclosure principle
revenue recognition principle
industry-specific regulatory rules
materiality, conservatism, consistency, and others

In the U.S. the accounting principles also include the many complex, detailed rules that are established and maintained by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).
The combination of the basic underlying guidelines and the complex detailed accounting rules are referred to as generally accepted accounting principles (or US GAAP or GAAP).",what
What is historical cost?,"Definition of Historical Cost
Historical cost is a term used instead of the term cost. Cost and historical cost usually mean the original cost at the time of a transaction.
The term historical cost distinguishes an asset's cost from its replacement cost, current cost, or inflation-adjusted cost. 
Generally, the cost principle or historical cost principle requires that an asset should be reported at its cash or cash equivalent amount at the time of the transaction and should include all costs necessary to get the asset in place and ready for use.
Example of Historical Cost
Let's assume that a company purchased land in 1997 for $100,000. It continues to own the land and has not made any improvements. Today the land should be reported on the company's balance sheet at its historical cost of $100,000 even though its current cost, replacement cost, inflation-adjusted cost, appraised value, and assessed value amounts range from $150,000 to $270,000.",what
What is window dressing?,"Definition of Window Dressing
Window dressing refers to actions taken or not taken prior to issuing financial statements in order to improve the appearance of the financial statements.
Example of Window Dressing
Let's assume that a company operates throughout the year with a negative balance in its general ledger account Cash: Checking Account. (At the bank, the checking account has a positive balance due to the time it takes for the company's checks to clear.) In order to avoid its December 31 balance sheet reporting a negative cash balance, the company decides to postpone issuing checks for vendors' invoices that should have been paid. The postponement allows its general ledger Cash account to temporarily have a positive amount. On January 2, the company will issue the postponed checks and will resume its normal practice of having a negative balance in its Cash account.",what
What is a fiscal year?,"Definition of Fiscal Year
A fiscal year is an accounting year that does not end on December 31. (Accounting years of January 1 through December 31 are known as calendar years.)
A fiscal year could be a 12-month period of time or a 52/53-week period of time.
One reason a U.S. business or other organization will have its accounting year end on a date other than December 31 is to coincide with its natural business year.
When an organization's fiscal year ends outside of the CPAs' busy season, the organization may be able to negotiate a lower auditing fee.
Examples of Fiscal Years
A few examples of fiscal years include:

12 months of February 1 through January 31
12 months of October 1 through September 30
12 months of June 1 through May 31
52 weeks ending on the Saturday closest to January 31. (Since 52 weeks X 7 days = 364 days vs. 365 days per year, there will be an occasional 53-week year)

School districts typically have fiscal years of July 1 through June 30 to coincide with its natural business year. Large retailers often end their fiscal years on the Saturday closest to January 31 in order to include sales returns from its peak December sales. The retailers' interim periods will be 13-week ""quarters"" consisting of one 5-week ""month"" plus two 4-week ""months"". This allows for better comparisons between years.",what
What is the difference between net cash flow and net income?,"Under the accrual method of accounting, net income is calculated as follows: revenues earned minus the expenses incurred in order to earn those revenues. If a company earns revenues in December but allows those customers to pay in 30 days, the cash from the December revenues will likely be received in January. In this situation the December revenues will increase the December net income, but will not increase the company's December net cash flow.
Under accrual accounting, expenses are matched to the accounting period when the related revenues occur or when the costs have expired. For example, a retailer may have purchased and paid for merchandise in October. However, the merchandise remained in inventory until it was sold in December. The company's net cash flow decreases in October when the company pays for the merchandise. However, net income decreases in December when the cost of the goods sold is matched with the December sales.
There are many other examples of expenses occurring in one accounting period but the payments occur in a different accounting period. In short, the statement of cash flows is a needed financial statement because the income statement does not report cash flows.",what
What is the difference between paid-in capital and retained earnings?,"Definition of Paid-in Capital
Paid-in capital is one of the major categories of stockholders' equity. Generally, paid-in capital reports the amount that a corporation received from its stockholders (or shareholders) in exchange for the newly issued shares of its capital stock. 
Paid-in capital is also referred to as contributed capital and as permanent capital.
Definition of Retained Earnings
Generally, retained earnings is the cumulative amount of after-tax net income earned by the corporation since its inception minus the dividends that have been distributed to its stockholders since the corporation began.",what
Is the installation labor for a new asset expensed or included in the cost of the asset?,"Accounting for Labor to Install Asset
The definition of an asset's cost is all costs that are necessary to get an asset in place and ready for use. Therefore, the cost of the installation labor (wages and related fringe benefits) is part of the cost of the asset (and not an immediate expense of the accounting period).
The total cost of the asset, including installation costs, will become an expense when the asset depreciated over the asset's useful life.",what
What is a financial statement?,"Definition of Financial Statement
Generally, the term financial statement could be referring to:

General-purpose, external financial reports that are distributed by a company to people outside of the company
A more-detailed, internal financial report that remains inside of the company for use by the company's management

The external financial statements of a U.S. corporation must be prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (referred to as US GAAP).
Examples of Financial Statements
The external financial statements issued by U.S. corporations should include all of the following:

Income statement
Statement of comprehensive income
Balance sheet or statement of financial position
Statement of cash flows
Statement of stockholders' equity",what
How does revenue affect the balance sheet?,"Effect of Revenue on the Balance Sheet
Generally, when a corporation earns revenue there is an increase in current assets (cash or accounts receivable) and an increase in the retained earnings component of stockholders' equity .
When a company earns revenue that had been prepaid by a customer, the company's balance sheet's liability deferred revenue will decrease and retained earnings will increase. 
Examples of the Effect of Revenue on the Balance Sheet
Examples of revenue include the sales of merchandise, service fee revenue, subscription revenue, advertising revenue, interest revenue, etc. The revenue accounts are temporary accounts that facilitate the preparation of the income statement. However, when a corporation earns revenue, it has the effect of increasing Retained Earnings. We can see this with the end-of-the-year closing entries which will move all the income statement account balances to Retained Earnings.
Let's assume that today a corporation sold goods on credit. The corporation's current asset Accounts Receivable will increase and the company will credit the income statement account Sales. However, the Sales account is a temporary account that has the effect of increasing the corporation's retained earnings.
Let's assume that on December 31 a corporation received $10,000 for services to be done in January. Therefore, the corporation's cash that is reported on the December 31 balance sheet includes the $10,000 and the balance sheet will also report a current liability deferred revenues of $10,000. In January, when the services have been provided, the corporation will record Service Fee Revenue of $10,000 (which has the effect of increasing the corporation's retained earnings) and will eliminate the current liability of $10,000 that appeared on the December 31 balance sheet.",what
What is an accounting period?,"Definition of Accounting Period
An accounting period is the period of time covered by a company's financial statements. Common accounting periods for external financial statements include the calendar year (January 1 through December 31) and the calendar quarter (January 1 through March 31, April 1 through June 30, July 1 through September 30, October 1 through December 31). It is common for these companies to also have monthly accounting periods. However, the financial statements for the monthly accounting periods are likely to be used only by the companies' managements.
In the U.S., some companies have annual accounting periods that end on dates other than December 31. For example, a company could have a fiscal year of July 1 through the following June 30. Its quarterly accounting periods would be July 1 through September 30, etc.
It is also common for U.S. retailers to have accounting periods that end on a Saturday. The annual accounting period for these businesses may be the 52- or 53-week fiscal years ending on the Saturday closest to February 1 or any other date. The retailers' quarterly accounting periods will be the 13-week periods, and the monthly accounting periods will be a 4- or 5-week time period. 
Examples of Accounting Periods
The following are some examples of accounting periods used by U.S. companies:

Annual calendar year of January 1 through December 31
Annual fiscal year such as July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020; April 1, 2019 through March 31, 2020; etc.
52- or 53-week fiscal year such as the 52 or 53 weeks ending on the last Saturday of January, etc.
Calendar quarters such as January 1 through March 31, April 1 through June 30, etc.

Fiscal quarters such as May 1 through July 31, August 1 through October 31, etc.
13-week fiscal quarters such as the 13 weeks ending on the last Saturday in April, etc.
Calendar months such as March 1 through March 31, November 1 through November 30, etc.
4- or 5-week fiscal months such as the 4 weeks ending the last Saturday of February, etc.",what
What are accrued revenues and when are they recorded?,"Accrued revenues are fees and interest that have been earned and sales that occurred, but they have not yet been recorded through the normal invoicing paperwork. Since these are not yet in the accountant's general ledger, they will not appear on the financial statements unless an adjusting entry is entered prior to preparing the financial statements.
Here's an example. Your company lent a supplier $100,000 on December 1. The agreement is for the $100,000 to be repaid on February 28 along with $3,000 of interest for the three months of December through February. As of December 31 your company will not have a transaction/invoice/receipt for the interest it is earning since all of the interest is due on February 28. Without an adjusting entry to accrue the revenue it earned in December, your company's financial statements as of December 31 will not be reporting the $1,000 (one-third of the $3,000 of interest) that it has earned in December. In order for the financial statements to be correct on the accrual basis of accounting, the accountant needs to record an adjusting entry dated as of December 31. The adjusting entry will consist of a debit of $1,000 to Interest Receivable (a balance sheet account) and a credit of $1,000 to Interest Income or Interest Revenue (income statement accounts).",what
How do you amortize goodwill?,"Prior to 2001, the U.S. accounting rules required goodwill to be amortized to expense over a period not to exceed 40 years. However, in June 2001 the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued its Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. This accounting pronouncement ended the automatic amortization of goodwill to expense for U.S. financial reporting.
While goodwill is no longer amortized to expense in uniform increments, goodwill is to be measured annually to determine if there is an impairment loss. (However beginning in 2015, private companies may opt to amortize goodwill generally over a 10-year period and thereby minimize the cost and complexity involved with testing for impairment.)",what
What is a classified balance sheet?,"A classified balance sheet is one that arranges the balance sheet accounts into a format that is useful for the readers. For example, most balance sheets use the following asset classifications:

current
long-term investments
property, plant and equipment
intangible assets
other assets

Liabilities are usually classified as:

current, or
noncurrent or long-term liabilities",what
What is Big 4 Accounting?,"Big 4 usually refers to the four largest accounting and auditing firms: PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, Ernst & Young, and KPMG. These certified public accounting (CPA) firms perform most of the audits which are required of U.S. corporations having stock that is publicly traded.
In the 1980s and before, the majority of the audits of publicly traded corporations were performed by the Big 8—the eight largest CPA firms. However, some of those firms merged with others and Arthur Andersen ceased to exist. As a result, the Big 8 is now the Big 4.
The reference to Big 4 exists because the size of each of the four largest firms is several times the size of the 5th largest firm. There was a similar size disparity in the 1980s between the 8th largest firm and the 9th largest firm.
In addition to performing audits and other assurance services, the Big 4 provide tax advising and various management services.",what
What are consolidated financial statements?,"Consolidated financial statements combine the financial statements of separate legal entities controlled by a parent company into one set of financial statements for the entire group of companies.
For example, let's assume that Northern Electric Power (NEP) is an electric utility with its stock traded on a stock exchange. NEP acquires all of the stock of Midwest Gas Corporation (MGC). Both NEP and MGC continue as separate legal entities. NEP is the parent company and MGC is the subsidiary company. Each of these corporations will continue to operate its respective business and each will issue its own financial statements. However, the investors and potential investors in NEP will find it helpful to see the financial results and the financial position of the economic entity (the combination of NEP and MGC) that they control.
The consolidated income statement of NEP will report all of the revenues that the economic entity earned from outside customers. (Since the sales of electricity from NEP to MGC and the sales of gas from MGC to NEP are not earned outside of the economic entity they are eliminated.) The consolidated income statement will also report all of the expenses that were incurred outside of the economic entity. (Since the purchases of electricity by MGC from NEP and the purchases of gas by NEP from MGC did not occur outside of the economic entity they are also eliminated.)
The consolidated balance sheet of NEP will report all of the cash, receivables, plant, etc. of the economic entity. It will also report all of the liabilities of the economic entity. (Amounts owed and receivable between NEP and MGC are eliminated in the consolidated balance sheet.)
This is a very brief overview of consolidated financial statements. It is a major topic within the university course and textbook entitled advanced accounting.",what
What is the difference between a balance sheet of a nonprofit organization and a for-profit business?,"A main difference is the section that presents the difference between the total assets and total liabilities. The nonprofit's statement of financial position refers to this section as net assets, whereas the for-profit business will refer to this section as owner's equity or stockholders' equity. The reason is the nonprofit does not have owners. This means that the nonprofit organization's statement of financial position will reflect this equation: assets – liabilities = net assets.
The net assets section will consist of the following parts: net assets without donor restrictions and net assets with donor restrictions. The amounts reported in each of these parts are obviously based on the donor's stipulations.",what
What is an intangible asset?,"An intangible asset is an asset that you cannot touch. Examples of intangible assets include  copyrights, patents, mailing lists, trademarks, brand names, domain names, and so on.
Often the market value of an intangible asset is far greater than the market value of a company's tangible assets such as its buildings and equipment.
Accounting principles require that intangible assets be reported on a company's balance sheet at cost or less. Since many intangible assets are not purchased, they may not have a reportable cost. As a result, many valuable intangible assets are not even reported as assets on the company's balance sheet.",what
What are interim financial statements?,"Interim financial statements for a corporation are the financial statements covering a period of less than one year. Often interim financial statements are issued for the quarters between the annual financial statements. The purpose is to give investors and other users updated information on the corporation's operations. Unlike the annual financial statements, the interim financial statements are usually unaudited and condensed. Therefore, it is wise to also read the previously issued and complete annual financial statements and reports.
In order for the interim income statement amounts to add up to the amounts reported in the official income statement for the year, it is necessary that the accounting practices in the interim financial statements be consistent with the accounting practices that will be followed in the annual financial statements.",what
What is the consistency principle?,"Definition of Consistency
In accounting, consistency requires that a company's financial statements follow the same accounting principles, methods, practices and procedures from one accounting period to the next. This allows the readers of the financial statements to make meaningful comparisons between years.
Consistency does allow a company to make a change to a more preferred accounting method. However, the change and its effects must be clearly disclosed for the benefit of the readers of the financial statements.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board refers to consistency as one of the characteristics or qualities that makes accounting information useful.
Example of Consistency
Let's assume that a U.S. corporation uses the FIFO cost flow assumption for valuing its inventory and determining its cost of goods sold. Due to the increasing cost of its materials, it concludes that LIFO will better indicate the company's true profit. In the year of the change from FIFO to LIFO (and in years when comparisons are presented), the company must disclose the break in consistency.",what
What is a compilation?,"Definition of Compilation
A compilation refers to a company's financial statements that have been prepared or compiled by an outside accountant. 
A compilation is usually part of an accounting firm's write-up service. With compilations, or compiled financial statements, the outside accountant converts the client's data into financial statements without providing any assurances or auditing services.
A compilation report should accompany the compiled financial statements to indicate that the financial statements 1) are the representation of the company's management, and 2) have not been reviewed or audited and therefore the accountant does not offer an opinion or any assurances on the financial statements.
Compilations allow companies without an accountant to have financial statements prepared by an outside professional without the higher cost of reviewed or audited financial statements.
Example of a Compilation
A company prepares its own monthly financial statements by using popular accounting software. However, as part of the company's loan agreement with its bank, the company must provide the bank with annual financial statements that have been compiled by a certified public accountant. (The bank does not require the borrower to incur the expense of a CPA's review or audit.)",what
What is a rolling budget?,"A rolling budget is also known as a continuous budget, a perpetual budget, or a rolling horizon budget. We will use the following example to explain the meaning of a rolling budget.
Let's assume that a company's accounting year ends on each December 31. Prior to the start of the year 2013, the company prepares its annual budget which is detailed by month for January through December 2013. This budget could become a rolling budget if after January 2013 the company drops the budget for January 2013 and adds the budget for January 2014. This rolling budget now covers the one year, or 12-month, period of February 1, 2013 through January 31, 2014. At the end of February 2013, the rolling budget will drop February 2013 and will add February 2014. At this point the rolling budget will cover the one year period of March 1, 2013 through February 29, 2014.
The benefit of a rolling budget is that the company's management will always have a budget that looks forward for one full year.
A rolling budget could use 3-month periods or quarters instead of months. Also, a company might have a 5-year rolling budget for capital expenditures. In this case a full year will be added to replace the year that has just ended. This 5-year rolling budget means that management will always have a 5-year planning horizon.",what
What is the debt to equity ratio?,"Definition of Debt to Equity Ratio
The debt to equity ratio or debt-equity ratio is the result of dividing a corporation's total liabilities by the total amount of stockholders' equity.
Expressed as a formula, the debt to equity ratio is: (Liabilities/Stockholders' Equity):1.
Generally, the higher the ratio of debt to equity, the greater is the risk for the corporation's creditors and prospective creditors.
Example of Debt to Equity Ratio
A corporation with $1,200,000 of liabilities and $2,000,000 of stockholders' equity will have a debt to equity ratio of 0.6:1. A corporation with total liabilities of $1,200,000 and stockholders' equity of $400,000 will have a debt to equity ratio of 3:1.",what
Is it okay to have negative amounts in the equity section of the balance sheet?,"Definition of Equity Section of the Balance Sheet
The equity section of the balance sheet is known as:

Owner's equity if it is a sole proprietorship. The amount may be reported as a single amount described as owner's capital. On the other hand, it is common for today's accounting software to show three amounts: owner's capital at the start of the year, current year net income, and current year draws by the owner.
Stockholders' equity if it is a corporation. The reported components may be paid-in capital, retained earnings, treasury stock, and accumulated other comprehensive income.

Examples of Negative Amounts in the Equity Section
If the current year's net income is reported as a separate line in the owner's equity or stockholders' equity sections of the balance sheet, a negative amount of net income must be reported. The negative net income occurs when the current year's revenues are less than the current year's expenses.
If the cumulative earnings minus the cumulative dividends declared result in a negative amount, there will be a negative amount of retained earnings. This negative (or positive) amount of retained earnings is reported as a separate line within stockholders' equity.
The owner's drawing account in a sole proprietorship will have a debit balance. Hence, if it is reported as a separate line, it is reported as a negative amount since the owner's equity section of the balance sheet normally has credit balances.
If a corporation has purchased its own shares of stock the cost is recorded as a debit in the account Treasury Stock. The debit balance will be reported as a negative amount in the stockholders' equity section, since this section normally has credit balances. 
Accumulated other comprehensive income can also be a negative (or positive) amount.",what
What is the statement of comprehensive income?,"Definition of Statement of Comprehensive Income
The statement of comprehensive income is one of the five financial statements required in a complete set of financial statements for distribution outside of a corporation.
The statement of comprehensive income covers the same period of time as the income statement and consists of two major sections:

Net income (or net earnings) from the company's income statement
Other comprehensive income, which consists of positive and/or negative amounts for foreign currency translation and hedges, and a few other items

The totals from each of the above sections are summed and are presented as comprehensive income.
(If a company does not have any item that meets the criteria of other comprehensive income, the statement of comprehensive income is not required.)
For a company with an item that is considered to be other comprehensive income, the statement of comprehensive income is usually a separate financial statement that is presented immediately following the income statement. (However, a company has the option to combine the income statement and the statement of comprehensive income into one continuous financial statement.)
The amount of net income will cause an increase in the stockholders' equity account Retained Earnings, while a loss will cause a decrease. 
The amount of other comprehensive income will cause an increase in the stockholders' equity account Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (while a negative amount will cause a decrease in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income).",what
What is periodicity in accounting?,"In accounting, periodicity means that accountants will assume that a company's complex and ongoing activities can be divided up and reported in annual, quarterly and monthly financial statements. For example, some earth-moving equipment may require two years to manufacture but the activities will be divided up and reported in quarterly financial statements. A similar situation occurs at a company that develops complex digital systems.
Even a company that manufactures small consumer products will have ongoing activities and costs that overlap two years or more. Again, the accountants will assume that the revenues and costs can be assigned or allocated to the appropriate accounting periods. Hence, the accountants will report the company's net income and cash flows for each accounting period (year, quarter, month, etc.) and the company's financial position at the end of each accounting period.
Periodicity is also known as the time period assumption.",what
What are the required financial statements?,"The required financial statements for U.S. business corporations are:

Statement of income. This financial statement is also known as the statement of operations, statement of earnings, or income statement. It reports the corporation's revenues, expenses, gains and losses (except for items stipulated as other comprehensive income) for a period of time such as a year, quarter, 13 months, etc.
Statement of comprehensive income. This financial statement begins with the bottom line of the income statement and then lists the items considered to be other comprehensive income. Some of these items involve currency translation, hedging, and pensions.
Balance sheet. This statement of financial position reports a corporation's assets, liabilities and stockholders' equity as of the final instant of the date shown in its heading (December 31, January 31, June 30, etc.)
Statement of cash flows. This statement reports the major causes for the change in cash and cash equivalents during the accounting period. The cash flows are presented as operating, investing, or financing activities.
Statement of stockholders' equity. This financial statement is often presented as the statement of shareholders' equity, statement of equity, statement of changes in stockholders' equity, etc. It reports all of the changes in stockholders' equity which occurred during the accounting period.

The five annual financial statements must be accompanied with notes to the financial statements. These notes are needed in order to disclose additional information about items that are reported or are not reported in the financial statements.
You can see examples of the required financial statements (and the required notes) for a publicly traded U.S. corporation by searching the Internet for the corporation's name plus the words investor relations. Select Annual Reports (or select SEC filings and annual reports or 10-K).",what
What is ERP?,"In accounting, ERP is the acronym for enterprise resource planning. ERP could be described as a database software package that supports all of a business's processes and operations including manufacturing, marketing, financial, human resources, and so on. In other words, the goal of ERP is to have one integrated system for the entire company.
The integration of all of a company's information from all departments, processes, operations, etc. requires that an ERP system be very sophisticated. This in turn requires a company to commit considerable resources for planning, training, and implementing an ERP system.
Two of the suppliers or vendors of major ERP systems are SAP and Oracle.",what
What is the difference between the Cash Flow and Funds Flow statements?,"The cash flow statement, known formally as the Statement of Cash Flows, reports a company's change in cash and cash equivalents from one balance sheet date to another. The cash flow statement classifies the amount of the change according to operating, investing, and financing activities. The cash flow statement has been required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board since 1988, when it issued its Statement No. 95. You can read about the statement of cash flows at www.FASB.org/st.
Prior to 1988, accountants prepared a funds flow statement. Generally, the funds flow statement reported on the change in working capital from one balance sheet date to another.",what
What is the difference between unearned revenue and unrecorded revenue?,"In financial accounting, unearned revenue refers to amounts received prior to being earned. For example, if ABC Service Co. receives $24,000 on December 31, 2012 for a one-year service agreement covering January 1 through December 31, 2013, the entire $24,000 is unearned as of December 31, 2012. On the December 31, 2012 balance sheet ABC should report a liability such as Unearned Revenues for $24,000. During 2013 ABC should move $2,000 per month from the liability account on its balance sheet to a revenue account on its income statement.
I associate unrecorded revenue with revenues that were earned, but not yet recorded in a company's accounting records. For example, an electric utility will provide electricity to customers for up to one month before it reads the customers' meters, calculates the bills and records the billings as revenues and accounts receivable. As a result, the electric utility will have up to one month of unrecorded revenue. At each balance sheet date, the utility should accrue for the revenues it earned but had not yet recorded. This is done through an adjusting entry that debits a balance sheet receivable account and credits an income statement revenue account.",what
What does it mean to report expenses by function?,"To report expenses by function means to report them according to the activity for which the expenses were incurred.
For a business, the reporting of expenses by function means the income statement will report expenses according to the following functional classifications: manufacturing, selling, general administrative, and financing.
For a not-for-profit organization, the reporting of expenses by function means the statement of activities will report expenses according to the following functional classifications: 1) each of its major programs, and 2) the supporting services which are a) management and general, b) fund-raising, and c) membership development. It will also present the expenses by nature, such as salaries, electricity, repairs, etc.
(Classifying expenses according to salaries, electricity, repairs, etc. is referred to as natural classifications, or classifying expenses by their nature.)",what
What is the cash flow statement?,"The cash flow statement is one of the main financial statements of a business or a nonprofit entity. (It is also known as the statement of cash flows.) The cash flow statement reports a company's major sources and uses of cash during the same period of time as the company's income statement. In other words, it lists the major reasons for the change in a company's cash and cash equivalents reported on the balance sheets at the beginning and the end of the accounting period.
The cash flow statement is needed because the income statement reports the revenues earned and the expenses incurred using the accrual method of accounting. These amounts are different from the amount of cash received and paid. Also, the company's annual income statements might report 3% of a new building's cost as depreciation expense, but the company may have paid cash for 100% of the building's cost in the year it was constructed. Since cash is critical for a company's operations and decision making, it is necessary to have the cash flow statement.
The cash flow statement is organized into four major sections: cash from operating activities, cash from investing activities, cash from financing activities, and supplemental information such as interest paid, income taxes paid, and significant noncash exchanges.",what
"What is the advantage of using historical cost on the balance sheet for property, plant and equipment?","The main advantage of using historical cost on the balance sheet for property, plant and equipment is that historical cost can be verified. Generally, the cost at the time of purchase is documented with contracts, invoices, payments, transfer taxes, and so on.
The historical cost of plant and equipment (not land) is also used to determine the amount of depreciation expense reported on the income statement. The accumulated amount of depreciation is also reported as a deduction from the assets' historical costs reported on the balance sheet. (In the case of impairment, some assets might be reported at less than the amounts based on historical cost.)
The use of historical cost is also a disadvantage to those users of the financial statements who want to know the current values.",what
Why are the amounts on the financial statements rounded to thousands or millions?,"Amounts on financial statements are often rounded in order to emphasize the important digits. As a result of rounding, the financial statements are more attractive in appearance which in turn makes them more inviting to read.
Rounding is important because corporations must present three years of figures on their income statements and cash flow statements and two years of figures on the balance sheet. For example, imagine looking at the income statement with the following sales amounts over the past three years: $1,512,989.63 $1,321,026.98 $1,265,876.22. Now look at the amounts rounded to the nearest thousand: $1,513 $1,321 $1,266. The rounded figures allow you to focus on the relevant digits. The rounded amounts also makes it easier for us to see the trend. Of course, you must label the financial statement with words such as ""Amounts rounded to 000's"" so that the reader understands the amounts shown.
Rounding of the less important digits is acceptable because of accountants' materiality principle  or guideline. The rounding is acceptable so long as the rounded amounts will not mislead a current or potential investor, lender, or other person making a decision from the reported information.",what
What is the difference between reserve and provision?,"In the U.S. the use of the word reserve has been discouraged for several decades. In its place, the accounting profession has recommended the use of words such as allowance, accumulated, or provision. For instance, many years ago the contra account to a plant asset may have been titled Depreciation Reserve. To some readers, that name implied that cash had been set aside to replace the asset. To better communicate reality, the accounting profession recommended a more descriptive title such as Accumulated Depreciation. Similarly, the contra account to Accounts Receivable may have been titled Reserve for Bad Debts. Again, that title could imply that money was set aside. To avoid misinterpretation, the accounting profession suggested Allowance for Bad Debts or Provision for Bad Debts.
The word provision might appear in the title of a contra account as we just noted. In addition, provision will occasionally appear in the title of an expense account, such as Provision for Income Taxes.",what
How do you account for bond issue costs?,"The costs associated with issuing bonds should be recorded in a contra liability account such as Bond Issue Costs. Over the life of the bonds you will need to systematically move the bond issue cost from the balance sheet to the income statement. Accountants refer to this as amortizing the costs.
Let's illustrate the amortization of bond issue costs by assuming the total of the bond issue costs were $24,000 and the bonds will mature in 10 years. Each month you would debit Interest Expense for $200 ($24,000 divided by 120 months) and would credit Bond Issue Costs for $200. The concept is to match the $24,000 cost to the accounting periods that are benefiting from the bonds having been issued.
Our discussion pertains to financial statement reporting and we are not familiar with income tax reporting. You should discuss the income tax treatment with your tax adviser.",what
Should inventories be reported at their cost or at their selling prices?,"Generally inventories are reported at their cost. A merchant's inventory would be reported at the merchant's cost to purchase the items. A manufacturer's inventory would be at its cost to produce the items (the cost of direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead).
However, if the net realizable value (NRV) of the inventory is less than the cost, the NRV will usually need to be reported on the balance sheet instead of the cost. Net realizable value is defined as the expected selling price in the ordinary course of business minus any costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. When the cost of the inventory is written down to its NRV, the amount of the write down is reported on the income statement. (In a few industries, such as gold mining and meatpacking, it is accepted practice to report the inventory at its net realizable value.)
Since the unit cost of items in inventory is likely to be changing (think inflation), the costs used for inventory reporting will be based on a cost flow assumption. For example, the FIFO cost flow assumption will result in the inventory being reported at the more recent costs, since the first costs are assumed to have been the first costs out of inventory. Under the LIFO cost flow assumption, the inventory will be valued at the older costs, since the more recent costs are assumed to be the first costs to flow out of inventory.",what
How much do you depreciate an asset and when?,"Depreciation begins when you place an asset in service and it ends when you take an asset out of service or when you have expensed its cost, whichever comes first.
For financial statements, you are guided by the matching principle. The objective is to match the cost of the asset to the accounting periods in which revenues were earned by using the asset. There are two estimates needed: 1) the number of years that the asset will be used, and 2) the salvage value at the end of the asset's use. If an asset has a cost of $100,000 and is expected to be used for 10 years and then have no salvage value, most companies will depreciate the asset at the rate of $10,000 per year. This is known as the straight line method of depreciation.
For income tax purposes in the U.S., the Internal Revenue Service has determined the number of years that various assets will be useful and it assumes there will be no salvage value. The IRS also allows companies to take larger depreciation deductions in the earlier years and smaller deductions in the later years of the assets' lives. This is known as accelerated depreciation.
As you probably noted from the above information, in any one year the depreciation expense on the financial statements will be different from the depreciation expense on the income tax return. However, over the life of an asset, the total depreciation expense will be the same. Accountants refer to this as a timing difference.",what
What is the statement of cash flows?,"The statement of cash flows is one of the main financial statements. It is to accompany the income statement, balance sheet, and statement of stockholders' equity. The statement of cash flows (also known as the cash flow statement) reports

the major sources and uses of cash during the period of the income statement
a reconciliation of the change in an organization's cash and cash equivalents (which are reported on the beginning and ending balance sheets)
supplementary information including the amount of income taxes paid, the amount of interest paid, and significant noncash investing and financing activities (such as issuing common stock in exchange for land)

The statement of cash flow is important because investors, lenders, financial analysts, and others are interested in an organization's major cash inflows and outflows. (This information is not available from the income statement because the accrual basis of accounting requires that revenues be reported when earned and expenses be reported when incurred.)
The statement of cash flows reports cash inflows as positive amounts and the cash outflows as negative amounts. They are reported in one of the three sections of the statement of cash flows: operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities.",what
What is the profit margin (after tax) ratio?,"The after tax profit margin ratio tells you the profit per sales dollar after all expenses are deducted from sales. In other words, the after tax profit margin ratio shows you the percentage of net sales that remains after deducting the cost of goods sold and all other expenses including income tax expense. The calculation is: Net Income after Tax divided by Net Sales.
The before tax profit margin ratio expresses the corporation's income before income tax expense as a percentage of net sales.
The profit margin ratio is most useful when it is compared to 1) the same company's profit margin ratios from earlier accounting periods, 2) the same company's targeted or planned profit margin ratio for the current accounting period, and 3) the profit margin ratios of other companies in the same industry during the same accounting period.",what
What is a deferred credit?,"A deferred credit could mean money received in advance of it being earned, such as deferred revenue, unearned revenue, or customer advances. A deferred credit could also result from complicated transactions where a credit amount arises, but the amount is not revenue.
A deferred credit is reported as a liability on the balance sheet. Depending on the specifics, the deferred credit might be a current liability or a noncurrent liability. In the past, it was common to see a noncurrent liability section with the heading Deferred Credits.",what
Which financial statement tells the value of a business?,"None of the financial statements will report the value of a business. The main financial statements (balance sheet, income statement, statement of cash flows, statement of stockholders' equity) may provide some helpful partial information, but they will not report the value of the business.
Two reasons why the value of a business is not included in the financial statements are:

The financial statements are generally based on the company's past recorded transactions. The value of the business will more likely be based on the perceived future transactions.
The accountants' cost principle prohibits a business from reporting some highly-valued assets such as trademarks, brand names, and an effective management team (assuming these were developed internally).

A contemporary example which demonstrates that the financial statements do not reflect the value of a business is a startup company with a promising future. We may have read that a venture capitalist (VC) invested $10 million in a startup. Based on that investment the startup is assumed to have a total value of $100 million. Well the startup's financial statements will not report amounts anywhere near $100 million. Realistically the financial statements will be reporting negative earnings, few assets and little stockholders' equity. The company's value came from the VC's perception of the company's new breakthrough system that is projected to generate amazing future revenues with a limited amount of expenses.
In short, the financial statements provide only some of the information needed when attempting to determine the value of a business.",what
Why does our company's balance sheet report its land at cost when it is so much more valuable?,"Accountants are guided by the cost principle. This requires accountants to report assets at their cost when acquired—not their replacement cost or market value. The historical cost is an objective amount that can easily be audited. In contrast, the market value is subjective: one person thinks the land is worth $1 million while another thinks it's worth $1.5 million.
Further support for the cost principle is the accountants' going concern assumption. A company is assumed to be continuing in business and will not be liquidating. If your company bought the land for possible expansion, its cost is more relevant than the amount the company could get if it were liquidating. After all your company is not liquidating. The revenue recognition principle would be another reason why market values are not reported.
(P.S. I should add that some businesses are required to report assets at market value. I believe those businesses are in industries with significant markets and verifiable quoted market prices.)",what
What is meant by events after the balance sheet date?,"Events after the balance sheet date are significant financial events that occur after the date of the balance sheet, but prior to the date that the financial statements are issued. For example, a company's balance sheet that has the heading of December 31, 2012 might not be finalized and distributed until February 1, 2013. During January new information may arise that has financial significance. Perhaps there is an event that provides more information about the conditions actually existing on December 31. The second type of event would be a new January event that does not change the December 31 amounts, but needs to be disclosed to the readers of the December 31 financial statements.
An example of the first situation might be that a customer owes Jay Company $200,000 on December 31 and Jay Company assumed that the customer was financially sound. As a result Jay Company did not provide any allowance for the customer's account being uncollectible. Then on January 28, the customer filed for bankruptcy and Jay Company learns that none of the $200,000 receivable will be collected. If the customer's financial condition on December 31 was already in bankruptcy condition, Jay Company will need to adjust its December 31 balance sheet and its income statement for the year 2012 for this $200,000 of bad debts expense.
An example of the second situation might be a loss arising from a catastrophe occurring on January 16, 2013. The amounts reported as of December 31, 2012 will not be adjusted since those amounts were correct as of December 31. However, the readers of the December 31 balance sheet and the 2012 income statement should be informed through a disclosure that something significant has occurred to the company's financial position since December 31.
The events after the balance sheet date are often referred to as subsequent events or post balance sheet events.",what
"Is contributed capital a noncurrent asset or a current asset, and is it a debit or credit?","The account Contributed Capital is part of stockholders' equity and it will have a credit balance. Contributed capital is also referred to as paid-in capital.
When a corporation issues shares of its stock for cash, the corporation's current asset Cash will increase with the debit part of the entry, and the account Contributed Capital will increase with the credit part of the entry. If the corporation then uses some of its cash to purchase equipment, its current asset Cash will decrease and its noncurrent asset Equipment will increase.
If a corporation receives equipment in exchange for newly issued shares of stock, the noncurrent asset Equipment will increase and Contributed Capital will increase.",what
What is the difference between reserve and allowance?,"More than 60 years ago, accountants in the U.S. used Reserve for Bad Debts as the title of the contra account associated with Accounts Receivable or Loans Receivable. They also used Reserve for Depreciation as the title of the contra account associated with plant assets. The use of the word reserve led some readers of the financial statements to conclude that money was set aside for replacing plant assets or the uncollectible accounts or loans. To avoid this misunderstanding, the accounting profession recommended that the word reserve have a very limited use. Accountants now use Allowance for Doubtful Accounts or Allowance for Bad Debts instead of Reserve for Bad Debts. In the case of plant assets, Accumulated Depreciation is used in place of Reserve for Depreciation.",what
Where can I find the amount of income taxes paid by a corporation?,"You can find the amount of income taxes paid by a corporation by reading its statement of cash flows and its notes to the financial statements.
US GAAP requires corporations to report the amount of income taxes paid. The AICPA's Accounting Trend and Techniques indicates that approximately half of the 500 large corporations that it surveyed had reported the amount of income taxes paid at the bottom of the statement of cash flows. Almost the same number had reported the amount of income taxes paid in its notes to the financial statements. Only 5 or 6 corporations had reported the amount within its statement of cash flows. For U.S. corporations whose stock is publicly-traded, you will find the statement of cash flows included in its Form 10-K, which is the annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
It is important to understand that the income tax provision reported on the income statement is not the amount of income taxes paid in that period.",what
Where do I record the refund of a registration fee?,"If the registration fee refers to a fee expense that you had originally paid but the amount is now being refunded to you, I would credit the same expense account that you had originally charged or debited, and would debit Cash.
If the registration fee refers to an amount you are refunding because someone had originally registered for one of your programs, I would 1) credit Cash for the amount you are paying out as the refund, and 2) debit a contra-revenue account such as Refunds of Registration Fee Revenues. This will allow you to easily track the total amounts of refunds that you make during a year. On the other hand, if it is rare for your organization to refund registration fees, you could simply 1) debit the amount you are refunding to the normal revenue account such as Registration Fee Revenues, and 2) credit Cash.",what
What is a comparative balance sheet?,"A comparative balance sheet usually has two columns of amounts that appear to the right of the account titles or other descriptions such as Cash and Cash Equivalents, Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable, etc. The first column of amounts contains the amounts as of a recent moment or point in time, say December 31, 2012. To the right will be a column containing corresponding amounts from an earlier date, such as December 31, 2011. The older amounts appear further from the account titles or descriptions as the older amounts are less important.
Providing the amounts from an earlier date gives the reader of the balance sheet a point of reference—something to which the recent amounts can be compared.",what
Can a fully depreciated asset be revalued?,"A fully depreciated asset cannot be revalued because of accounting's cost principle.
Definition of a Fully Depreciated Asset
A fully depreciated asset is one that has accumulated depreciation equal to its cost. Hence, the book value of the asset is $0. Once an asset is fully depreciated, there will be no additional depreciation expense.
Example of a Fully Depreciated Asset
Let's assume that a company purchased a building more than 30 years ago at a cost of $600,000. The company then depreciated the building at a rate of $20,000 per year for 30 years. Today the building continues to be used by the company and it plans to continue using it for many more years. The company's current balance sheet will report the building at its cost of $600,000 minus its accumulated depreciation of $600,000 (a book value of $0) even if the building's current market value is $2,000,000.
Unless there are improvements to the building, there will be no depreciation expense after the 30th year.",what
What is IFRS?,"IFRS is the acronym for International Financial Reporting Standards. IFRS is used throughout the world except in the United States where U.S. GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) is followed.
There is an urgency for the U.S. to adopt the IFRS because of the growth in global financial markets, global commerce, acquisition of U.S. companies by corporations outside of the U.S., multinational corporations having subsidiaries both inside and outside of the U.S., and so on. Since financial statements report two or three years of amounts, the amounts from earlier years will need to follow IFRS in order to be comparative.
Efforts are also under way for a simplified version of IFRS that would apply for small and medium sized privately held corporations.",what
What are consolidated statements of operations?,"Consolidated statements of operations is the heading appearing on the financial statement also referred to as the income statement. In a small survey of 14 U.S. corporations with stock that is publicly-traded, I found that eight used the title consolidated statements of operations. The other six corporations used one of the following titles: consolidated statements of income, consolidated statements of earnings, or consolidated results of operations. In the case of smaller corporations and sole proprietorships, you will more likely see the heading income statements. Seasoned business owners often refer to this financial statement as the P&L, which is short for profit and loss statement.
The word statements (instead of statement) is used in the heading because publicly-traded U.S. corporations are required to present the income statements for each of their most recent three accounting years.
The term consolidated is used in the heading of the financial statements when the corporation controls several separate legal entities but is reporting the results as one economic entity.",what
Why does a company's profit appear as a credit on its balance sheet?,"The accounting equation and the double entry system provide an explanation why a company's profit appears as a credit on its balance sheet.
Asset accounts usually have debit balances while liabilities and owner's or stockholders' equity usually have credit balances. When a company provides services for cash, its asset Cash is increased by a debit and its owner's equity is increased by a credit. The credit is initially recorded in a revenue account, but revenue accounts are temporary accounts that cause owner's equity to increase.
If the owner withdraws some cash for personal use, the asset Cash will decrease through a credit and the owner's equity will decrease through the debit part of the accounting entry. The debit might initially be recorded in the sole proprietor's Drawing account but this account is also a temporary account that will cause the owner's equity to decrease.
Generally speaking, the credit balance reported in the owner's or stockholders' equity section of the balance sheet reflects the owners' investments in the company plus the profits earned minus the amounts distributed to the owners since the time that the company began.",what
What is the transaction approach and balance sheet approach to measuring net income?,"The transaction approach to measuring net income is the traditional bookkeeping and accounting method. That is, individual transactions such as each sale, each purchase, and every expense are recorded into general ledger accounts. At any point you can go to an account such as Salaries Expense for Sales Staff and see the year to date amount of such an expense. With the use of accounting software, an enormous quantity of transactions can be recorded into many detailed accounts.
I believe that the balance sheet approach is also referred to as the capital maintenance approach. Under the balance sheet approach one looks at the change in stockholders' or owner's equity to determine the amount of net income during the period between balance sheets. This approach requires that you exclude any additional capital from the owners as well as any dividends or withdrawals distributed to the owners. For example, if stockholders' equity increased by $5 million with $2 million caused by the issuance of new shares of stock, and $1 million distributed as dividends, the net income would have been $4 million. We can verify the calculation with the following:  net income of $4 (an addition to equity) plus new investor money of $2 (an addition to equity) = $6 of additions to equity, minus dividends of  $1 (a decrease to equity) = $5 (the net increase to equity). Under this balance sheet approach you will not have the detailed information on revenues and expenses that would be available under the transaction approach.",what
What is a natural business year?,"A natural business year is the period of 12 consecutive months (or 52-53 consecutive weeks) ending at a low point of an organization's activities. For example, a school district will have a natural business year of July 1 through June 30, since classes for the school year end in early June.
A retailer's natural business year might be the 52-53 consecutive weeks ending on the Saturday closest to each February 1. This is a low point of activity as it follows the retailer's holiday season and its January clearance sales. The 52-53 week periods (instead of 12 month periods) will result in an equal number of Saturdays in most of the natural business years (as well as in the 13-week quarters and in the 4-5 week months).
Many companies have a natural business year of January 1 through December 31. On the other hand, some companies are required by government regulations to end their accounting years on December 31, even though it is not the end of their natural business year.
The term fiscal year is associated with companies having financial reporting years that do not end on December 31.",what
Is the direct method still used in the statement of cash flows?,"The direct method of preparing the statement of cash flows is recommended by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). However, the direct method is rarely used.
Recent editions of Accounting Trends & Techniques published by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants surveyed 500 annual reports and found that less than 10 used the direct method, while more than 490 used the indirect method.
You can read the official FASB pronouncement on the Statement of Cash Flows at www.FASB.org/st.",what
What is a comparative income statement?,"A comparative income statement will consist of two or three columns of amounts appearing to the right of the account titles or descriptions. For example, the income statement for the year 2012 will report the amounts for each of the years 2012, 2011, and 2010. As a courtesy to the reader, the amounts from the most recent period are in the column closest to the titles. The older amounts are deemed to be less significant and thus appear furthest from the titles.
A comparative income statement gives the reader a frame of reference for comparing the current year amounts.",what
What is the statement of stockholders' equity?,"Definition of the Statement of Stockholders' Equity
The statement of stockholders' equity (also known as the statement of shareholders' equity, statement of equity,
statement of changes in stockholders' equity, statement of changes in shareholders' equity, and statement of changes in equity) is one of the five required financial statements issued by a U.S. corporation whose common stock is publicly traded. This financial statement summarizes on one page all of the changes that occurred in the stockholders' equity accounts during the accounting year.
Examples of the Columns Often Appearing on the Statement
The statement usually has the following columns into which the amounts will be sorted:

Common stock issued - number of shares
Common stock issued - total par value
Additional paid-in capital - common stock
Treasury stock - number of shares
Treasury stock - total cost
Retained earnings
Accumulated other comprehensive income or loss
Total stockholders' equity

Examples of the Descriptions for the Rows or Lines Appearing on the Statement
Some typical descriptions for the amounts being reported include:

Beginning balances
Net earnings or loss
Other comprehensive income or detailed amounts
Stock-based compensation
Exercise of stock options
Sale of common stock
Repurchase of common stock
Cash dividends declared
Ending balances

To see a statement of stockholders' equity, search the internet by entering a corporation's name and the words investor relations 10-K. From the website select annual filings for Form 10-K. Choose the PDF format. Approximately half way down on the table of contents you will see Financial Statements. When you review the statement of stockholders' equity you will see that it reports the amounts for each of the most recent three years.",what
The balance sheet and income statement are connected.,"In the tip of April 20, I mentioned that adjusting entries almost always involve both a balance sheet account and an income statement account. (For example, the cost of supplies that are no longer on hand is moved from the balance sheet to supplies expense on the income statement. Insurance premiums that are no longer prepaid are moved from the balance sheet to insurance expense on the income statement.) The first accounting course teaches us that the basic accounting equation is Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity. Owner's Equity or Stockholders' Equity is a section of the balance sheet that increases when the company's net income increases.
The point of these observations is the following tip: The number of balance sheet accounts is usually small in relation to the number of income statement accounts. If you can be certain that the relatively few balance sheet accounts have the correct ending balances, you can have some confidence that the bottom line of the income statement is proper. (The income statement may contain errors—perhaps you entered an amount into the wrong account—but the overall net income has a good chance of being correct.)
I received this tip from a CPA named Bob many years ago, when he helped me to delegate some accounting work. I continue to value his insight.",what
What is inflation accounting?,"In the U.S., inflation accounting has resulted in optional supplementary disclosures on the effects of 1) general inflation, and 2) changes in the prices of specific types of assets. In other words, the main financial statements continue to report only the traditional, historical cost amounts without any adjustment for changing prices. [During the years 1979 to 1985, some supplementary disclosures on the effects of changing prices had to be included in the notes to the financial statements of the very large U.S. corporations. From 1986 until today, the supplementary disclosures are optional. Hence, the disclosures are not likely to be made.]
One reason that inflation accounting is now optional for U.S. corporations is that the U.S. inflation rate has been modest or low since 1983. Another reason is the belief that the cost of computing the disclosure amounts will be greater than the benefit to the readers of the financial statements.
To illustrate the logic of inflation accounting, let's assume that the general inflation rate and the changes in the costs of specific assets are increasing at a constant rate of 10% each year. This means that a power plant built for a cost of $1 billion will cost $10 billion at the end of a useful life of 25 years. By computing straight-line depreciation based on the historical cost, the income statement will report depreciation expense of $40 million per year ($1 billion/25 years). Obviously this is much lower than the current cost of the productive capacity being used up each year.
Similarly, if a retailer's cost of items in inventory is increasing at an annual rate of 10%, the cost of goods sold reported on the income statement (based on historical costs) will be less than the cost the company will spend in order to replace the units sold.
The use of historical costs during periods of increasing prices means that companies with large amounts of plant assets and inventory will be reporting net income that is greater than the true economic profit. As a result, the reported net income during inflationary periods is said to include illusory profit.",what
Are liabilities always a bad thing?,"Liabilities are obligations and are usually defined as a claim on assets. However, liabilities and stockholders' equity are also the sources of assets. Generally, liabilities are considered to have a lower cost than stockholders' equity. On the other hand, too many liabilities result in additional risk.
Some liabilities have low interest rates and some have no interest associated with them. For example, some of a company's accounts payable may allow payment in 30 days. With those payables it is better to have the liability and to keep your cash in the bank until they become due.
In our personal lives, our first house was probably purchased with a down payment and mortgage loan. That mortgage loan was a big liability, but it allowed us to upgrade our living space. I viewed my mortgage loan liability as a good thing because it allowed me to own a nice home in a beautiful neighborhood.
So some liabilities are good—especially the ones that have a very low interest rate. Too many liabilities could cause financial hardships.",what
Where can I find a sample of a cash flow statement?,"A cash flow statement or statement of cash flows should be presented with a U.S. corporation's annual financial statements.
If a corporation's stock is publicly traded, the statement of cash flows will be included in its annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Form 10-K.
To assist with the preparation of a cash flow statement, we have the following forms and templates:",what
Why isn't a key employee reported as an asset on the balance sheet?,"While an employee could be an organization's most valuable asset, accountants record past transactions that can be measured.
Since an employee is not purchased, there is no past transaction and cost that the accountant can record in order to report this person as an asset owned by the entity. The salary and bonuses paid to a key employee are reported as expenses in the period in which the employee performed services.
Not being able to record a valuable employee as an asset is similar to a valuable brand name developed internally by a company over time. Since the brand name was not purchased from another entity, there is no past transaction and purchase cost to be recorded.
I assume that an entity's payment made to another professional sports team for a professional athlete's services for the next three years will result in recording the payment as an asset—a prepaid expense or deferred charge—that will then be amortized to expense over the three year contract.",what
Does the income statement explain the change in the equity section of a balance sheet?,"The income statement could explain the change in the equity section of a balance sheet. However, there are likely to be some other explanations as well.
Here is a list of the items that would cause an increase in the total amount of a corporation's stockholders' equity:

Positive net earnings or net income reported on the corporation's income statement.
Some positive Other Comprehensive Income items occurred but they are not to be reported on the income statement.
Additional shares of stock were issued in exchange for cash or other assets.
Donated capital was received.

Here is a list of items that could cause a decrease in the total amount of a corporation's stockholders' equity:

Negative net earnings or a net loss reported on the corporation's income statement.
Some negative Other Comprehensive Income items occurred but they are not to be reported the income statement.
The corporation declared cash dividends.

To see all of the explanations for the change in the equity section of a balance sheet, you should review the statement of stockholders' equity. This financial statement should be issued along with a corporation's balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows.",what
What is the rationale for not reporting plant assets at their liquidation value?,"I will assume that the plant assets' liquidation values are higher than the present carrying values when answering your question.
Plant assets (buildings and equipment used in manufacturing; also called fixed assets) are not reported at their higher liquidation value because of several accounting principles. Below are four accounting principles that come to mind.
The cost principle requires that plant assets be reported at amounts that are not greater than cost. Cost is an objective and verifiable amount. Liquidation value is subjective and the amount can vary significantly depending on the assumptions made.
The matching principle requires that the cost of plant assets be allocated to depreciation expense. This means that over a plant asset's useful life some of the plant asset cost is matched with revenues on the income statement. Therefore the plant asset's carrying amount will be decreasing each period.
The going concern assumption implies that the company will be continuing in business. Since it is assumed that the company is not liquidating, the liquidation value of the plant assets is not relevant.
The revenue recognition principle prohibits a company from showing a gain from merely holding a plant asset. What would you credit if you increased the plant asset amount?
Those four accounting principles provide some of the rationale for not reporting the liquidation value when it is higher than cost.
If a company is not a going concern or if the plant asset's value has been impaired, the above rationale does not hold. For those situations you will need to follow the appropriate accounting rules.",what
What does NOI stand for?,"NOI is the acronym for net operating income. Net operating income is also referred to as income from operations.

"If a company issues stocks or bonds to pay outstanding debt, should this noncash transaction be included in the cash flow statement?","If a company issues stocks or bonds for cash and then pays off the debt, the transaction is reported in the financing section of the statement of cash flows.
If the transaction is a direct conversion of debt to equity (shares of stock) or debt to bonds and no cash receipts or cash payments occur, the transaction is to be disclosed as supplementary information.
This situation and other noncash financing and investing activities are described in Paragraph 32 of the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows, available at www.FASB.org/st.",what
What is accounting for price level changes?,"In 1979 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued its Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 33 entitled Financial Reporting and Changing Prices. (You will find the original Statement No. 33 on www.FASB.org.) In short, Statement No. 33 required large companies to report supplementary information on the effects of changing prices on its inventory and its property, plant and equipment. (In the late 1970's the U.S. was experiencing double-digit inflation rates and the SEC was advocating the reporting of replacement cost.)
One disclosure required by Statement 33 was the reporting of the effects of general inflation as indicated by the change in the consumer price index. In other words, a large company had to disclose in the notes to its financial statements some key amounts after adjusting inventory and property, plant and equipment amounts for the changes in the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar. The second disclosure reported the effects of the changes in the specific prices of inventory and property, plant and equipment.
In 1986 the FASB issued its Statement No. 89 which no longer required the reporting of the information. As a result, most companies stopped the calculations and reporting. Two of the factors in deciding to stop the calculations was the lack of use by financial analysts and a decline in the rates of inflation in the U.S. In other words, the accounting for price level changes failed to pass the cost/benefit test.",what
What is credit analysis and financial analysis?,"Credit analysis is associated with the decision to grant credit to a customer. It is also part of a bank's lending procedures for making a loan and monitoring the borrower's creditworthiness.
I believe that financial analysis has a broader focus than credit analysis. Financial analysis would also include calculations such as return on equity, return on assets, price earnings ratios, dividend yield, comparisons with industry averages, trend analysis, and so on. Financial analysis would often be associated with investors, management, and creditors.",what
What are the disclosures for a manufacturer's inventory?,"A manufacturer should disclose the following categories of inventory: raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods, manufacturing supplies, and packaging supplies. When some of these amounts are not significant, some categories may be combined, such as raw materials and supplies, or raw materials and work-in-process.
In addition, a manufacturer (and others with inventory) should disclose the method for valuing the inventory. This includes whether it is cost or the lower of cost or net realizable value, and also the cost flow assumption such as 1) first-in, first-out or FIFO, 2) last-in, first-out or LIFO, 3) weighted average, etc. If LIFO is used, the company must disclose what the dollar amount of inventory would have been if FIFO had been used.",what

Which financial statement shows a corporation's worth?,"Not one of the financial statements will show a corporation's worth. The balance sheet, income statement, statement of cash flows, and stockholders' equity statement merely provide information to assist financial experts in forming an opinion of a corporation's worth.
In the past, some people mistakenly thought that a corporation's stockholders' equity was the corporation's worth. However, stockholders' equity (or the owner's equity of a proprietorship) is merely the result of subtracting the reported amount of liabilities from the reported amount of assets. Since the reported amounts reflect the cost principle and other accounting principles, the net result cannot be assumed to be the company's worth.",what

What is a calendar year?,"Definition of Calendar Year
A calendar year is the 12 consecutive months from January through December. In other words, it is the 365 days (366 days in a leap year) beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31.
Example of Calendar Years
In the U.S., individuals file their personal income tax returns based on the calendar year of January 1 through December 31. Many U.S. corporations also have accounting and income tax years that coincide with the calendar year of January 1 through December 31. However, U.S. corporations may have an accounting year and income tax year that is not a calendar year. 
Examples of Non-calendar Years
If a U.S. corporation has a non-calendar accounting year, it is referred to as a fiscal year.
An example is a U.S. retailer whose financial statements report the amounts for the fiscal year covering the 52-week period of Sunday, February 4, 2018 through Saturday, February 3, 2019. 
Often educational institutions have fiscal years that begin on July 1 and end on the following June 30.",what
How do you calculate the payback period?,"Definition of Payback Period
The payback period is the expected number of years it will take for a company to recoup the cash it invested in a project.
Examples of Payback Periods
Let's assume that a company invests cash of $400,000 in more efficient equipment. The cash savings from the new equipment is expected to be $100,000 per year for 10 years. The payback period is expected to be 4 years ($400,000 divided by $100,000 per year).
A second project requires a cash investment of $200,000 and it generates cash as follows:

Year 1: $20,000
Year 2: $60,000
Year 3: $80,000
Year 4: $100,000
Year 5: $70,000

The payback period is 3.4 years ($20,000 + $60,000 + $80,000 = $160,000 in the first three years + $40,000 of the $100,000 occurring in Year 4).
Note that the payback calculation uses cash flows, not net income. Also, the payback calculation does not address a project's total profitability over its entire life, nor are the cash flows discounted for the time value of money.",what
What is the difference between gross margin and markup?,"Definition of Gross Margin
Gross margin or gross profit is defined as net sales minus the cost of goods sold. 
However, some people intend for the term gross margin to mean the gross margin as a percentage of sales (or percentage of selling price). Others will use the term gross margin ratio to mean the gross margin as percentage of sales or selling price.
Example of Gross Margin
If a retailer sells a product for $10, and its cost was $8, the gross profit or gross margin is $2. 
The gross margin ratio is 20%, which is the gross profit or gross margin of $2 divided by the selling price of $10.
Definition of Markup
Markup in dollars is the difference between a product's cost and its selling price. [Note: some retailers may use the term markup to mean an additional markup from an earlier selling price.]
The markup is also expressed as a percentage of cost (not selling price).
Example of Markup
Assume that a product has a cost of $8 and the seller sets a selling price of $10. In dollars, the markup is $2 (the same as the $2 gross profit).
However, the markup is usually expressed as a percentage of the product's cost (not its selling price). Therefore, the $2 markup divided by the product's cost of $8 results in a markup that is 25% of cost.
Thus, if a retailer wants its income statement to show a gross profit that is 20% of sales, the retailer must mark up its products' costs by 25%.",what
What is financial leverage?,"Definition of Financial Leverage
Financial leverage which is also known as leverage or trading on equity, refers to the use of debt to acquire additional assets.
The use of financial leverage to control a greater amount of assets (by borrowing money) will cause the returns on the owner's cash investment to be amplified. That is, with financial leverage:

an increase in the value of the assets will result in a larger gain on the owner's cash, when the loan interest rate is less than the rate of increase in the asset's value
a decrease in the value of the assets will result in a larger loss on the owner's cash

Examples of Financial Leverage
Mary uses $500,000 of her cash to purchase 40 acres of land with a total cost of $500,000. Mary is not using financial leverage.
Sue uses $500,000 of her cash and borrows $1,000,000 to purchase 120 acres of land having a total cost of $1,500,000. Sue is using financial leverage to own/control $1,500,000 of property with only $500,000 of her own money. Let's also assume that the interest on Sue's loan is $50,000 per year and it is paid at the beginning of each year.
Effects of Using Financial Leverage
For our examples let's assume that after one year, the land owned by Mary and the land owned by Sue increased in value by 20% and both Mary and Sue sold their land investments at the market values. As a result:

Mary's land will sell for $600,000 which results in a gain of $100,000 (selling price of $600,000 minus the land's cost of $500,000). The $100,000 gain on Mary's cash of $500,000 results in a gain of 20% on Mary's $100,000 
Sue's land will sell for $1,800,000 which results in a gain of $250,000 (selling price of $1,800,000 minus $1,550,000, which is the land's cost of $1,500,000 and interest of $50,000). The $250,000 gain on Sue's $550,000 of cash is a gain of 45% instead of a gain of 20% without the use of leverage

Now let's assume that after one year, the land owned by Mary and and the land owned by Sue decreased in value by 20% and that both Mary and Sue sold their land investments at the market values. As a result:

Mary's land will sell for $400,000 which means a $100,000 loss on the land's cost of $500,000. The $100,000 loss on Mary's cash of $500,000 results in a 20% loss on Mary's money
Sue's land will sell for $1,200,000 which results in a loss of $350,000 (selling price of $1,200,000 minus the land's cost of $1,500,000 and interest of $50,000). The $350,000 loss on Sue's cash of $550,000 results in a 63.6% loss on Sue's money instead of a loss of 20% without the use of leverage",what
What is the debt to total assets ratio?,"Definition of Debt to Total Assets Ratio
The debt to total assets ratio is an indicator of a company's financial leverage. It tells you the percentage of a company's total assets that were financed by creditors. In other words, it is the total amount of a company's liabilities divided by the total amount of the company's assets.
Note: Debt includes more than loans and bonds payable. Debt is the total amount of all liabilities (current liabilities and long-term liabilities).
Example of Debt to Total Assets Ratio
Let's assume that a corporation has $100 million in total assets, $40 million in total liabilities, and $60 million in stockholders' equity. This corporation's debt to total assets ratio is 0.4 ($40 million of liabilities divided by $100 million of assets), 0.4 to 1, or 40%. This indicates 40% of the corporation's assets are being financed by the creditors, and the owners are providing 60% of the assets' cost. Generally, the higher the debt to total assets ratio, the greater the financial leverage and the greater the risk.
How To Be Used
As with all financial ratios, it is best for a company to compare its debt to total assets ratio to:

its ratio at an earlier date
its targeted ratio...its goal
the ratios at companies in the same industry",what
What is the difference between vertical analysis and horizontal analysis?,"Definition of Vertical Analysis
Vertical analysis expresses each amount on a financial statement as a percentage of another amount.

The vertical analysis of a balance sheet results in every balance sheet amount being restated as a percent of total assets.
The vertical analysis of an income statement results in every income statement amount being restated as a percent of net sales.

Example of Vertical Analysis of a Balance Sheet
If a company's inventory is $100,000 and its total assets are $400,000 the inventory will be expressed as 25% ($100,000 divided by $400,000). If cash is $8,000 then it will be presented as 2%($8,000 divided by $400,000). The total of the assets' percentages will add up to 100%. If the accounts payable are $88,000 they will be restated as 22% ($88,000 divided by $400,000). If owner's equity is $240,000 it will be shown as 60% ($240,000 divided by $400,000). The sum of the liabilities and owner's equity will also be 100%. The vertical analysis of the balance sheet will result in a common-size balance sheet. The percentages on a common-size balance sheet allow you to compare a small company's balance sheets to that of a very large company's balance sheet. A common-size balance sheet can also be compared to the average percentages for the industry.
Example of Vertical Analysis of an Income Statement
If a company's net sales were $1,000,000 they will be presented as 100% ($1,000,000 divided by $1,000,000). If the cost of goods sold amount is $780,000 it will be presented as 78% ($780,000 divided by sales of $1,000,000). If interest expense is $50,000 it will be presented as 5% ($50,000 divided by $1,000,000). The restated amounts result in a common-size income statement, since it can be compared to the income statement of a competitor of any size or to the industry's percentages.
Definition of Horizontal Analysis
Horizontal analysis looks at amounts from the financial statements over a horizon of many years. Horizontal analysis is also referred to as trend analysis. The amounts from past financial statements will be restated to be a percentage of the amounts from a base year. 
Examples of Horizontal Analysis
To illustrate horizontal analysis, let's assume that a base year is five years earlier. All of the amounts on the balance sheets and the income statements will be expressed as a percentage of the base year amounts. The amounts from five years earlier are presented as 100% or simply 100. The amounts from the most recent years will be divided by the base year amounts. For instance, if a most recent year amount was three times as large as the base year, the most recent year will be presented as 300. If the previous year's amount was twice the amount of the base year, it will be presented as 200. Seeing the horizontal analysis of every item allows you to more easily see the trends. It will be easy to detect that over the years the cost of goods sold has been increasing at a faster pace than the company's net sales. From the balance sheet's horizontal analysis you may see that inventory and accounts payable have been growing as a percentage of total assets.
Vertical analysis, horizontal analysis and financial ratios are part of financial statement analysis.",what
What is a current asset?,"Definition of Current Asset
A current asset is a company's cash and its other assets that are expected to be converted to cash within one year of the date appearing in the heading of the company's balance sheet. However, if a company has an operating cycle that is longer than one year, an asset that is expected to turn to cash within that longer operating cycle will be a current asset.
Current assets are usually presented first on the company's balance sheet and they are arranged in their order of liquidity.
Current assets are also a key component of a company's working capital and the current ratio.
Examples of Current Assets
Examples of current assets and the typical order of liquidity include:

Cash and cash equivalents (which includes currency, checking accounts, petty cash, some U.S. Treasury Bills)
Temporary investments
Accounts receivable
Inventory
Supplies
Prepaid expenses",what
What is the gross margin ratio?,"Definition of Gross Margin Ratio
The gross margin ratio is a percentage resulting from dividing the amount of a company's gross profit by the amount of its net sales. (The gross margin ratio is also known as the gross profit margin or the gross profit percentage or simply the gross margin.)
Companies should be continuously monitoring its gross margin ratio to be certain it is sufficient to cover its selling, general and administrative expenses, interest expense, and to earn a profit.
Example of Gross Margin Ratio
To illustrate the gross margin ratio, let's assume that a company has net sales of $800,000 and its cost of goods sold is $600,000. As a result, its gross profit is $200,000 (net sales of $800,000 minus its cost of goods sold of $600,000) and its gross margin ratio is 25% (gross profit of $200,000 divided by net sales of $800,000).
Note: Gross margin ratios vary between industries. Therefore, you should compare a company's gross margin ratio to other companies in the same industry and to its own past ratios or its planned ratios.",what
What is the average collection period?,"Definition of Average Collection Period
The average collection period is the average number of days between 1) the dates that credit sales were made, and 2) the dates that the money was received/collected from the customers. The average collection period is also referred to as the days' sales in accounts receivable.
Formula for Calculating the Average Collection Period
One formula for calculating the average collection period is: 365 days in a year divided by the accounts receivable turnover ratio.
An alternate formula for calculating the average collection period is: the average accounts receivable balance divided by the  average credit sales per day.
Example of Average Collection Period
Assume that a company had on average $40,000 of accounts receivable during the most recent year. During that year the company had credit sales of $400,000.
One calculation of the average collection period is to first determine the accounts receivable turnover ratio, which is $400,0000 divided by $40,000 = 10 times per year. Since there were 365 days during the recent year, the average collection period is 365 days divided by the turnover ratio of 10 = 36.5 days.
Using the alternate formula we first determine the average credit sales per day, which is the $400,000 of credit sales divided by 365 days = $1,096. Next, the average accounts receivable balance of $40,000 is divided by the average credit sales per day of $1,096, which also results in 36.5 days.
The monitoring of the average collection period is one way to track a company's ability to collect its accounts receivable.",what
What is the difference between gross margin and contribution margin?,"Definition of Gross Margin
Some use the term gross margin to mean the same as gross profit, which is: net sales minus the cost of goods sold. Others use the term gross margin to indicate the gross profit as a percentage of net sales.
The cost of goods sold will consist of both fixed and variable product costs. However, selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) are not part of the cost of goods sold. 
Definition of Contribution Margin
Contribution margin is defined as net sales minus both the variable product costs and the variable SG&A expenses. The contribution margin can also be expressed as a percentage of net sales. In that case it is often described as the contribution margin ratio.
Information for Examples
Let's assume that a company had the following amounts during the past year:

Net sales of $600,000
Cost of goods sold of $320,000 ($120,000 variable + $200,000 of fixed)
Inventories did not increase or decrease
SG&A expenses of $190,000 ($40,000 variable + $150,000 fixed)

Example of Gross Margin
The company's gross margin is: net sales of $600,000 minus the cost of goods sold of $320,000 = $280,000. The gross margin or gross profit percentage is: gross profit of $280,000 divided by net sales of $600,000 = 46.7%.
Example of Contribution Margin
The company's contribution margin is: net sales of $600,000 minus the variable product costs of $120,000 and the variable expenses of $40,000 = $440,000. The contribution margin ratio is 73.3% ($440,000 divided by $600,000).",what
What is a current liability?,"Definition of Current Liability
A current liability is:

An obligation that will be due within one year of the date of the company's balance sheet, and
Will require the use of a current asset or will create another current liability

However, if a company's normal operating cycle is longer than one year, current liabilities are the obligations that will be due within the operating cycle.
Current liabilities are usually reported as a separate section of a company's balance sheet. This allows readers to subtract their total from the company's total amount of current assets in order to determine a company's working capital. (Dividing current assets by the current liabilities is the company's current ratio.)
Examples of Current Liabilities
The following are common examples of current liabilities:

Accounts payable or trade payables
Notes payable that will be due within one year
The principal portion of a long-term loan that must be paid within one year
Wages payable
Income taxes payable
Interest payable
Other accrued expenses payable
Deferred revenues and customer deposits",what
What is the days' sales in accounts receivable ratio?,"Definition of Days' Sales in Accounts Receivable
The days' sales in accounts receivable ratio (also known as the average collection period) tells you the number of days it took on average to collect the company's accounts receivable during the past year. 
Example of Calculating Days' Sales in Accounts Receivable
The days' sales in accounts receivable can be calculated as follows: the number of days in the year (use 360 or 365) divided by the accounts receivable turnover ratio during a past year. For example, if a company's accounts receivable turnover ratio for the past year was 10, the days' sales in accounts receivable was 36 days (360 days divided by the turnover ratio of 10).
Caution
The accounts receivable turnover ratio used above was calculated as follows:

The credit sales during the past year (cash sales are not included since they were not part of accounts receivable) divided by the next item...
The average accounts receivable balances during the past year

It is possible that within the average accounts receivable balances there are some receivables that are 120 days or more past due. These could easily be buried in the average if most customers are remitting the amounts by the dates the receivables are due. Therefore, it is best to review an aging of accounts receivable by customer to understand the detail behind the days' sales in accounts receivable ratio.",what
What is the quick ratio?,"Definition of Quick Ratio
The quick ratio is a financial ratio used to gauge a company's liquidity. The quick ratio is also known as the acid test ratio.
The quick ratio compares the total amount of cash and cash equivalents + marketable securities + accounts receivable to the amount of current liabilities.
Example of Quick Ratio
If a company's cash and cash equivalents + marketable securities + accounts receivable adds up to $1,000,000 and the amount of the company's current liabilities is $1,200,000, its quick ratio is 0.83 to 1 ($1,000,000/$1,200,000 = 0.83).
The quick ratio differs from the current ratio in that some current assets are excluded from the quick ratio. The most significant current asset that is excluded is inventory. The reason is that inventory might not be ""quick"" to turn to cash.",what
"If I want a gross margin of 25%, what percent should I mark up my product?","Definition of Gross Margin
Gross margin as a percentage is the gross profit divided by the selling price. For example, if a product sells for $100 and its cost of goods sold is $75, the gross profit is $25 and the gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of the selling price) is 25% ($25/$100).
Example of Calculating the Markup on Cost to Earn a Specified Gross Margin
Since you know the cost of a product and you know the gross margin percentage to be achieved, you can determine the selling price and the markup needed.
Let's begin by assuming that a company's product has a cost of $75 and the company desires a 25% gross margin (or 25% of the selling price). Let's use ""SP"" to indicate the product's required selling price and ""MU$"" to represent the gross profit, and state the gross margin as 0.25SP. This means that:

SP = Cost + MU$
SP = $75 + MU$
Since MU$ must be 25% of SP, we can state: SP = $75 + 0.25SP
Restating the previous point, we have: SP - 0.25SP = $75
Restating the previous point, we have: 0.75SP = $75
After dividing each side of the equation by 0.75, we have: SP = $100

With a selling price of $100 and a cost of $75, the  $25 markup as a percentage of the $75 cost is 33.33% ($25/$75). The gross profit of $25 ($100 - $75) also means a gross margin of 25% ($25 gross profit divided by the selling price of $100).",what
What will cause a change in net working capital?,"Definition of Net Working Capital
Net working capital,  which is also known as working capital, is defined as a company's current assets minus itscurrent liabilities.
Examples of Changes in Working Capital
If a company's owners invest additional cash in the company, the cash will increase the company's current assets with no increase in current liabilities. Therefore working capital will increase.
If a company obtains a long-term loan to replace a current liability, current liabilities will decrease but current assets do not change. Therefore working capital will increase.
If a company uses its cash to pay for a new vehicle or to expand one of its buildings, the company's current assets will decrease with no change to current liabilities. Therefore working capital will decrease.
If a company sells merchandise for $50,000 that was in inventory at a cost of $30,000, the company's current assets will increase by $20,000. If no other expenses are incurred, working capital will increase by $20,000.
If a company borrows $50,000 and agrees to repay the loan in 90 days, the company's working capital is unchanged. The reason is that the current asset Cash increased by $50,000 and the current liability Loans Payable increased by $50,000.
If a company collects $30,000 of its accounts receivable, there is no change in working capital since the current asset Cash increased, and another current asset Accounts Receivable decreased.",what
What is the accounts receivable turnover ratio?,"Definition of Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio
The accounts receivable turnover ratio is an important financial ratio that indicates a company's ability to collect its accounts receivable. Collecting accounts receivable is critical for a company to pay its obligations when they are due.
The calculation of the accounts receivable turnover ratio is: credit sales for a year divided by the company's average amount of accounts receivable throughout that year. Note that only the company's credit sales (or sales on credit) are used in the calculation, since cash sales do not involve accounts receivable.
Example of Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio
To illustrate the calculation of the accounts receivable turnover, let's assume that a company’s credit sales for the most recent year were $6,000,000 and its average amount of accounts receivable during that year were $600,000. As a result, the accounts receivable turnover ratio is: credit sales of $6,000,000 divided by the average amount of accounts receivable of $600,000 = 10 times a year. This indicates that on average the company’s accounts receivables turned over 10 times during the year, or approximately every 36 days (360 or 365 days per year divided by the turnover of 10).
Whether the accounts receivable turnover ratio of 10 is good or bad depends on the company's past ratios, the average for other companies in the same industry, and the specific credit terms given to the company's customers.
Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio is an Average
It is important to emphasize that the accounts receivable turnover ratio is an average, since an average can hide important details. For example, some past due receivables could be ""hidden"" or offset by receivables that have paid faster than the average. If you have access to the company's details, you should review a detailed aging of accounts receivable to detect slow paying customers.",what
What is the meaning of debtor?,"Definition of Debtor
A debtor is a person, company, or other entity that owes money. In other words, the debtor has a debt or legal obligation to pay the amount owed. 
Example of Debtor
If a company borrows $10,000 from a bank, the company is the debtor and the bank is the creditor.",what
What is working capital?,"Definition of Working Capital
Working capital is the amount of a company's current assets minus the amount of its current liabilities. 
Example of Working Capital
Let's assume that a company's balance sheet dated June 30 reports the following amounts:

Total amount of current assets is $323,000
Total amount of current liabilities is $310,000

Therefore, the company's working capital on June 30 was $13,000. If one year earlier the company had current assets of $210,000 and current liabilities of $60,000, its working capital was $150,000.
Additional Comments on Working Capital
The adequacy of a company's working capital depends on the industry in which it competes, its relationship with its customers and suppliers, and other factors such as the following:

The types of current assets and how quickly they can be converted to cash. For instance, marketable securities can be converted to cash much faster than inventory.
The nature of the company's sales and how customers pay. If a company has very consistent sales via the Internet and its customers pay with credit cards at the time they place the order, a small amount of working capital may be sufficient. However, another company in an industry where the credit terms are net 60 days will need a greater amount of working capital.
Having an approved credit line with no borrowing allows a company to operate comfortably with a small amount of working capital.

In short, there is more to working capital than simply subtracting current liabilities from current assets.",what
What is the current ratio?,"Definition of Current Ratio
The current ratio is a financial ratio that shows the proportion of a company's current assets to its current liabilities. The current ratio is often classified as a liquidity ratio and a larger current ratio is better than a smaller one. However, a company's liquidity is dependent on converting the current assets to cash in time to pay its obligations. 
Example of Current Ratio
If a company's current assets are $600,000 and its current liabilities are $200,000 the current ratio is 3:1. If the current assets are $600,000 and the current liabilities are $500,000 the current ratio is 1.2:1. Obviously a larger current ratio is better than a smaller ratio. Some people feel that a current ratio that is less than 1:1 indicates insolvency. However, some online sellers with customers paying with credit cards at the time of ordering may operate comfortably with a very low current ratio. 
It is wise to compare a company's current ratio to that of other companies in the same industry. You are also wise to compare a company's recent current ratio to its ratio at earlier dates. In other words, spotting a trend can be important.
Caution
The composition of the current assets is also an important consideration. If the current assets are predominantly in cash, marketable securities, and collectible accounts receivable, that is likely to provide more liquidity than a huge amount of slow moving inventory.",what
What are pro forma financial statements?,"Definition of Pro Forma Financial Statement
A pro forma financial statement is one based on certain assumptions and projections (as opposed to the typical financial statement based on actual past transactions).
Example of Pro Forma Financial Statement
A corporation may want to see the effects of three possible financing options. Therefore, it prepares a projected balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows for each of the three financing options. These projected financial statements are referred to as pro forma financial statements.",what
What is the difference between liability and debt?,"Definition of Liability
In accounting and bookkeeping, the term liability refers to a company's obligation arising from a past transaction.
Examples of Liabilities
A few of the more common types of liabilities include:

Accounts payable
Loans or notes payable
Accrued expenses payable
Deferred revenues
Bonds payable
Income taxes payable and deferred income taxes

Definition of Debt
When some people use the term debt, they are referring to all of the amounts that a company owes. In other words, they use the term debt to mean total liabilities.
Others use the term debt to mean only the formal, written loans and bonds payable.
Examples of Debt
As an example of debt meaning the total amount of a company's liabilities, we look to the debt-to-equity ratio. In the calculation of that financial ratio, debt  means the total amount of liabilities (not merely the amount of short-term and long-term loans and bonds payable).
Others use the word debt  to mean only the formal, written financing agreements such as short-term loans payable, long-term loans payable, and bonds payable.
This is a good reminder that people have different perspectives and understandings of accounting terms.",what
What is the days' sales in inventory ratio?,"Definition of Days' Sales in Inventory
The financial ratio days' sales in inventory tells you the number of days it took a company to sell its inventory during a recent year. Keep in mind that a company's inventory will change throughout the year, and its sales will fluctuate as well. Therefore, you should view this as an average from the past.
The calculation of the days' sales in inventory is: the number of days in a year (365 or 360 days) divided by the inventory turnover ratio.
Example of Days' Sales in Inventory
To illustrate the days' sales in inventory, let's assume that in the previous year a company had an inventory turnover ratio of 9. Using 360 as the number of days in the year, the company's days' sales in inventory was 40 days (360 days divided by 9). Since sales and inventory levels usually fluctuate during a year, the 40 days is an average from a previous time.
It is important to realize that a financial ratio will likely vary between industries. Hence, a company's ratios should be compared to its own past financial ratios and to the ratios of companies within its industry.",what
What is the difference between accounts payable and accrued expenses payable?,"Definition of Accounts Payable
Accounts Payable is a liability account in which suppliers' or vendors' approved invoices are recorded. As a result, the balance in Accounts Payable should be a precise amount.
Definition of Accrued Expenses Payable
Accrued Expenses Payable is a liability account that records amounts that are owed, but the vendors' invoices have not yet been received and/or have not yet been recorded in Accounts Payable as of the end of the accounting period. The amounts in this account are usually recorded with accrual adjusting entries made at the end of the accounting period.
Examples of Accrued Expenses Payable
In addition to the amounts associated with vendors' invoices, accrued expenses may also include wages, interest, utilities, and other expenses that were incurred and owed, but not yet recorded in the general ledger accounts. Some of the amounts recorded in Accrued Expenses Payable may be estimated amounts that should supported by reasonable and documented calculations.

What is the working capital turnover ratio?,"Definition of Working Capital Turnover Ratio
The working capital turnover ratio is also referred to as net sales to working capital. It indicates a company's effectiveness in using its working capital.
The working capital turnover ratio is calculated as follows: net annual sales divided by the average amount of working capital during the same year.
Example of Working Capital Turnover Ratio
To illustrate the working capital turnover ratio, let's assume that a company's net sales for the most recent year were $2,400,000 and its average amount of working capital during the year was $400,000. Therefore, its working capital turnover ratio was: net sales of $2,400,000 divided by average working capital of $400,000 = 6 times during the year.
As with most financial ratios, you should compare the working capital turnover ratio to other companies in the same industry and to the same company's past and planned working capital turnover ratios.",what
What is the difference between gross profit margin and gross margin?,"Definition of Gross Profit
Gross profit is an amount that is computed as follows:

A company's net Sales minus its cost of goods sold
A product's selling price minus the product's cost

Gross profit is the amount before deducting the following expenses: selling, general, administrative, interest, and income tax.
Definition of Gross Profit Margin
Gross profit margin is also referred to as the gross profit percentage or gross margin ratio. In that situation the calculation is:

A company's gross profit divided by the company's net sales
A product's gross profit margin divided by the product's selling price

Definition of Gross Margin
Some use the term gross margin to mean exactly the same as gross profit. Perhaps they want to avoid the word profit  since the selling, general, administrative, and interest expense have not yet been considered.
Others will use the term gross margin to mean the gross profit margin or gross profit percentage or gross margin ratio.
Example of Gross Profit, Gross Profit Margin and Gross Margin
Assume that in its most recent year a company had net sales of $80,000 and cost of goods sold of $60,000. As a result, the company had a gross profit of $20,000 ($80,000 minus $60,000) and a gross profit margin of 25% ($20,000 divided by $80,000). Some people will say the company had a gross margin of $20,000 while others will say the company had a gross margin of 25%. Others might say the company had a gross margin ratio of 25%.",what
What is a liquidity ratio?,"Definition of Liquidity Ratio
A liquidity ratio is a financial ratio that indicates whether a company's current assets will be sufficient to meet the company's obligations when they become due.
Examples of Liquidity Ratios
Typically, the following financial ratios are considered to be liquidity ratios:

Current ratio
Quick ratio or acid test ratio

The amount of a company's working capital is also cited as an indicator of liquidity.
However, a company with a large amount of inventory that is difficult to sell may have a large amount of working capital and a favorable current ratio, but may not have liquidity. Hence, the inventory turnover ratio and the accounts receivable turnover ratio can provide insights as to a company's ability to convert its current assets to cash in time to pay its obligations when they become due.",what
What is the operating cycle?,"Operating cycle definition
The operating cycle is the time required for a company's cash to be put into its operations and then return to the company's cash account.
Operating cycle example
A manufacturer's operating cycle is amount of time required for the manufacturer's cash to be used to:

pay for the raw materials needed in its products
pay for the labor and overhead costs needed to convert the raw materials into products
hold the finished products in inventory until they are sold
wait for the customers' cash payments to be collected

The operating cycle is the sum of the following:

the days' sales in inventory (365 days/inventory turnover ratio), plus
the average collection period (365 days/accounts receivable turnover ratio)

The operating cycle has importance in classifying current assets and current liabilities. While most manufacturers have operating cycles of several months, a few industries require very long processing times. This could result in an operating cycle that is longer than one year. To accommodate those industries, the accountants' definitions of current assets and current liabilities include the following phrase: ...within one year or within the operating cycle, whichever is longer.

What are accounting ratios?,"Definition of Accounting Ratios
Accounting ratios, which are also known as financial ratios, are one part of financial statement analysis. Accounting ratios will often relate one financial statement amount to another financial statement amount. For instance, the inventory turnover ratio divides a company's cost of goods sold for a recent year by the company's average inventory during that year.
Perhaps the most frequently used accounting ratio is the current ratio, which divides a company's current assets by its current liabilities.
A company's accounting ratios can be compared to the ratios of other companies in the same industry. An accounting ratio can also be compared to the company's same ratio in recent periods to see whether the company is improving or declining. 
Examples of Accounting Ratios
In addition to the inventory turnover ratio and the current ratio, here are some additional accounting/financial ratios:

Quick ratio
Debt to equity ratio
Accounts receivable turnover ratio
Days' sales in inventory
Interest coverage ratio

What is window dressing?,"Definition of Window Dressing
Window dressing refers to actions taken or not taken prior to issuing financial statements in order to improve the appearance of the financial statements.
Example of Window Dressing
Let's assume that a company operates throughout the year with a negative balance in its general ledger account Cash: Checking Account. (At the bank, the checking account has a positive balance due to the time it takes for the company's checks to clear.) In order to avoid its December 31 balance sheet reporting a negative cash balance, the company decides to postpone issuing checks for vendors' invoices that should have been paid. The postponement allows its general ledger Cash account to temporarily have a positive amount. On January 2, the company will issue the postponed checks and will resume its normal practice of having a negative balance in its Cash account.",what
What is the times interest earned ratio?,"Definition of Times Interest Earned Ratio
The times interest earned ratio is an indicator of a corporation's ability to meet the interest payments on its debt. The times interest earned ratio is calculated as follows: the corporation's income before interest expense and income tax expense divided by its interest expense.
The larger the times interest earned ratio, the more likely that the corporation can make its interest payments.
The times interest earned ratio is also referred to as the interest coverage ratio.
Example of Times Interest Earned Ratio
Assume that a corporation had the following amounts for the most recent year:

Net income after tax of $500,000
Interest expense of $200,000
Income tax expense of $300,000

Given these assumptions, the corporation's income before interest and income tax expense was $1,000,000 (net income of $500,000 + interest expense of $200,000 + income tax expense of $300,000). Since the interest expense was $200,000, the corporation's times interest earned ratio was 5 ($1,000,000 divided by $200,000).",what
What is the acid test ratio?,"Definition of Acid Test Ratio
The acid test ratio, which is also known as the quick ratio, compares the total of a company's cash, temporary marketable securities, and accounts receivable to the total amount of the company's current liabilities.
The acid test ratio is considered to be a better indicator of a company's ability to meet its current obligations than the current ratio because inventories and prepaid expenses are not included.
Example of Acid Test Ratio
Let's illustrate the acid test ratio by assuming that a company has cash of $7,000 + temporary marketable securities of $20,000 + accounts receivables of $93,000. This adds up to $120,000 of quick assets. If the company's current liabilities amount to $100,000 the acid test ratio is 1.2:1.
A large acid test ratio gives creditors confidence that the company will be able to meet its current obligations when they come due.",what
What are the typical items reported as current liabilities?,"Here are the typical items that are reported as current liabilities on a corporation's balance sheet:
1. Accounts payable. These are the amounts that are due to vendors who have supplied goods or services. The accounts payable are supported by the vendor invoices that have been approved and processed, but have not yet been paid.
2. Deferred revenues. This reports the amounts that a customer has prepaid and will be earned by the company within one year of the balance sheet date. An example is a retailer's unredeemed gift cards.
3. Accrued compensation. Included in this are payroll related items such as the amounts due to employees and the amounts to be remitted for payroll taxes.
4. Other accrued expenses or liabilities. This reports the amounts that the company owes for items not recorded in accounts payable or accrued compensation. Examples include the interest expense that the company has incurred (but has not yet paid) and repairs that took place but the vendor's invoice has not been fully processed.
5. Accrued income taxes and perhaps some deferred income taxes.
6. Short-term notes. These include the loans from banks that will become due within one year of the balance sheet date.
7. The current portion of long-term debt. The principal payments of a mortgage loan or an equipment loan that must be paid within one year of the date of the balance sheet are reported in this item.
To be reported as a current liability the item must be due within one year of the balance sheet date (unless the company's operating cycle is longer). However, there is no requirement that the current liabilities be presented in the order in which they will be paid. Hence, the current portion of long-term debt might be listed last, but the principal payment might be due within several days of the balance sheet date.",what
How does an expense affect the balance sheet?,"Definition of Expense
An expense is a cost that has been used up, expired, or is directly related to the earning of revenues.
Most of a company's expenses fall into the following categories:

cost of goods sold
sales, general and administrative expenses
interest expense

How an Expense Affects the Balance Sheet
An expense will decrease a corporation's retained earnings (which is part of stockholders' equity) or will decrease a sole proprietor's capital account (which is part of owner's equity).
In addition to affecting retained earnings or the owner's capital account, an expense will also cause one or more of the following changes to the balance sheet:

A decrease in Cash, Prepaid Expenses, Supplies on Hand, Inventory
An increase in the credit balance in the contra-asset account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts or Accumulated Depreciation
An increase in the balance in the liability account Accounts Payable, or an increase in Accrued Expenses Payable (including Wages Payable, Interest Payable, etc.)",what
What is the advantage of issuing bonds instead of stock?,"Definition of Bonds
Bonds payable are a form of long-term debt, which include a formal agreement to pay interest semiannually and the principal amount at maturity. The interest is an expense that reduces the corporation's earnings and its taxable income.
Definition of Stock
Shares of common stock are ownership interests in a corporation. There is no promise to pay dividends nor is there a maturity date. The dividends (if any are paid) do not reduce earnings nor do they reduce the corporation's taxable income. 
Advantages of Issuing Bonds Instead of Stock
There are several advantages of issuing bonds (or other debt) instead of issuing shares of common stock:

Interest on bonds and other debt is deductible on the corporation's income tax return while the dividends on common stock are not deductible on the income tax return. Hence, if a corporation's incremental federal and state income tax rate is 30%, bond interest payments of $40,000 will reduce the income tax payments by $12,000 (30% of the $40,000 reduction in taxable income). If the bond interest rate is 6%, the after-tax interest cost is 4.2% [6% minus 1.8% (30% of 6%)].
Since bonds are a form of debt, the existing stockholders' ownership interest in the corporation will not be diluted. Therefore, the future gains from use of the bond proceeds (minus the bond interest payments) will flow to the stockholders. This is related to the concept of leverage or trading on equity.",what
What is the inventory turnover ratio?,"Definition of Inventory Turnover Ratio
The inventory turnover ratio is an important financial ratio that indicates a company's past ability to sell its goods. Converting inventory into cash is critical for a company to pay its obligations when they are due.
How to Calculate the Inventory Turnover Ratio
The calculation for the inventory turnover ratio is: cost of goods sold for a year divided by average inventory during the same 12 months. 
A higher inventory turnover ratio is viewed as better than a lower ratio.
Note: The cost of goods sold is used (not sales) in calculating the inventory turnover ratio because the company's inventory is recorded and reported at its cost (not at its selling prices). However, be cautioned that some people will use sales and therefore will be overstating the inventory turnover ratio. It is also important to use the average amount of inventory throughout the entire year since using only the end-of-the-year amounts may result in a much lower average.
Example of Inventory Turnover Ratio
To illustrate the inventory turnover ratio, let’s assume that during the most recent year a company’s cost of goods sold was $3,600,000 and the average cost of its inventory account during the year was $400,000. As a result, the company’s inventory turnover ratio is: cost of goods sold of $3,600,000 divided by average inventory of $400,000 = 9 times during the recent year. This could be compared to the company's ratio in previous years and to other companies in the same industry.
Even with a favorable inventory turnover ratio, a company may have some excess and obsolete inventory items. Therefore, it is wise to compare the quantity of each item in inventory to the quantity of each item sold during the past year.",what
What is a customer deposit?,"Definition of Customer Deposit
A customer deposit could be money that a company receives from a customer prior to the company earning it (by providing the customer with goods or services). In other words, the company receives the asset Cash and has an obligation to provide the goods or services to the customer or to return the money. Hence, the current liability account Customer Deposits is credited. When the company earns the deposit amount, the current liability will be debited and Sales Revenues will be credited.
A customer deposit could also refer to the money a bank receives from a depositor. Since the bank is not earning this money, the amount is recorded by the bank with a debit to Cash and a credit to Customer Deposits.
Example of Customer Deposit
Let's assume that Ace Manufacturing Inc. agrees to produce an expensive, custom-made machine for one of its customers. Ace requires that the customer pay $50,000 before Ace begins to design and construct the machine. The $50,000 payment is made in December 2018 and the machine must be finished by March 31, 2019. The $50,000 is a down payment toward the machine's price of $400,000.
In December 2018 Ace will debit Cash for $50,000 and will credit Customer Deposits, a current liability account. When the machine is completed in 2019, Ace will debit Customer Deposits for $50,000 and will credit Sales Revenues for $50,000.",what
What is trading on equity?,"Definition of Trading on Equity
Trading on equity, which is also referred to as financial leverage, occurs when a corporation uses bonds, other debt, and preferred stock to increase its earnings on its common stock. 
Example of Trading on Equity
To illustrate trading on equity, let's assume that a corporation uses long term debt to purchase assets that are expected to earn more than the interest on the debt. The earnings in excess of the interest expense on the new debt will increase the earnings of the corporation's common stockholders. The increase in earnings indicates that the corporation was successful in trading on equity. If the newly purchased assets earn less than the interest expense on the new debt, the earnings of the common stockholders will decrease.
There is a limit to the proportion of debt that can be added before the corporation's financial future is jeopardized.",what
What is gross margin?,"Definition of Gross Margin
Gross margin is the amount remaining after a retailer or manufacturer subtracts its cost of goods sold from its net sales. In other words, gross margin is the retailer's or manufacturer's profit before subtracting its selling, general and administrative, and interest expenses.
Gross Margin Can be an Amount or an Expense
Gross margin could be expressed as:

An amount (also known as gross profit)
A percentage of net sales (also known as gross profit percentage or gross margin ratio)

The gross margin may be calculated for an individual product, a product line, or for the entire company.
Examples of Gross Margin Calculations
If a retailer had net sales of $40,000 and its cost of goods sold was $24,000, the retailer had a gross margin of $16,000 or 40% of net sales ($16,000/$40,000).
A manufacturer sells a product for $40 and its cost of goods sold (which consists of its manufacturing costs) is $28. Therefore, the product's gross margin is $12 ($40 minus $28), or 30% of the selling price ($12/$40).
Difference Between Gross Margin and Profit Margin
Gross margin is the amount or percent before subtracting the selling, general and administrative, and interest expenses. Profit margin is the amount or percent after the selling, general and administrative, and interest expenses are subtracted. For example, a chain of grocery stores many have a gross margin of 20%, but its profit margin may be 1% (of net sales).
What the Gross Margin Tells You
Analysts track a company's gross margin percentage to determine whether the company is able to increase selling prices when costs are increasing or when competitors are reducing prices or expanding their sales efforts. The gross margin of individual products could indicate to management that some products should be promoted more aggressively and some products should be phased out.",what
Is the installation labor for a new asset expensed or included in the cost of the asset?,"Accounting for Labor to Install Asset
The definition of an asset's cost is all costs that are necessary to get an asset in place and ready for use. Therefore, the cost of the installation labor (wages and related fringe benefits) is part of the cost of the asset (and not an immediate expense of the accounting period).
The total cost of the asset, including installation costs, will become an expense when the asset depreciated over the asset's useful life.",what
What is trend analysis?,"In the analysis of financial information, trend analysis is the presentation of amounts as a percentage of a base year.
If I want to see the trend of a company's revenues, net income, and number of clients during the years 2006 through 2012, trend analysis will present 2006 as the base year and the 2006 amounts will be restated to be 100. The amounts for the years 2007 through 2012 will be presented as the percentages of the 2006 amounts. In other words, each year's amounts will be divided by the 2006 amounts and the resulting percentage will be presented. For example, revenues for the years 2006 through 2012 might have been $31,691,000; $40,930,000; $50,704,00; $63,891,000; $79,341,000; $101,154,000; $120,200,000. These revenue amounts will be restated to be 100, 129, 160, 202, 250, 319, and 379. 
Let's assume that the net income amounts divided by the 2006 amount ended up as 100, 147, 206, 253, 343, 467, and 423. The number of clients when divided by the base year amount are 100, 122, 149, 184, 229, 277, and 317. 
From this trend analysis we can see that revenues in 2012 were 379% of the 2006 revenues, net income in 2012 was 467% of the 2006 net income, and the number of clients in 2012 was 317% of the number in 2006. Using the restated amounts from trend analysis makes it much easier to see how effective and efficient the company has been during the recent years.
Trend analysis can also include the monitoring of a company's financial ratios over a period of many years.",what
What is the difference between income and profit?,"Some people intend for the terms income and profit to have the same meaning. For example, the income statement was commonly referred to as the profit and loss (P&L) statement. When a company is profitable, we mean that the company has a positive net income.
To aid in understanding these terms, the word ""net"" is often added. Hence, we often see the terms net income and net profit. This communicates that the amounts are the remainder after expenses have been deducted. For example, a company's profit margin is often listed as the net profit margin (which is defined as the company's net income divided by its net sales). The word ""net"" also helps to distinguish a company's net profit from its gross profit, and its net profit margin from its gross profit margin.
Some people use the term income to mean revenues. For example, a bank or an individual will often refer to the interest they earn on bond investments as interest income or investment income. A retailer will refer to the sales of merchandise as revenues, but the revenues from secondary activities will be reported as other income or nonoperating income.
It is wise to keep in mind that different meanings are not unusual among people, businesses and countries.",what
What is liquidity?,"Definition of Liquidity
Liquidity is a company's ability to convert its assets to cash in order to pay its liabilities when they are due.
Current Assets
Generally, the assets that are expected to turn to cash within one year are reported on the balance sheet in the section with the heading current assets. Current assets are listed in the order in which they are expected to turn to cash. This is known as the order of liquidity. Since cash is the most liquid asset, it is listed first. After cash, the order is: temporary investments, accounts receivable, inventory, supplies, and prepaid expenses.
Evaluating Liquidity
Liquidity depends on 1) the speed at which the assets should be turning to cash, or 2) the assets' nearness to cash. For example, some temporary investments are marketable and can be converted to cash very quickly. Accounts receivable may be converted to cash in 10 to 40 days. However, inventory may require several months to be sold and the money collected. Hence, inventory is not considered to be a ""quick asset.""
To assist in evaluating a company's liquidity, the financial ratio known as the quick ratio or acid-test ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the company's quick assets (cash, temporary investments, and accounts receivable) by the amount of the company's current liabilities. [An alternate calculation of the quick ratio is to begin with the amount of the current assets and subtract the amount of inventory. The remainder is then divided by the amount of current liabilities.]
Some Inventory May Not Provide Liquidity
While the current ratio is also referred to as a liquidity ratio, a company with the majority of its current assets in inventory may or may not have the liquidity needed to pay its liabilities as they come due. Its liquidity depends on the speed in which the inventory can be converted to cash.",what
What are turnover ratios?,"Definition of Turnover Ratios
In accounting, turnover ratios are the financial ratios in which an annual income statement amount is divided by an average asset amount for the same year. Generally, the larger the turnover the better. 
The turnover ratios indicate the efficiency or effectiveness of a company's management. 
Examples of Turnover Ratios
Some of the turnover ratios are:

accounts receivable turnover ratio
inventory turnover ratio
total assets turnover ratio
fixed assets turnover ratio
working capital turnover ratio

What is the difference between the current ratio and the acid test ratio?,"The difference between the current ratio and the acid test ratio (or quick ratio) mainly involves the current assets inventory and prepaid expenses.
Definition of Current Ratio
The current ratio uses all of the current assets and divides their total by the total amount of current liabilities.
Definition of Acid Test Ratio
The acid test ratio uses only the following current assets (which are considered to be the ""quick assets"") and divides their total by the total amount of current liabilities:

Cash and cash equivalents
Short-term marketable securities
Accounts receivable (net of the allowance for uncollectible accounts)

Notice that inventory (which is a significant current asset for retailers and manufacturers) and prepaid expenses are not included in the list of quick assets and therefore are not included in the acid test ratio.
Example of Current Ratio and Acid Test Ratio
To illustrate the difference between the current ratio and the acid test ratio, let's assume that a company has the following:

Current liabilities $50,000
Cash and cash equivalents $5,000
Short-term marketable securities $10,000
Accounts receivable, net $25,000
Inventory $56,000
Prepaid expenses $4,000

The current ratio is 2 or 2:1 (total current assets of $100,000 divided by the total current liabilities of $50,000).
The acid test ratio is 0.8 or 0.8:1 (quick assets of $40,000 ($5,000 + $10,000 + $25,000) divided by the total current liabilities of $50,000.",what
What are the reasons for high inventory days?,"Definition of Inventory Days
I assume that inventory days is referring to the days' sales in inventory. If so, then inventory days is also related to the inventory turnover ratio. For instance, when the inventory turnover is low, the days' sales in inventory will be high. When the inventory turnover is high, the days' sales in inventory will be low.
Examples or Reasons for High Inventory Days
Assume that a company maintains a constant quantity of items in inventory. If economic or competitive factors cause a sudden and significant drop in sales, the inventory days or days' sales in inventory will increase.
Next, let's assume that a retailer increases its inventory quantities for some new products and for some special promotions of existing products. If the sales do not increase, the inventory days or days' sales in inventory will increase.",what
What is the debt to equity ratio?,"Definition of Debt to Equity Ratio
The debt to equity ratio or debt-equity ratio is the result of dividing a corporation's total liabilities by the total amount of stockholders' equity.
Expressed as a formula, the debt to equity ratio is: (Liabilities/Stockholders' Equity):1.
Generally, the higher the ratio of debt to equity, the greater is the risk for the corporation's creditors and prospective creditors.
Example of Debt to Equity Ratio
A corporation with $1,200,000 of liabilities and $2,000,000 of stockholders' equity will have a debt to equity ratio of 0.6:1. A corporation with total liabilities of $1,200,000 and stockholders' equity of $400,000 will have a debt to equity ratio of 3:1.",what
What is the accrual method?,"The accrual method of accounting reports revenues on the income statement when they are earned even if the customer will pay 30 days later. At the time that the revenues are earned the company will credit a revenue account and will debit the asset account Accounts Receivable. (When the customer pays 30 days after the revenues were earned, the company will debit Cash and will credit Accounts Receivable.)
The accrual method of accounting also requires that expenses and losses be reported on the income statement when they occur even if payment will take place 30 days later. For example, if a company has a $15,000 repair done on December 15 and the vendor allows for payment on January 15, the company will report a repair expense and a liability of $15,000 as of December 15. (On January 15 the company will credit Cash and will debit the liability account.)
The accrual method of accounting, which is also known as the accrual basis of accounting, is required for large companies. (The cash method of accounting may be used by individuals and some small companies.) The accrual method and the associated adjusting entries will result in a more complete and accurate reporting of a company's assets, liabilities, equity, and earnings during each accounting period.",what
What is the book value per share of stock?,"If a corporation does not have preferred stock outstanding, the book value per share of stock is a corporation's total amount of stockholders' equity divided by the number of common shares of stock outstanding on that date.
For example, if a corporation without preferred stock has stockholders' equity on December 31 of $12,421,000 and it has 1,000,000 shares of common stock outstanding on that date, its book value per share is $12.42.
Keep in mind that the book value per share will not be the same as the market value per share. One reason is that a corporation's stockholders' equity is simply the difference between the total amount of assets reported on the balance sheet and the total amount of liabilities reported. Noncurrent assets are generally reported at original cost less accumulated depreciation and some valuable assets such as trade names might not be listed on the balance sheet.",what
How can working capital be improved?,"Definition of Working Capital
Working capital is defined as the amount by which a company's current assets exceed its current liabilities.
How Working Capital Can be Improved
Some of the ways that working capital can be increased include:

Earning additional profits
Issuing common stock or preferred stock for cash
Borrowing money on a long-term basis
Replacing short-term debt with long-term debt
Selling long-term assets for cash

In addition to increasing working capital, a company can improve its working capital by making certain that its current assets are converted to cash in a timely manner. For example, if a company can better manage its inventory and its accounts receivable, the company's cash and liquidity will increase. This in turn improves the company's working capital. Similarly, if the company can negotiate more favorable credit terms with its suppliers, the company will have the benefit of having a larger cash balance (even though the amount of working capital will not change).",what
What is the accounts receivable collection period?,"The accounts receivable collection period is similar to the days sales outstanding or the days sales in accounts receivable.
To illustrate the accounts receivable collection period, let's assume a corporation had net credit sales of $360,000 during the past year and its accounts receivable balance was on average $40,000. The average credit sales per day were approximately $1,000 per day ($360,000 of annual credit sales divided by 360 or 365 days per year). The average accounts receivable balance of $40,000 divided by $1,000 of credit sales per day equals 40 days.
An alternative calculation is to use the accounts receivable turnover ratio. In our example, the accounts receivable ratio is 9 times per year ($360,000 of net credit sales divided by $40,000—the average accounts receivable balance). 360 days per year divided by the accounts receivable turnover of 9 equals 40 days.
Accounts Receivable Turnover Days Sales in Accounts Receivable
Balance Sheet: Retail/Wholesale - Corporation",what
How is working capital defined and measured?,"Working capital is the amount of current assets minus the amount of current liabilities as of specific date. These amounts are obtained from your company's balance sheet. For example, if your company's balance sheet reports current assets of $450,000 and current liabilities of $320,000 then your company's working capital is $130,000.
Even with a significant amount of working capital, a company can experience a cash shortage if its current assets are not turning to cash. For example, if a company has most of its current assets in the form of inventory, that inventory needs to be sold. Similarly, if a company has a large amount of receivables that are not being collected, the working capital amount isn't much consolation when you can't meet Friday's payroll.
There are several financial ratios that pertain to working capital. They include the current ratio, quick ratio, accounts receivable turnover ratio, days sales in accounts receivable, inventory turnover ratio, and days sales in inventory.
Monitor your current assets daily to keep the cash coming into your checking account. If you do the right things each day, your financial ratios have a better chance of being respectable at the end of the month.",what
What is the debt ratio?,"Definition of Debt Ratio
The debt ratio is also known as the debt to asset ratio or the total debt to total assets ratio. Hence, the formula for the debt ratio is: total liabilities divided by total assets.
The debt ratio indicates the percentage of the total asset amounts (as reported on the balance sheet) that is owed to creditors.
The larger the debt ratio the greater is the company's financial leverage. The appropriate debt ratio depends on the industry and factors that are unique to the company. 
Example of Debt Ratio
Assume that a corporation's balance sheet reports total liabilities of $60,000 and total assets of $100,000. The corporation's debt ratio is 0.60 or 60% ($60,000 divided by $100,000).",what
What is long-term debt?,"Definition of Long-term Debt
In accounting, long-term debt generally refers to a company's loans and other liabilities that will not become due within one year of the balance sheet date. (The amount that will be due within one year is reported on the balance sheet as a current liability.)
Example of Long-term Debt
Let's assume that a company has a mortgage loan with a principal balance of $200,000 with 120 monthly payments remaining. The loan payments due in the next 12 months include $12,000 of principal payments. The $200,000 of debt should be reported on the company's balance sheet as follows:

$188,000 as a long-term or noncurrent liability such as noncurrent portion of mortgage loan
$12,000 as a current liability such as current portion of mortgage loan

When the word ""debt"" is used to mean ""liabilities"" (as is done in financial ratios) then other examples will include vehicle loans, bonds payable, capital lease obligations, pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations, and deferred income taxes.
Some long-term debt that will be due within one year can continue to be reported as a noncurrent liability if the company intends to refinance the debt and can prove it will be done within 12 months without reducing its working capital.",what
What is the working capital ratio?,"Some use the term working capital ratio to mean working capital or net working capital. Working capital is defined as current assets minus current liabilities. When used in this manner, working capital ratio is not really a ratio. Rather, it is simply a dollar amount.
For example, if a company has $900,000 of current assets and has $400,000 of current liabilities, its working capital is $500,000. If a company has $900,000 of current assets and has $900,000 of current liabilities, it has no working capital.
Other people use the term working capital ratio to mean the current ratio, which is defined as the amount of current assets divided by the amount of current liabilities.",what
What is solvency?,"I use the term solvency to mean 1) that a company is able to pay its obligations when they come due and 2) that a company is able to continue in business.
Some people look to a company's working capital in deciding whether a company is solvent. They conclude that a company with a positive amount of working capital is solvent. In other words, a company that is solvent has more current assets than it has current liabilities. Stated another way a company that is solvent will have a current ratio that is greater than 1:1.
Others look at a company's total assets and total liabilities in deciding whether a company is solvent. They might conclude that if a company's total assets are greater than its total liabilities, the company is solvent.
I suspect that the definition of  solvency varies among people in the same country and from country to country. You should check the legal system in your country to find the appropriate meaning.",what
What is the difference between the current ratio and working capital?,"The current ratio is the proportion (or quotient or fraction) of the amount of current assets divided by the amount of current liabilities.
Working capital is not a ratio, proportion or quotient, but rather it is an amount. Working capital is the amount remaining after current liabilities are subtracted from current assets.
To illustrate the difference between the current ratio and working capital, let's assume that a company's balance sheet reports current assets of $60,000 and current liabilities of $40,000. The company's current ratio is 1.5 to 1 (or 1.5:1, or simply 1.5) resulting from dividing $60,000 by $40,000. The company's working capital is $20,000 which is the remainder after subtracting $40,000 from $60,000.

What is the difference between the current ratio and the quick ratio?,"The current ratio is the proportion (or quotient or fraction) of the amount of current assets divided by the amount of current liabilities.
The quick ratio (or the acid test ratio) is the proportion of 1) only the most liquid current assets to 2) the amount of current liabilities. In other words, the quick ratio assumes that only the following current assets will turn to cash quickly: cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Hence, the quick ratio does not include inventories, supplies, and prepaid expenses.
To illustrate the difference between the current ratio and the quick ratio, let's assume that a company's balance sheet reports current assets of $60,000 and current liabilities of $40,000. Its current assets include $35,000 of inventory and $1,000 of supplies and prepaid expenses. The company's current ratio is 1.5 to 1 [$60,000 divided by $40,000]. Its quick ratio is 0.6 to 1 [($60,000 minus $36,000) divided by $40,000].

What is separation of duties?,"The separation of duties is one of several steps to improve the internal control of an organization's assets. For example, the internal control of cash is improved if the money handling duties are separated from the record keeping duties. By separating these duties the likelihood of theft is reduced because it will now require two dishonest people working together to admit to each other that they are dishonest, plan the theft, and to then carry out the theft. One person will have to remove the cash and the other person will have to falsify the records.
Without the separation of duties, the theft of cash is easier. One dishonest person can steal the money and enter a fictitious amount into the records—thereby concealing the theft.
Another step in improving internal control over cash is to use a cash register, issue receipts, and have two people present when cash is handled.",what
What is leverage?,"In accounting and finance, leverage refers to the use of a significant amount of debt and/or credit to purchase an asset, operate a company, acquire another company, etc.
Generally the cost of borrowed money is much less than the cost of obtaining additional stockholders' equity. As a result, it is usually wise for a corporation to use some debt and leverage. Perhaps this is one of the reasons that leverage is also known as trading on equity.
Financial ratios such as debt to equity and debt to total assets are indicators of a corporation's use of leverage. In these ratios debt is the total amount of all liabilities (current and noncurrent). This means that a corporation's debt includes bonds payable, loans from banks, loans from others, accounts payable, and all other amounts owed.
In a related Q&A we illustrate how leverage can increase or decrease the returns on investments.",what
What is the difference between cash flow and free cash flow?,"Definition of Cash Flow
Cash flow refers to the amounts of cash that a company, investment or project generates. The cash that a company generates is different from the company's net income (which is measured using the company's revenues and expenses under the accrual basis of accounting).
A company's significant cash flows are reported in the statement of cash flows, which is organized as follows:

Cash flows from operating activities
Cash flows from investing activities
Cash flows from financing activities
Supplemental disclosures of significant noncash changes in the above sections

Definition of Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow is a metric often used by financial analysts. It is calculated by using two amounts reported on a company's statement of cash flows:

Total/Net amount of cash flows from operating activities, minus
Capital expenditures (which is a separate item reported under cash flows from investing activities)

Example of Free Cash Flow
Assume that during the most recent year a corporation had cash flows from operating activities of $300,000 and had capital expenditures of $225,000. The corporation's free cash flow was $75,000. 
Occasionally, dividends paid to stockholders during the recent year are also deducted in calculating free cash flow.",what
What is turnover?,"Turnover is used in some countries to mean sales.
Turnover is also used in certain financial ratios. For example, the inventory turnover ratio is calculated by dividing the cost of goods sold during a year by the average inventory during the same year. The accounts receivable turnover ratio is computed by dividing the credit sales during a year by the average balance in Accounts Receivable during the same year.",what
What is the profit margin (after tax) ratio?,"The after tax profit margin ratio tells you the profit per sales dollar after all expenses are deducted from sales. In other words, the after tax profit margin ratio shows you the percentage of net sales that remains after deducting the cost of goods sold and all other expenses including income tax expense. The calculation is: Net Income after Tax divided by Net Sales.
The before tax profit margin ratio expresses the corporation's income before income tax expense as a percentage of net sales.
The profit margin ratio is most useful when it is compared to 1) the same company's profit margin ratios from earlier accounting periods, 2) the same company's targeted or planned profit margin ratio for the current accounting period, and 3) the profit margin ratios of other companies in the same industry during the same accounting period.",what
What is the fixed asset turnover ratio?,"The fixed asset turnover ratio shows the relationship between the annual net sales and the net amount of fixed assets.
The net amount of fixed assets is the amount of property, plant and equipment reported on the balance sheet after deducting the accumulated depreciation. Ideally, you should use the average amount of net fixed assets during the year of the net sales.
A corporation having property, plant and equipment with an average gross amount of $10 million and an average accumulated depreciation of $4 million would have average net fixed assets of $6 million. If its net sales were $18 million, its fixed asset turnover would be 3 ($18 million of net sales divided by $6 million of average net fixed assets).",what
What is the interest coverage ratio?,"The interest coverage ratio is a financial ratio used to measure a company's ability to pay the interest on its debt. (The required principal payments are not included in the calculation.) The interest coverage ratio is also known as the times interest earned ratio.
The interest coverage ratio is computed by dividing 1) a corporation's annual income before interest and income tax expenses, by 2) its annual interest expense.
To illustrate the interest coverage ratio, let's assume that a corporation's most recent annual income statement reported net income after tax of $650,000; interest expense of $150,000; and income tax expense of $100,000. Given these assumptions, the corporation's annual income before interest and income tax expenses is $900,000 (net income of $650,000 + interest expense of $150,000 + income tax expense of $100,000). Since the interest expense was $150,000 the corporation's interest coverage ratio is 6 ($900,000 divided by $150,000 of annual interest expense).
A large interest coverage ratio indicates that a corporation will be able to pay the interest on its debt even if its earnings were to decrease. A small interest coverage ratio sends a caution signal.
Since the interest coverage ratio is based on the net income under the accrual method of accounting, we recommend that you also review the cash provided by operating activities (which is found on the corporation's statement of cash flows) for the same time period.",what
Why is inventory turnover important?,"Inventory turnover is important because a company often has a significant amount of money tied up in its inventory. If the items in inventory do not get sold, the company's money will not become available to pay its employees, suppliers, lenders, etc.
It is also possible that a company's inventory will become less in demand, perhaps become obsolete, or even deteriorate. If that occurs some of the company's money will be lost. Having slow-moving items in inventory also uses valuable space and makes the warehouse less efficient.
I assume that the risk of holding inventory was the reason for the quick ratio (also known as the acid-test ratio). In this financial ratio, inventory is excluded from the current assets that will be compared to the company's current liabilities.
While inventory is critical for meeting customers' needs, having too much of the wrong inventory items can result in financial problems.",what
Where do I record the refund of a registration fee?,"If the registration fee refers to a fee expense that you had originally paid but the amount is now being refunded to you, I would credit the same expense account that you had originally charged or debited, and would debit Cash.
If the registration fee refers to an amount you are refunding because someone had originally registered for one of your programs, I would 1) credit Cash for the amount you are paying out as the refund, and 2) debit a contra-revenue account such as Refunds of Registration Fee Revenues. This will allow you to easily track the total amounts of refunds that you make during a year. On the other hand, if it is rare for your organization to refund registration fees, you could simply 1) debit the amount you are refunding to the normal revenue account such as Registration Fee Revenues, and 2) credit Cash.",what
What is YOY?,"In financial analysis and data analytics, YOY is the acronym for year over year. YOY indicates the change from the comparable amount reported in the same period one year earlier. Below are three examples of YOY.
A retailer's sales for the first 5 weeks of the current fiscal year are $206,000, which is a 3% increase YOY. In other words, the sales in the first 5 weeks of this fiscal year are 3% greater than the sales in the first 5 weeks of the previous fiscal year. Based on this statement, the sales in the first 5 weeks of the previous fiscal year must have been $200,000. [$206,000 minus $200,000 is a $6,000 increase YOY. The $6,000 YOY increase divided by $200,000 is a 3% increase YOY.]
A church received contributions of $5,500 during Week #16 of its current year, which is a 10% increase YOY. In other words, the contributions during Week #16 of this year are 10% greater than those of Week #16 of the previous year (which must have been $5,000). [$5,500 minus $5,000 is a $500 increase YOY. The $500 increase divided by $5,000 is a 10% increase YOY.]
A website had 88,000 page views on the second Monday of January, which was a 12% decrease YOY. This means that the page views of the second Monday of January of the previous year were 100,000. [88,000 page views minus the previous year's 100,000 page views is a 12,000 decrease in page views YOY. The 12,000 decrease divided by 100,000 is a 12% decrease YOY.]",what
What are the limitations of the payback period?,"The payback period (which tells the number of years needed to recover the amount of cash that was initially invested) has two limitations or drawbacks:

The net incremental cash flows are usually not adjusted for the time value of money. This means that a net incremental cash inflow of $50,000 in the fourth year of an investment is deemed to have the same value or purchasing power as a $50,000 cash outflow that was part of the initial investment made four years earlier.
The incremental cash flows received after the payback period are ignored. Let's illustrate what this means by using two hypothetical projects which are being considered as an investment:

Project #187 has a payback period of 4 years. However, the amounts of the net incremental cash inflows are expected to decline beginning in Year 4 and are expected to end in Year 7.
Project #188 has a payback period of 6 years. However, the amounts of its net incremental cash inflows are positive and are expected to grow exponentially from Year 4 through Year 15.

While Project #187's payback period is faster, Project #188 is a significantly better investment. Hence, the limitation of using the payback period for ranking potential investments.",what
What are common-size financial statements?,"Common-size financial statements present the financial statement amounts as a percentage of a base number. For example, the common-size income statement will report the revenue and expense amounts as percentages of net sales. The common-size balance sheet will report each asset, liability, and owner equity amount as a percentage of total assets.
Common-size financial statements allow you to compare the financial statements of large companies with the financial statements of smaller companies, because you are comparing percentages instead of dollars. For example, a small retailer can compare her cost of goods sold (perhaps 78%) to a much larger retailer's cost of goods sold (perhaps 80%). Similarly, one company's inventory might be 33% (of total assets) while a competitor's might be 28%.
Common-size financial statements are related to a technique known as vertical analysis.",what
What is the return on assets ratio?,"The return on assets ratio, or return on total assets ratio, relates a company's after tax net income during a specific year, to the company's average total assets during the same year.
Let's assume that a company had $60,000 of net income after tax during a recent year. During the same 12 month period its total assets averaged $1,000,000. Its return on assets ratio for the year was 6% ($60,000 divided by $1,000,000).
You would compare this company's return on assets to other companies in the same industry.",what
What is the free cash flow ratio?,"The free cash flow ratio is an amount, rather than a ratio.
The free cash flow calculation often begins with the cash flow from operating activities shown on the statement of cash flows (SCF). Next the amount of capital expenditures, taken from the investing activities section of the SCF for the same period, is deducted to arrive at the amount of free cash flow.
There are variations of the above calculation. For example, the dividends to stockholders might be viewed as a requirement and will be deducted along with the capital expenditure amount.",what
What are net incremental cash flows?,"Net incremental cash flows are the combination of the cash inflows and the cash outflows occurring in the same time period, and between two alternatives. For example, a company could use the net incremental cash flows to decide whether to invest in new, more efficient equipment or to retain its existing equipment.
Net incremental cash flows are necessary for calculating an investment's:

net present value
internal rate of return
payback period

To illustrate net incremental cash flows let's assume that Your Corporation has the opportunity to purchase a product line from Divesting Company for a single cash payment of $800,000. Your Corporation expects that the product line will result in the following cash flows occurring in each year for 10 years:

additional cash receipts or cash inflows of $900,000 (from the collection of accounts receivable related to product sales)
additional cash payments or cash outflows of $750,000 (for payments related to the product line's costs and expenses)

These cash flows indicate that the net incremental cash flows are expected to be a positive $150,000 per year for 10 years, or that there will be net incremental cash inflows of $150,000 per year for 10 years.",what
What is ROI?,"ROI is the acronym for return on investment. Originally the objective of ROI was to relate a return (the income statement benefit) to the amount invested (such as the asset information from the balance sheet).
During the first half of the 20th century, ROI was helpful in monitoring the decentralized divisions of large diverse corporations. The ROI calculation may have divided a division's operating income by the average amount of operating assets being utilized by the division. For instance, a division with an operating income of $1 million that used $10 million of operating assets had an ROI of 10%.
A drawback of ROI is that the accounting amounts (revenues, expenses, asset book values, etc.) ignore the time value of money. As a result, companies began using discounted cash flows to better assess the profitability of its investments. Calculations such as net present value and internal rate of return became common and ROI was referred to as the accounting rate of return.
In the 21st century we see ROI used in the context of internet marketing and the adoption of wellness programs at large companies. In these examples the income statement benefits (more sales, lower health insurance expense) are related to the amounts being spent. Here, too, the ROI calculations do not consider the time value of money.",what
What is the effect on financial ratios when using LIFO instead of FIFO?,"During periods of significantly increasing costs, LIFO when compared to FIFO will cause lower inventory costs on the balance sheet and a higher cost of goods sold on the income statement.
This will mean that the profitability ratios will be smaller under LIFO than FIFO. The profitability ratios include profit margin, return on assets, and return on stockholders' equity.
The inventory turnover ratio will be higher when LIFO is used during periods of increasing costs. The reason is that the cost of goods sold will be higher and the inventory costs will be lower under LIFO than under FIFO.",what
How do you calculate the average balance in accounts receivable?,"The average will be more representative as you consider more daily balances in the computation. For example, if you compute the average balance for the year 2012 by using the balances from two days (December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012), you are ignoring the balances on the other 364 days of 2012. That's a problem if the majority of the company's activity occurs in the months of March through October. If that's the case, using only the December 31 balances will result in an average that is misleading.
To overcome the shortcoming of using the balance at the beginning of the year and the balance at the end of the year, some accountants use 13 balances: the balance at the beginning of the year plus the balances at the end of each month. For example, the 2012 average would be calculated using the ending balance on December 31, 2011 + the ending balance on January 31, 2012 + the ending balance on February 28, 2012 and so on. Obviously, this is better than using only the two December 31 balances. Of course you need to have access to the monthly balances.
Still better is to compute the average for the year by using the balances on each of the 365 days in the year—thereby considering fluctuations that occur within a month.
If you need a monthly average for accounts receivable, the logic is the same: 30 or 31 points of data is far better than merely using the beginning of the month balance and the end of the month balance.",what
What is the tax advantage when bonds are issued instead of stock?,"The tax advantage of issuing bonds (or other debt) instead of stock results from the interest paid by the company being a deductible expense on its federal and state income tax returns. Dividends paid to stockholders are not a deductible expense, since dividends are a distribution of profits to the owners of the corporation.
The size of the advantage depends on the income tax rate of the company paying the interest. For example, if a corporation issues $10,000,000 of bonds with an interest rate of 8%, its annual interest expense will be $800,000. When the $800,000 of interest expense is entered on the corporation's income tax return, its taxable income will decrease by $800,000. If the corporation's combined federal and state income tax rate on this increment is 40%, the corporation will avoid or save paying income taxes of $320,000 ($800,000 of less taxable income X 40%). If the corporation's income tax rate on this increment is 30%, the corporation will save paying income taxes of $240,000 ($800,000 X 30%).
Due to the income tax savings, the cost of the borrowed money is reduced. For a corporation in the 40% tax bracket, its net cost of the borrowed money is $480,000 ($800,000 of interest minus $320,000 of income tax savings) for a net rate of 4.8% ($480,000 of net expense divided by $10,000,000). For a corporation with a combined tax rate of 30%, the net cost of the borrowed money will be $560,000 or a net rate of 5.6% of $10,000,000.",what
What is the total asset turnover ratio?,"The total asset turnover ratio indicates the relationship of net sales for a specified year to the average amount of total assets during the same 12 months.
Let's assume that during a recent year a corporation had net sales of $2,100,000 and its total assets during the same 12 month period averaged $1,400,000. The company's total asset turnover for the year was 1.5 (net sales of $2,100,000 divided by $1,400,000 of average total assets).
This ratio will vary by industry, as some industries are more capital intensive than others. Always compare your company's financial ratios to the ratios of other companies in the same industry.",what
Which financial ratios are considered to be efficiency ratios?,"I consider the efficiency ratios to be the ratios also known as asset turnover ratios, activity ratios, or asset management ratios.
These efficiency ratios include 1) accounts receivable turnover ratio, and the related ratio days' credit sales in accounts receivable; 2) inventory turnover, and the related ratio days' cost of sales in inventory; 3) total asset turnover; and 4) fixed asset turnover.
The accounts receivable turnover ratio and the inventory turnover ratio are also used in the context of a firm's liquidity.
The total asset turnover and fixed asset turnover are indicators of a company's effectiveness in utilizing its assets.",what
What is the earnings per share (EPS) ratio?,"The earnings per share ratio, or simply earnings per share, or EPS, is a corporation's net income after tax that is available to its common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of shares of common stock that are outstanding during the period of the earnings.
Net income available for common stock is the corporation's net income after income taxes minus the required dividend for the corporation's preferred stock, if it has preferred stock outstanding.
Additional information on the calculations and presentation of a corporation's earnings per share are contained in the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings per Share. It can be read at no cost at www.FASB.org/st.",what
What is a voided check?,"A voided check is a check written or partially written but then canceled or deleted by the maker of the check.
The notation of ""void"" is used because checks are prenumbered for control purposes and every check needs to be accounted for.
Voided checks may require some adjustments when reconciling the bank statement. For example, if a check is written in December but is voided in January, the Cash account in the company's general ledger will need to be increased when the check is voided. (Another account will need to be credited because of double entry bookkeeping.)",what
Are liabilities always a bad thing?,"Liabilities are obligations and are usually defined as a claim on assets. However, liabilities and stockholders' equity are also the sources of assets. Generally, liabilities are considered to have a lower cost than stockholders' equity. On the other hand, too many liabilities result in additional risk.
Some liabilities have low interest rates and some have no interest associated with them. For example, some of a company's accounts payable may allow payment in 30 days. With those payables it is better to have the liability and to keep your cash in the bank until they become due.
In our personal lives, our first house was probably purchased with a down payment and mortgage loan. That mortgage loan was a big liability, but it allowed us to upgrade our living space. I viewed my mortgage loan liability as a good thing because it allowed me to own a nice home in a beautiful neighborhood.
So some liabilities are good—especially the ones that have a very low interest rate. Too many liabilities could cause financial hardships.",what
Why aren't retained earnings distributed as dividends to the stockholders?,"A corporation's earnings are usually retained instead of being distributed to the stockholders in the form of dividends because the corporation is in need of money to strengthen its financial position, to expand its operations, or to keep up with the inflation in its present size of operations.
The stockholders may prefer to forego dividends in order to see its stock value increase from the corporation's wise use of the retained earnings. This is especially true of  U.S. individuals in high federal and state  income tax brackets. These stockholders might end up paying 40% of the dividend amount in income taxes. They would rather have their stock appreciate in value with no tax payments and later sell their shares of stock at the lower capital gains tax rates.",what
What is the return on stockholders' equity (after tax) ratio?,"The return on stockholders' equity, or return on equity, is a corporation's net income after income taxes divided by average amount of stockholders' equity during the period of the net income.
To illustrate, let’s assume that a corporation's net income after tax was $100,000 for the most recent year. Let’s also assume that it did not have any preferred stock outstanding and that its stockholders’ equity was $950,000 at the beginning of the year and was $1,050,000 at the end of the year. The increase was at a uniform rate throughout the year. The return on stockholders’ equity will be 10% ($100,000 divided by the average stockholders’ equity of $1,000,000).
If a corporation has preferred stock outstanding, the relevant name is return on common equity and will be calculated as follows: net income after tax minus the required dividends on its preferred stock, divided by the average amount of common stockholders' equity during the period of the income.
As with most ratios, you should compare your corporation's return on equity with the ratio for other corporations in your industry.",what
What is Form 10-K?,"Form 10-K is a corporation's annual report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Form 10-K is required for U.S. corporations whose stock is publicly traded.
Form 10-K contains a wealth of information on the corporation in general such as its products, sales, markets, risks, officers, directors, and more. A significant portion of the Form 10-K is entitled Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. Another major section is Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. You will learn much about the corporation and about accounting by reading a corporation's entire Form 10-K. (In other words, don't skip the notes to the financial statements.)
A corporation's Form 10-K is usually available from each corporation's website (usually under Investor Relations). You can also access and download the SEC reports at no cost from http://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/webusers.htm.",what
What does the term organic growth mean?,"Organic growth often refers to the growth in a company's sales that did not occur because of an acquisition of another company. Expressed another way, organic growth is the internal growth or the growth from its existing businesses—not from the businesses it acquired during the period.
For example, a company's sales may have increased 25% during the past year. However, all of the sales increase was the result of having acquired a competitor. Therefore, it had no organic growth.",what
What is net working capital?,"Definition of Net Working Capital
Net working capital is the amount (as opposed to being a ratio) remaining after subtracting a company's total amount of current liabilities from its total amount of current assets. Hence, the formula is: net working capital = current assets minus current liabilities. (Net working capital is also known as working capital.)
Example of Net Working Capital
As an example, a company with current assets of $130,000 and current liabilities of $100,000 has $30,000 of net working capital. This amount may be sufficient for some companies but inadequate for other companies.
Difference Between Net Working Capital and Liquidity
Net working capital is often cited as one of the indicators of a company's liquidity. However, the amount of net working capital alone does not assure a company of the liquidity necessary to pay its current liabilities when they come due. For example, if a company's current assets consist mainly of slow-moving inventory and some slow-paying accounts receivable, the company may not be able to convert its current assets to a sufficient amount of cash in time to pay its obligations. Not having sufficient cash to pay employees, suppliers and other creditors may lead to serious problems.
In contrast, another company that sells fast-moving products online with customers paying with credit cards will have liquidity even with a small amount of net working capital. If this company's suppliers also have credit terms of net 60 days or the company pays its bills by using its business credit card, the company may be able to operate with negative working capital.
Managing Working Capital
In short, net working capital management is critical for a company's positive relationships with lenders, suppliers, employees and customers. All of the components of net working capital should be examined in detail and managed properly.",what
What is a limitation of the inventory turnover ratio?,"One limitation of the inventory turnover ratio is that it tells you the average number of times per year that a company's inventory has been sold. For example, if during the past year a company had sales of $7 million, cost of goods sold of $5 million, and its inventory cost averaged $1 million, the company's inventory turnover was on average 5 ($5 million of cost of goods sold divided by $1 million of inventory cost). A turnover ratio of 5 indicates that on average the inventory had turned over every 72 or 73 days (360 or 365 days per year divided by the turnover of 5).
However, the average turnover ratio of 5 might be hiding some important details. What if four items make up 40% of the company's sales and account for only 10% of the inventory cost? These fast selling items will have a turnover ratio of 20 (cost of goods sold of $2,000,000 divided by their average inventory cost of $100,000) meaning these items turn every 18 days (360 days divided by the turnover of 20). This means that the remaining items in inventory will have a cost of goods sold of $3,000,000 and their average inventory cost will be $900,000. As a result, the majority of the items in inventory will have an average turnover ratio of 3.3 ($3,000,000 divided by $900,000). In other words, the majority of items are turning on average every 109 days (360 days divided by the turnover ratio of 3.3). That's a significant difference from the 72 days that we first computed on the totals.
People within the company can overcome the shortcomings described above, since they have access to all of the sales and inventory detail. A computer generated report can compute the inventory turnover ratio and the days' sales in inventory for each and every item sold and/or held in inventory. By reviewing each item, the slow moving items will not be hidden behind an average.",what
Why not use Sales in the Inventory Turnover Ratio?,"The short answer is: Because Inventory is at cost. Inventory is not on the company's books at selling prices.
The Inventory Turnover Ratio is Cost of Goods Sold divided by average Inventory. Let's illustrate the ratio with the following amounts: Sales for the year $800,000; Cost of Goods Sold for the year $600,000; Inventory (average amount at cost during the year) $200,000. Inventory Turnover Ratio = $600,000 divided by $200,000 = 3 times. On average the inventory turned over approximately 3 times during the year.
Had we used Sales in the ratio, it would indicate that the inventory had turned over 4 times (Sales of $800,000 divided by $200,000 of Inventory), which is not the case. While some organizations do use Sales in the calculation, it is not logical to divide selling prices by cost. The resulting ratio is not reality. (Perhaps some use Sales because the Cost of Goods Sold number is not readily available for every company. In order to have comparability with all companies, they may have opted to use Sales.)",what
What does NOI stand for?,"NOI is the acronym for net operating income. Net operating income is also referred to as income from operations.
NOI excludes discontinued operations, extraordinary items, and nonoperating (or other) items such as interest expense, interest revenues, gains, and losses.",what
What causes a variation in profit margin and turnover ratios between industries?,"Mega grocery stores, discount stores, and warehouse clubs often have small profit margins but have high turnover ratios. The small profit margins as a percent of sales exist because of intense competition. The inventory turnover ratios are high because the stores feature the fast selling brands at low prices. Their strategy is that huge sales volumes with small profit margins will still result in adequate net income dollars.
In contrast to the stores with low profit margins and high turnover ratios, is a heavy equipment manufacturer with a high demand product that takes six months to manufacture. If this manufacturer has few or no competitors, a great product, and an excellent reputation for service, its profit margin can be very large. Unlike the discount stores, its inventory turnover will be very very low.
There can also be differences within the same industry. For example, one computer company might assemble and ship computers within hours of receiving the order via its website. Its inventory turnover will be off the charts, perhaps 90 times per year. If most of its customers pay with credit cards at the time the computer is shipped, the company will have very little in accounts receivable and will enjoy great cash flow. Another computer company might sell only through retailers. This company will have to assemble the computers in advance, store them, and then extend 60 days credit to the retailers. Obviously its turnover ratios will be less impressive than the ratios of the first company.
A company's management is another variable that explains differences in the profit margin and turnover ratios. Some managements are more focused, aggressive and disciplined in processing orders, controlling inventory. and improving processes. Companies with less proficient managers could end up having less impressive turnover ratios and profits.",what
What is the difference between liquidity and liquidation?,"Liquidity usually refers to a company's ability to pay its bills when they become due. Liquidity is often evaluated by comparing a company's current assets to its current liabilities. Working capital, the current ratio, and the quick ratio are referred to as liquidity ratios or short-term solvency ratios , since their calculations use some or all of the current assets and the current liabilities. Sometimes a company's accounts receivable turnover ratio, inventory turnover ratio, and free cash flow are also used to assess a company's liquidity.
Liquidation is a term commonly used when a company sells parts of its business for cash, or when it sells assets in order to pay debts. Liquidation may also involve the winding down or the closing of a business.",what
"When calculating inventory turnover, do you use sales or the cost of goods sold?","I calculate the inventory turnover by using the cost of goods sold. I use the cost of goods sold because inventory is in the general ledger at its cost and it is reported on the balance sheet at cost. Since inventory is the cost of goods on hand, it makes sense to relate it to the cost of goods sold.
Assume that during the past year a company's inventory had an average cost of $10,000. (This was the average of the amounts in the asset account Inventory and the average of the amounts reported on the balance sheet during the past year.) Also assume that during the year the company has sales of $60,000 and its cost of goods sold was $40,000. On average, the inventory turned over 4 times ($40,000 of cost of goods sold during the year divided by $10,000 the average cost of goods on hand during the year.)",what
Why are average balance sheet amounts used in calculating the turnover ratios?,"In the calculation of a turnover ratio, the numerator is an amount from an annual income statement, while the denominator is a balance sheet amount. Since a balance sheet amount is a snapshot and reflects only an instant or moment, there is an inconsistency between the numerator and the denominator.
For example, the numerator in the inventory turnover ratio is the cost of goods sold for the 365-day year, while the denominator reflects the cost of inventory for a just one moment at the end of the last day of the accounting year. To overcome this shortcoming, the denominator needs to be representative of all of the moments during the year.
When the inventory amount on last year's balance sheet and the amount on this year's balance sheet are the only amounts available, it is common to use the average of these two balance sheet amounts in the denominator.
Using the average of only two days can also be misleading if the company's year ends at the low point of business activity. For example, when a company's peak season is August through May, it is common to set the accounting year to be July1 through June 30. At June 30 its inventory will likely be at their lowest point of the whole year and will not be representative of the amounts during the months of August through May.",what
Where can I find financial ratios for my industry?,"One source for financial ratios by industry is the RMA Annual Statement Studies Financial Ratio Benchmarks. RMA is the acronym for Risk Management Association and formerly for Robert Morris Associates. Your banker and many larger libraries subscribe to this publication. It contains the financial ratios for 740 industries based on the financial statements of more than 265,000 small and mid-sized companies.
Another source for your industry's financial ratios is your industry's trade association, if it collects financial information from its members.
In addition to comparing your company's financial ratios to its industry, you will want to compare your company's financial ratios to its own past and future financial ratios. Spotting a trend early can be very beneficial.",what
What is credit analysis and financial analysis?,"Credit analysis is associated with the decision to grant credit to a customer. It is also part of a bank's lending procedures for making a loan and monitoring the borrower's creditworthiness.
I believe that financial analysis has a broader focus than credit analysis. Financial analysis would also include calculations such as return on equity, return on assets, price earnings ratios, dividend yield, comparisons with industry averages, trend analysis, and so on. Financial analysis would often be associated with investors, management, and creditors.",what
How do you calculate Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)?,"Return on capital employed is used as a measurement of the performance of a division of a company. It assumes that the division is not responsible for its financing and income taxes. (Financing and income taxes are the responsibility of the division's headquarters or executive's office.) With that in mind, ROCE is calculated as follows:
The division's Operating Income (before income taxes and before interest expense) divided by the Assets Employed at the division.
This calculation is very similar to return on investment (ROI) and could be broken down to be: [Sales divided by Assets Employed] times [Operating Income before taxes and interest divided by Sales] = Operating Income divided by Assets Employed = ROCE.

What is EBIT?,"EBIT is the acronym for earnings before interest and taxes. In other words, EBIT is a corporation's net income assuming it had no interest expense and no income tax expense. (Since the amount of earnings is based on the net income reported on the income statement, a corporation's other comprehensive income is not considered.)
A corporation's EBIT could be the same as its operating income. However, if the corporation has nonoperating revenues and/or gains and/or certain losses, the EBIT will differ from operating income.
EBIT is not a GAAP metric but EBIT may facilitate the comparison of companies' operating results for the following reasons:

Some corporations are Subchapter S Corporations which do not report corporation income tax expense
Some corporations are C Corporations which do report corporation income tax expense
Some corporations have significant debt and therefore report significant interest expense
Some corporations have little or no debt and therefore report little or no interest expense",what

What is the dividend payout ratio?,"The dividend payout ratio, or simply the payout ratio, is the percentage of a corporation's earnings that is paid out in the form of cash dividends.
The calculation of the dividend payout ratio is the cash dividends per share of common stock divided by the earnings per share of common stock.
A fast growing corporation often has a low dividend payout ratio in order to retain and reinvest its earnings in additional income producing assets.",what
What is the meaning of base year?,"In accounting, base year may refer to the year in which a U.S. business had adopted the LIFO cost flow assumption for valuing its inventory and its cost of goods sold. Under the dollar-value LIFO technique a company's current inventory is restated to base-year prices in order to determine whether the quantity of inventory has increased or decreased.
Base year is also the initial year in a series of annual amounts. For instance, an accountant might prepare a chart that displays the dollar amounts of a company's sales, gross profit, and net income for each of the years 2010 through 2012. In addition the accountant might add a price index for each line which expresses each line's amounts as a percentage of the 2010 amount. In this example the base year is 2010. Assuming that the sales for the years 2010 and 2011 and 2012 were $924,000 and $942,480 and $979,440, each of these would be divided by the $924,000 of sales in the base year 2010. The result would be the following index: 100 (for the base year 2010) and 102 (for 2011) and 106 (for 2012).",what
Where should a business report cash which is restricted to purchase a long-term asset?,"The cash which a business has restricted to purchase a long-term asset should be reported on the balance sheet under the asset heading Investments. Investments is the first of the long-term asset headings and it is positioned immediately after current assets.
The cash restricted for a long-term asset is not reported as part of the company's current assets because the cash is not available to pay current liabilities. Expressed another way, when the business restricts its cash for the purchase of a long-term asset, the business must reduce the amount it reports as working capital (which is current assets minus current liabilities).",what

Where can I find an illustration of a common size balance sheet?,"You will find an illustration of a common size balance sheet under AccountingCoach.com's Explanation of Financial Ratios. The common size balance sheet appears in Part 1b, and it is based on the balance sheet  presented in Part 1a.",what
What is the payout ratio?,"The payout ratio indicates the percentage of a corporation's earnings which are distributed as cash dividends to its stockholders.
Typically, the payout ratio is computed by using the per share common stock amounts. For example, if a corporation's cash dividend per share of common stock for the previous year was $0.72 and the common stock's earnings per share for that year were $1.20, the payout ratio was 60% ($0.72/$1.20).
Since dividends are formally declared by a corporation's board of directors, the corporation should have a policy regarding its payout ratio. The payout ratio policy should reflect the needs of the corporation as well as the interests of the stockholders. For instance, a startup corporation will likely have a payout ratio of 0%, since 1) the corporation will need to retain (reinvest) any profits in order to compete and grow, and 2) its stockholders want their investments to grow in value instead of receiving taxable dividends.
A large, established public utility with stable earnings and the ability to issue bonds payable (with low, tax-deductible interest payments) may strive for a payout ratio of 70%. This high payout ratio is wise for the utility, its customers, and its stockholders. This is likely to attract investors wanting a steady stream of cash dividends which increase with inflation.
To gain deeper insights for a specific corporation's payout ratio, we recommend reviewing the following components of its statement of cash flows:

cash from operating activities
cash dividends paid (part of the cash flows from financing activities)

For a U.S. corporation with stock that is publicly traded, it is wise to review the pertinent parts of its Form 10-K.",what
What is the 13 point average for inventory?,"The 13 point average for inventory for the calendar year 2012 would be the sum of the inventory amount at December 31, 2011 plus the 12 end-of-the-month amounts in 2012 divided by 13.
The reason for using these 13 dates is to develop an average for the year that considers every month's average inventory. This is much preferred over an annual average that is based on just two points: the amount of inventory at December 31, 2011 plus the inventory amount at December 31, 2012 divided by 2. By using 13 points throughout the year, seasonal variations will be included. Using only the end of year point for two years is generally not indicative of the inventory levels in the months throughout the year.
The 13 point average is also useful for determining other annual averages, such as accounts receivable, assets, and so on. With the use of computers, we can easily improve upon the 13 point average by using 365 points during the year.

What does per annum mean?,"Definition of Per Annum
Per annum means yearly or annually. It is a common phrase used to describe an interest rate. Often ""per annum"" is omitted, as in ""I have a 4% mortgage loan."" or ""This bond pays interest of 6%.""
Example of Per Annum
An example involves a supplier offering a credit customer an early-payment discount of 2% for paying an invoice in 10 days instead of paying the full amount in 30 days. In this example the supplier is giving up 2% of the invoice amount in order to be paid 20 days early.
To compute the rate per annum we restate the amounts by multiplying both the ""2%"" and the ""20 days"" by 18 (in order to get close to the 365 days in a year). The result is a per annum rate of approximately 36%.
Another example involves a business charging its customers 1.5% per month on any past due balance. The monthly rate of 1.5% can be converted to 18% per annum by multiplying the 1.5% times 12 months in a year.",what
What is the rule of 72?,"The rule of 72 is a simple formula that tells you the approximate amount of time or interest rate needed for an amount to double. The formula is Years X Rate per year = 72.
Here's how it works. If you invest an amount for 8 years at 9% annual interest it will double (because 8 years X 9% = 72). If you invest an amount for 9 years at 8% it will also double (since 9 years X 8% = 72). If your investment earns 6%, it will take 12 years for it to double (since 12 years X 6% = 72; or 72 divided by 6 = 12).
If you invest $1,000 at 12% compounded annually, it will grow to approximately $2,000 in 6 years (6 X 12 = 72; or 72/12 = 6). If the $2,000 continues to earn 12% each year, six years later the investment will be worth $4,000. If the investment continues to earn 12% per year, then in six more years it will have a value of $8,000.
If successful investors were able to earn 18% each year, the value of their portfolios would have doubled every four years (72 divided by 18 = 4). If the investors live a long life and continue to earn 18% compounded annually they will become very wealthy.",what
What is accounting?,"Definition of Accounting
Accounting is the recording of financial transactions along with storing, sorting, retrieving, summarizing, and presenting the results in various reports and analyses. Accounting is also a field of study and profession dedicated to carrying out those tasks.
Examples of Financial Accounting
One part of accounting focuses on presenting the financial information in the form of general-purpose financial statements (balance sheet, income statement, etc.) that are distributed to people outside of the company. These external reports must be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles often referred to as GAAP or US GAAP.
Examples of Management Accounting
Another part of accounting focuses on providing a company's management with the information needed to keep the business financially healthy. Although some of the information comes from recorded transactions, many of the analyses and reports include estimated and projected amounts based on various assumptions. Generally, this information is not distributed to people outside of the company's management. A few examples of this information are budgets, standards for controlling operations, and estimating selling prices when quoting prices for new work.
Other Examples of Accounting
Some of the many other examples of accounting include:

Advising on accounting systems
Income tax planning, advising, and reporting
Auditing the financial statements of companies and other organizations
Providing general business advice
Financial planning for individuals",what
How do you calculate the break-even point in terms of sales?,"Definition of Break-even Point in Sales Dollars
The break-even point in sales dollars can be calculated by dividing a company's total fixed expenses by the company's contribution margin ratio.
Definition of Contribution Margin Ratio
A company's total contribution margin in dollars is the total net sales minus the total amount of variable expenses. Dividing the contribution margin in dollars by the total amount of net sales is the contribution margin ratio. 
Example of Break-even Point in Sales Dollars
To illustrate the break-even point in sales dollars, let's assume that a company has fixed expenses of $100,000 per year. The variable expenses are estimated to be 80% of the net sales. This means that the contribution margin ratio is 20% of net sales.
Since only 20% of the sales dollars are available to cover the $100,000 fixed expenses, the company will need to have $500,000 of net sales ($100,000 divided by 20%). At $500,000 of net sales, the amount of variable expenses will be $400,000 (80% X $500,000). That leaves $100,000 to cover the $100,000 of fixed expenses. Hence, at $500,000 of net sales the company will be at the break-even point, which is the point where sales will be equal to all of the company's expenses. This is the point where the net income will be zero.",what
How do I calculate the after-tax cost of debt?,"Definition of After-Tax Cost of Debt
The after-tax cost of debt is the interest paid on the debt minus the income tax savings as the result of deducting the interest expense on the company's income tax return.
Example of After-Tax Cost of Debt
Let's assume that a regular U.S. corporation has:

A loan with an annual interest rate of 10%
An incremental tax rate of 30% (combination of federal and state)

If the corporation has a loan of $100,000 with an annual interest rate of 10%, the interest paid to the lender will be $10,000 per year. This interest expense will reduce the corporation's taxable income by $10,000 thereby saving the corporation $3,000 in income taxes (30% tax rate on $10,000 reduction in taxable income).
The after-tax cost of the debt is computed as follows: $10,000 paid to the lender minus $3,000 of income tax savings equals a net cost of $7,000 per year on the $100,000 loan. This means the after-tax cost is 7% ($7,000 divided by $100,000) per year.
Using the example above, the after-tax interest rate can also be calculated. The formula for the after-tax rate is: the loan interest rate of 10% minus (30% tax savings on the 10% interest rate) = 10% minus 3% = 7%.",what
What is cost accounting?,"Definition of Cost Accounting
Cost accounting is involved with the following:

Determining the costs of products, processes, projects, etc. in order to report the correct amounts on a company's financial statements, and
Assisting management in the planning and control of the organization
Preparing special analyses that assists in making the best decisions

Examples of Cost Accounting
A significant part of cost accounting involves the unit cost of a manufacturer's products in order to report the cost of inventory on its balance sheet and the cost of goods sold on its income statement. This is achieved with techniques such as the allocation of manufacturing overhead costs and through the use of process costing, operations costing, and job-order costing systems.
Cost accounting assists management to plan and control the business through budgeting for operations, capital budgeting for expanding operations, standard costing and the reporting of variances, transfer pricing, etc.
Special analyses includes cost behavior, cost-volume-profit relationships, make or buy decisions, selling prices for products, activity-based costing, and more.
Cost accounting had its roots in manufacturing businesses. However, today it extends to service businesses. For example, a bank will use cost accounting to determine the cost of processing a customer's check and/or a deposit, maintaining a checking account, processing international wire transfers, servicing a mortgage loan, etc. This in turn may provide management with guidance in the pricing of various services.",what
How do you calculate the cost of carrying inventory?,"Definition of Cost of Carrying Inventory
The cost of carrying inventory (or cost of holding inventory) is the sum of the following:

Cost of money tied up in inventory, such as the cost of capital or the opportunity cost of the money.
Cost of the physical space occupied by the inventory including rent, depreciation, utility costs, insurance, taxes, etc.
Cost of handling the items.
Cost of deterioration and obsolescence.

Often the costs are computed for a year and then expressed as a percentage of the cost of the inventory items. Others may focus on the incremental costs of carrying or holding inventory.
The cost of carrying inventory will vary from company to company. For instance, if a company has a large cash balance with no attractive investment options, has excess space for storage, and its products have a low probability for deterioration or obsolescence, the company's holding or carrying costs are very low. A company with enormous debt, little space, and products subject to deterioration will have very high holding costs.
Example of Calculating the Cost of Carrying Inventory
Based on the above items, let's assume that a company's holding costs add up to 20% per year. If the company's inventory has a cost of $300,000 the cost of carrying or holding the inventory is approximately $60,000 per year.",what
What is contribution margin?,"Definition of Contribution Margin
In accounting, contribution margin is defined as: revenues minus variable expenses. The contribution margin can be expressed as an amount and/or as a ratio or percent of revenues.
The contribution margin tells us how much of the revenues will be available (after the variable expenses are covered) for the fixed expenses and net income.
The contribution margin amount or ratio (ratio) can be presented for:

The company as a whole
A product line
An individual unit of a product

Example of Contribution Margin
Let's assume that a manufacturer has only one product and 80,000 units were manufactured and sold during a recent year. The selling price was $10 per unit. The variable expenses were $4 per unit (consisting of manufacturing costs of $3 per unit and variable SG&A expenses of $1 per unit). The company's fixed expenses were $390,000 (consisting of fixed manufacturing costs of $300,000 and fixed SG&A expenses of $90,000).
The amount of the company's contribution margin was $480,000 calculated using the following amounts:

Revenues of $800,000 (80,000 units X $10 per unit)
Variable expenses of $320,000 (80,000 X $4 per unit)

The contribution margin ratio for the company was 60% (contribution margin of $480,000 divided by revenues of $800,000).
The contribution per unit of the company's only product was $6 consisting of revenues of $10 minus the variable expenses of $4. The contribution margin ratio for the product was also 60% (contribution margin of $6 divided by the selling price of $10).
The contribution margin is a key component in computing a company's break-even point.",what
What is the difference between a cost center and a profit center?,"Definition of Cost Center
A cost center is a subunit of a company that is responsible only for its costs. A few examples of cost centers are:

Production departments within a factory
Service departments within a factory
Administrative departments such as IT and accounting
Definition of a Profit Center
A profit center is a subunit of a company that is responsible for revenues and costs. If a division of a company has responsibility for revenues, costs, and the resulting profits, it is a profit center.
Additional Comments
Cost centers and profit centers are usually associated with planning and control in a decentralized company.",what
What is budgeting?,"Definition of Budgeting
Budgeting is the process of preparing detailed projections of future amounts. Companies often engage in two types of budgeting:

Operational budgeting, and
Capital budgeting

Examples of Operational Budgeting
In a business, the budgeting for operations will include preparing the following projections for the next accounting year:

Amounts for sales
Amounts for producing goods
Amounts for each department's expenses
Summarizing the above budgets into a master budget or profit plan
Cash receipts and disbursements for a cash budget
Projected financial statements also referred to as pro-forma financial statements

Once prepared and approved, the budgeted amounts are used as a guide or road map in controlling the next year's business activities.
Example of Capital Budgeting
Capital budgeting involves future projects which overlap several or many future accounting periods. Capital budgeting usually means listing each project along with its cash outlays and expected cash inflows for each year. The amounts should be discounted to their present values and also ranked by priority and profitability.
Once prepared, the capital budget provides a guide for investing in future fixed assets as well as arranging for the financing of the projects.",what
What is the margin of safety?,"Definition of Margin of Safety
In break-even analysis, the term margin of safety indicates the amount of sales that are above the break-even point. In other words, the margin of safety indicates the amount by which a company's sales could decrease before the company will have no profit.
Example of Margin of Safety
Let's assume that a company currently sells 3,000 units of its only product. The company has estimated that its break-even point is 2,800 units. Therefore, the company's margin of safety is 200 units.",what
What is cost behavior?,"Definition of Cost Behavior
Cost behavior is an indicator of how a cost will change in total when there is a change in some activity. In cost accounting and managerial accounting, three types of cost behavior are usually discussed:

Variable costs. The total amount of a variable cost increases in proportion to the increase in an activity. The total amount of a variable cost will also decrease in proportion to the decrease in an activity.
Fixed costs. The total amount of a fixed cost will not change when an activity increases or decreases.
Mixed or semivariable costs. These costs are partially fixed and partially variable.

Understanding how costs behave is important for management's planning and controlling of its organization's costs, and for cost-volume-profit analyses (including the calculation of a company's break-even point).
Examples of Cost Behavior
An example of a variable cost is the cost of flour for a bakery that produces artisan breads. The greater the number of loaves produced, the greater the total cost of the flour used by the bakery.
An example of a fixed cost is the depreciation and insurance on the bakery facility and equipment. Regardless of the quantity of artisan breads produced in a month, the total amount of depreciation and insurance cost for the month will remain the same.
An example of a mixed cost or semivariable cost is the bakery's cost of natural gas. Some of the monthly gas bill is a flat fee charged by the utility and some of the gas bill is the cost of heating the building. These two components of the gas bill are fixed since they will not change when the bakery produces more or less loaves of its bread. However, a third component of the gas bill is the cost of operating the ovens. This component is a variable cost since it will increase when the ovens must operate for a longer time in order to produce additional loaves of bread.",what
What is responsibility accounting?,"Definition of Responsibility Accounting
Responsibility accounting involves the internal accounting and budgeting for each responsibility center within a company. The objective of responsibility accounting is to assist in the planning and control of a company's responsibility centers.

Typically each decentralized department and division within a company will receive a monthly report showing its budgeted and actual amounts for the most recent month as well as the year-to-date budgeted and actual amounts.",what
What is EOQ?,"Definition of EOQ
EOQ is the acronym for economic order quantity. The economic order quantity is the optimum quantity of an item to be purchased at one time in order to minimize the combined annual costs of ordering and carrying the item in inventory.
EOQ is also referred to as the optimum lot size.
The formula to calculate the economic order quantity (EOQ) is the square root of [(2 times the annual demand in units times the incremental cost to process an order) divided by (the incremental annual cost to carry one unit in inventory)].
Example of EOQ Calculation
Assume that a company has steady demand of 12,000 units per year for one of its products. The company purchases the product from its supplier at a cost of $100 each. The company's incremental cost to process an order is $144 and its incremental annual cost to carry the product in inventory is $16 per unit.
EOQ = the square root of [(2 X 12,000 units of annual demand X $144 the incremental cost to process an order) / $16 the incremental annual cost to carry one unit in inventory] = the square root of [(2 X 12,000 X $144) / $16] = the square root of [$3,456,000 / $16] = square root of 216,000 units = 465 units (rounded to a whole unit).",what
What are mixed costs?,"Definition of Mixed Costs
In accounting, the term mixed costs refers to costs and expenses that consist of two components:

A fixed component, the total of which does not change as the volume of activity changes
A variable component, the total of which changes in proportion to the change in the volume of activity

A mixed cost is also referred to as a semivariable cost.
A mixed cost is expressed by the algebraic formula y = a + bx, where:

y is the total cost
a is the fixed cost per period
b is the variable rate per unit of activity
x is the number of units of activity

To visualize the behavior of a mixed cost, it is helpful to graph at least 8 observations. Each observation's total cost (y) is aligned with the y-axis and is also aligned with the volume amounts indicated on the x-axis. To compute the best fitting line through the graphed data, you could use a mathematical tool known as simple linear regression analysis. This will calculate the fixed expenses (a) and the variable rate (b) based on the historical observations.
Example of Mixed Costs
The annual expense of operating an automobile is a mixed cost. Some of the expenses are fixed because they do not change in total as the number of annual miles change. These include insurance, parking fees, and some depreciation. Some of the expenses are variable since the total amount will increase when more miles are driven and will decrease when fewer miles are driven. The variable expenses include gas, oil, tires, and some depreciation.
Let's assume that a simple linear regression analysis indicates that the past annual expense of operating an automobile (y) consisted of the fixed cost (a) of $5,000 per year and the variable rate (b) was $0.20. When the number of miles driven during a year (x) are 15,000 miles, the expected total annual expense is the fixed expense $5,000 + the variable expense of $0.20 X 15,000 = $5,000 + $3,000 = $8,000. If the miles driven are 10,000 miles, the expected total annual expense is the fixed expense of $5,000 + the variable expense of $0.20 X 10,000 = $5,000 + $2,000 = $7,000.",what
What is variance analysis?,"Definition of Variance Analysis
In accounting, a variance is the difference between an actual amount and a budgeted, planned or past amount. Variance analysis is one step in the process of identifying and explaining the reasons for different outcomes.
Variance analysis is usually associated with a manufacturer's product costs. In this setting, variance analysis attempts to identify the causes of the differences between a manufacturer's 1) standard or planned costs of the inputs that should have occurred for the actual products manufactured, and 2) the actual costs of the inputs used for the actual products manufactured.
Example of Variance Analysis
Assume that a company manufactured 10,000 units of product (output). The company's standards indicate that it should have used $40,000 of materials (an input), but it actually used $48,000 of materials. The variance analysis may include the following:

There is an $8,000 unfavorable variance which needs to be analyzed
The $8,000 variance can be separated into a price variance and a quantity variance
The price variance identifies whether the actual cost per pound of the input was more or less than the planned or standard cost per pound
The quantity variance identifies whether the actual quantity of the input used was more or less than the planned or standard quantity for the actual output

The variance analysis of manufacturing overhead costs is more complicated than the variance analysis for materials. However, the variance analysis of manufacturing overhead costs is important since these costs have become a large percentage of manufacturing costs.",what
What is the high-low method?,"The high-low method is a simple technique for computing the variable cost rate and the total amount of fixed costs that are part of mixed costs. Mixed costs are costs that are partially variable and partially fixed. The cost of electricity used in a factory is likely to be a mixed cost since some of the electricity will vary with the number of machine hours, while some of the cost will not vary with machine hours. Perhaps this second part of the electricity cost is associated with circulating and chilling the air in the factory and from the public utility billing its large customers with a significant fixed monthly charge not directly tied to the kilowatt hours of electricity used.
The high-low method uses two sets of numbers: 1) the total dollars of the mixed costs occurring at the highest volume of activity, and 2) the total dollars of the mixed costs occurring at the lowest volume of activity. It is assumed that at both points of activity the total amount of fixed costs is the same. Therefore, the change in the total costs is assumed to be the variable cost rate times the change in the number of units of activity. Prior to using the high-low method, it is important to plot or graph all of the data available to be certain that the two sets of numbers being used are indeed representative.
To illustrate the high-low method, let's assume that a company had total costs of electricity of $18,000 in the month when its highest activity was 120,000 machine hours. (Be sure to match the dates of the machine hours to the electric meter reading dates.) During the month of its lowest activity there were 100,000 machine hours and the total cost of electricity was $16,000. This means that the total monthly cost of electricity changed by $2,000 when the number of machine hours changed by 20,000. This indicates that the variable cost rate was $0.10 per machine hour.
Continuing with this example, if the total electricity cost was $18,000 when there were 120,000 machine hours, the variable portion is assumed to have been $12,000 (120,000 machine hours times $0.10). Since the total electricity cost was $18,000 and the variable cost was calculated to be $12,000, the fixed cost of electricity for the month must have been the $6,000. If we use the lowest level of activity, the total cost of $16,000 would include $10,000 of variable cost (100,000 machine hours times $0.10) with the remainder of $6,000 being the fixed cost for the month.",what
What is the contribution margin ratio?,"Definition of Contribution Margin Ratio
The contribution margin ratio is the percentage of sales revenues, service revenues, or selling price remaining after subtracting all of the variable costs and variable expenses. 
Expressed another way, the contribution margin ratio is the percentage of revenues that is available to cover a company's fixed costs, fixed expenses, and profit.
Note that the contribution margin ratio is not the same as the gross margin ratio or gross profit percentage. Further, the contribution margin ratio cannot be computed from the amounts appearing on a company's external income statement.
Example of Contribution Margin Ratio
Assume that a company manufactures and sells a single product and has the following information:

Selling price per unit is $20
Fixed manufacturing costs per month is $18,000
Variable manufacturing costs per unit is $4
Fixed SG&A expenses per month is $12,000
Variable SG&A expenses per unit is $2
Fixed interest expense per month is $1,000

Using the above information the contribution margin per unit is $14 (the selling price of $20 minus the variable manufacturing costs of $4 and variable SG&A expenses of $2). Therefore, the contribution margin ratio is 70% (the contribution margin per unit of $14 divided by the selling price of $20). This contribution margin ratio tells us that 70% of the sales revenues (or 70% of the selling price) is available to cover the company's $31,000 of monthly fixed costs and fixed expenses ($18,000 + $12,000 + $1,000). Once the $31,000 has been covered, 70% of the revenues will flow to the company's net income.",what

Shares of common stock are ownership interests in a corporation. There is no promise to pay dividends nor is there a maturity date. The dividends (if any are paid) do not reduce earnings nor do they reduce the corporation's taxable income. 
Advantages of Issuing Bonds Instead of Stock
There are several advantages of issuing bonds (or other debt) instead of issuing shares of common stock:

Interest on bonds and other debt is deductible on the corporation's income tax return while the dividends on common stock are not deductible on the income tax return. Hence, if a corporation's incremental federal and state income tax rate is 30%, bond interest payments of $40,000 will reduce the income tax payments by $12,000 (30% of the $40,000 reduction in taxable income). If the bond interest rate is 6%, the after-tax interest cost is 4.2% [6% minus 1.8% (30% of 6%)].
Since bonds are a form of debt, the existing stockholders' ownership interest in the corporation will not be diluted. Therefore, the future gains from use of the bond proceeds (minus the bond interest payments) will flow to the stockholders. This is related to the concept of leverage or trading on equity.",what
What is an incremental cost?,"Definition of Incremental Cost
An incremental cost is the difference in total costs as the result of a change in some activity. Incremental costs are also referred to as the differential costs and they may be the relevant costs for certain short run decisions involving two alternatives.
Note: Incremental costs may include more than the change in variable costs.
Example of Incremental Cost
Let's assume that a company has the following experience:

Total cost of manufacturing 8,000 units of Product X is $320,000, or $40 per unit
Total cost of manufacturing 10,000 units of Product X is $360,000, or $36 per unit

From the above information, we see that the incremental cost of manufacturing the additional 2,000 units (10,000 vs. 8,000) is $40,000 ($360,000 vs. $320,000). Therefore, for these 2,000 additional units, the incremental manufacturing cost per unit of product will be an average of $20 ($40,000 divided by 2,000 units). The reason for the relatively small incremental cost per unit is due to the cost behavior of certain costs. For example, when the 2,000 additional units are manufactured most fixed costs will not change in total although a few fixed costs could increase.",what
"In accounting, what is meant by relevant costs?","Relevant costs are those costs that will make a difference in a decision. Relevant costs are future costs that will differ among alternatives.
We can demonstrate relevant costs with the following situation. A company is deciding whether or not to eliminate a product line. The product line accounts for approximately 4% of the company's activities. If the product line is eliminated, the officers of the corporation will continue to receive the same salaries and the central office expenses will not change. The product line managers and other employees working directly on the product line will be terminated. Hence, their salaries will be eliminated.
The salaries of the product line managers and other employees whose salaries will be eliminated are relevant to the decision. If these salaries are $700,000 with the product line and $0 without the product line, the $700,000 of savings is relevant. Those cost savings and other possible cost savings will be considered along with the loss of sales revenues.
On the other hand, the officers' salaries are not relevant in the decision. In other words, it doesn't matter if the officers' salaries are $500,000 or $5,000,000. The officers' salaries will be the same with or without the product line. Similarly, the decision maker does not need to know the amount of its central office expenses, since they will be the same with or without the product line. Expenses from previous years are also irrelevant.
To recap, relevant costs are the future costs that will differ among alternatives. You might use the past costs to help you predict those future costs, but the past costs are otherwise irrelevant to the decision. Accountants refer to the past costs as sunk costs.",what
What is trading on equity?,"Definition of Trading on Equity
Trading on equity, which is also referred to as financial leverage, occurs when a corporation uses bonds, other debt, and preferred stock to increase its earnings on its common stock. 
Example of Trading on Equity
To illustrate trading on equity, let's assume that a corporation uses long term debt to purchase assets that are expected to earn more than the interest on the debt. The earnings in excess of the interest expense on the new debt will increase the earnings of the corporation's common stockholders. The increase in earnings indicates that the corporation was successful in trading on equity. If the newly purchased assets earn less than the interest expense on the new debt, the earnings of the common stockholders will decrease.
There is a limit to the proportion of debt that can be added before the corporation's financial future is jeopardized.",what
What is a static budget?,"Definition of Static Budget
A static budget is a budget in which the amounts will not change even with significant changes in volume.
In contrast to a static budget, a company's sales department might have a flexible budget. In the flexible budget, the sales commissions expense budget would be stated as a percentage of sales.
Example of a Static Budget
Assume that a company's annual budget is a static budget. In this static budget is a line ""sales commissions expense budget $200,000."" This means that the budget for sales commissions expense will be $200,000 whether the actual sales for the year are $2 million, $4 million or $8 million. 
[In contrast, a  flexible budget  for sales commissions expense might be expressed as 5% of sales. This means that the budget for sales commissions expense will flex with sales volume. When sales are actually $2 million, the flexible budget for sales commissions will be $100,000. When sales are actually $4 million, the flexible budget for sales commissions will be $200,000. When sales are actually $8 million, the flexible budget for sales commissions will be $400,000.]",what
What is elastic demand?,"Definition of Elastic Demand
Elastic demand is the situation in which demand for a product or service is sensitive to price changes. 
Elastic demand is a major concern for a manufacturer that attempts to set a product's price based on the product's costs. For instance, if the manufacturer's production and sales have declined and it fails to cut fixed costs, the manufacturer could be worse off by increasing selling prices. It could even lead to a death spiral.
Examples of Elastic Demand
If the selling price of a product is increased, the number of units sold will decrease. If the selling price of a product is decreased, the number of units sold will increase. Elastic demand is also referred to as the price elasticity of demand.
[Inelastic demand means that the demand for a product is not sensitive to price changes.]",what
How do you calculate opportunity costs?,"First, you will not find opportunity costs in the general ledger. The reason is that opportunity costs are the profits associated with a missed or lost opportunity. For example, if a company has a limited number of machine hours available on its large specialized machine and the setup time is four hours, the company is losing the opportunity of producing profits during those four hours.
Opportunity costs are often thought of as the lost contribution margin, which is revenues minus variable costs. If the large specialized machine is billed out to customers at $200 per hour and the variable costs of operating the machine are $80 per hour, the contribution margin and the opportunity cost is $120 per machine hour. During the four-hour setup time, the company is losing or foregoing the contribution margin of $480. In other words, its opportunity cost for the setup time is $480.
While this opportunity cost of $480 per setup cannot be recorded in the general ledger accounts, it should be considered in quoting or setting prices for customers. It should also motivate the company to look for ways to reduce the time needed to set up the machine.",what
What is a fixed expense?,"Definition of Fixed Expense
A fixed expense is an expense whose total amount does not change when there is an increase in an activity such as sales or production. The words within a relevant or reasonable range of activity are normally added to the definition because at an extremely high volume or low volume, a change will likely occur.
Examples of Fixed Expenses
Let's assume that a retailer's monthly rent is $2,000. If the rent will remain at $2,000 whether the monthly sales are $15,000 or $30,000, we will say that the rent is a fixed expense. (Of course, if sales triple or drop to be 20% of the normal amount, the rent will likely have to change. Nonetheless, the present rent of $2,000 is considered to be a fixed expense since the extreme conditions are outside of the relevant range for short-term analyses.)
Other examples of expenses that are likely to be fixed within a reasonable range of retail sales include:

The store manager's annual salary
The depreciation expense for the buildings, fixtures, and equipment
The fixed contracts for security, maintenance fees, phones, internet service, insurance, lighting, advertising, etc.

Knowing the amount of a company's fixed expenses assists in understanding how the retailer's net income will change as volume changes. The total amount of fixed expenses can also be used to quickly estimate a company's break-even point.",what
What is sales mix?,"Definition of Sales Mix
Sales mix is the relative proportion or ratio of a business's products that are sold. Sales mix is important because a company's products usually have different degrees of profitability. Sales mix also applies to service businesses since the services provided will likely have different levels of profitability.
Example of Sales Mix
Let's assume that an automobile company plans to sell 100,000 units in the current year. The planned sales mix is 20,000 units of very-low-profit models + 50,000 units of medium-profit models + 30,000 units of very-high-profit models. In other words, the planned sales mix is 20%, 50%, 30%. With this volume and sales mix the company is planning to have a small operating loss.
Now let's assume that the total units actually sold were only 95,000 units. Having 5,000 fewer units sold could mean a huge operating loss. However, the company's loss (or profit) depends on the actual sales mix. What if the actual sales indicates that 15% of 95,000 units sold were the very-low-profit units, 45% of the sales were the medium-profit units were sold, and 40% of the sales were the very-high-profit units. In other words, this more favorable sales mix (15-45-40 instead of 20-50-30) could result in an operating profit (instead of the planned loss) even with 5,000 fewer units sold.",what
What is a rolling budget?,"A rolling budget is also known as a continuous budget, a perpetual budget, or a rolling horizon budget. We will use the following example to explain the meaning of a rolling budget.
Let's assume that a company's accounting year ends on each December 31. Prior to the start of the year 2013, the company prepares its annual budget which is detailed by month for January through December 2013. This budget could become a rolling budget if after January 2013 the company drops the budget for January 2013 and adds the budget for January 2014. This rolling budget now covers the one year, or 12-month, period of February 1, 2013 through January 31, 2014. At the end of February 2013, the rolling budget will drop February 2013 and will add February 2014. At this point the rolling budget will cover the one year period of March 1, 2013 through February 29, 2014.
The benefit of a rolling budget is that the company's management will always have a budget that looks forward for one full year.
A rolling budget could use 3-month periods or quarters instead of months. Also, a company might have a 5-year rolling budget for capital expenditures. In this case a full year will be added to replace the year that has just ended. This 5-year rolling budget means that management will always have a 5-year planning horizon.",what
Why does the fixed cost per unit change?,"Fixed costs such as rent or a supervisor's salary will not change in total within a reasonable range of volume or activity. For example, the rent might be $2,500 per month and the supervisor's salary might be $3,500 per month. This total fixed cost of $6,000 per month will be the same whether the volume is 3,000 units or 4,000 units.
On the other hand, the fixed cost per unit will change as the level of volume or activity changes. Using the amounts above, the fixed cost per unit is $2 when the volume is 3,000 units ($6,000 divided by 3,000 units). When the volume is 4,000 units, the fixed cost per unit is $1.50 ($6,000 divided by 4,000 units).",what
What is the coefficient of correlation?,"Definition of Coefficient of Correlation
In simple linear regression analysis, the coefficient of correlation (or correlation coefficient) is a statistic which indicates an association between the independent variable and the dependent variable. The coefficient of correlation is represented by ""r"" and it has a range of -1.00 to +1.00. 
When the coefficient of correlation is a positive amount, such as +0.80, it means the dependent variable is increasing when the independent variable is increasing. It also means that the dependent variable is decreasing when the independent variable is decreasing. However, a high positive correlation does not guarantee there is a cause and effect relationship. (A negative amount indicates an inverse association...the dependent variable is decreasing when the independent variable is increasing and vice versa.)
A coefficient of correlation of +0.8 or -0.8 indicates a strong correlation between the independent variable and the dependent variable. An r of +0.20 or -0.20 indicates a weak correlation between the variables. When the coefficient of correlation is 0.00 there is no correlation.
Relationship of Coefficient of Correlation to Coefficient of Determination
When the coefficient of correlation is squared, it becomes the coefficient of determination. This means that a coefficient of correlation of +0.80 will result in a coefficient of determination of 0.64 or 64%. (The coefficient of determination of 0.64 tells you that 64% of the change in the total of the dependent variable is associated with the change in the independent variable.) An r of +0.20 or -0.20 will result in an r-squared of only 4% (0.20 x 0.20), which means that only 4% of the change in the dependent variable is explained by the change in the independent variable.",what
What is a variable cost?,"A variable cost is a constant amount per unit produced or used. Therefore, the total amount of the variable cost will change proportionately with volume or activity. Generally, a product's direct materials are a variable cost.
To illustrate, let's assume that a bakery uses one pound of flour at a cost of $0.70 per pound for every loaf of bread it produces. If no bread is produced the total cost of flour is $0. If one loaf is produced the total cost of flour is $0.70. When 10 loaves are produced the total cost of flour is $7.00. At the volume of 30 loaves the cost of flour is $21 (30 loaves X 1 pound X $0.70 per pound).
An expense can also be a variable cost. For instance, if a company pays a 5% sales commission on every sale, the company's sales commission expense will be a variable cost. When the company has no sales the total sales commission expense is $0. When sales are $100,000 the sales commission expense will be $5,000. Sales of $200,000 will mean total sales commission expense of $10,000. Sales of $400,000 will result in total sales commission expense of $20,000.",what
What are the methods for separating mixed costs into fixed and variable?,"I know of three methods for separating mixed costs into their fixed and variable cost components:

Prepare a scattergraph by plotting points onto a graph.
High-low method.
Regression analysis.

It is wise to prepare the scattergraph even if you use the high-low method or regression analysis. The benefit of the scattergraph is that it allows you to see if some of the plotted points are simply out of line. These points are referred to as outliers and will need to be reviewed and possibly adjusted or eliminated. In other words, you don't want incorrect data to distort your calculations under any of the three methods.
Let's assume that a company uses only one type of equipment and it wants to know how much of the monthly electricity bill is a constant amount and how much the electricity bill will increase when its equipment runs for an additional hour. The scattergraph's vertical or y-axis will indicate the dollars of total monthly electricity cost. Its horizontal or x-axis will indicate the number of equipment hours. For each monthly electricity bill, a point will be entered on the graph at the intersection of the dollar amount of the total electricity bill and the equipment hours occurring between the meter reading dates shown on the electricity bill. If you plot this information for the most recent 12 months, you may see some type of pattern, such as a line that rises as the number of equipment hours increase.
If you draw a line through the plotted points and extend the line through the y-axis, the amount where the line crosses the y-axis is the approximate amount of fixed costs for each month. The slope of the line indicates the variable cost per equipment hour. The slope or variable rate is the increase in the total monthly electricity cost divided by the change in the total number of equipment hours.
The high-low calculation is similar but it uses only two of the plotted points: the highest point and the lowest point.
Regression analysis uses all of the monthly electricity bill amounts along with their related number of equipment hours in order to calculate the monthly fixed cost of electricity and the variable rate for each equipment hour. Software can be used for regression analysis and it will also provide statistical insights.
If  a scattergraph of data shows no clear pattern, you should not place much confidence in the calculated amount of  the fixed cost and variable rate regardless of the method used.",what
What is the meaning of a favorable budget variance?,"A favorable budget variance indicates that an actual result is better for the company (or other organization) than the amount that was budgeted.
Here are three examples of favorable budget variances:

Actual revenues are more than the budgeted or planned revenues.
Actual expenses are less than the budget or plan.
 Actual manufacturing costs are less than the amount budgeted for the period.

Occasionally, a favorable budget variance for revenues will be analyzed to determine whether it was the result of higher than planned selling prices, greater quantities, or a more favorable mix of items sold.
Similarly, a favorable budget variance for expenses will be analyzed to identify the cause of the lower expenses.",what
What is meant by the term relevance in accounting?,"In accounting, the term relevance means it will make a difference to a decision maker.
For example, in the decision to replace equipment that has been used for the past six years, the original cost of the equipment does not have relevance. In other words, the original cost is irrelevant or is not relevant in the decision to replace the equipment. What will have relevance are the future amounts, such as the cost of the new equipment, and the savings that will occur when the old equipment is replaced.
Here's another expression of relevance: Costs that will differ among alternatives. Costs that will not differ among alternatives do not have relevance.
In order to have relevance, accounting information must be timely. Financial statements issued three weeks after the accounting period ends will have more relevance than financial statements issued several months after the period ends. Having timeliness and relevance may mean sacrificing some precision or reliability.
Read more about relevance in paragraphs 46-57 of the Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No. 2, Qualitative Characteristics of Accounting Information, issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. You may read it at no cost at www.FASB.org.",what
How do you reduce the break-even point?,"Ways to reduce a company's break-even point include 1) reducing the amount of fixed costs, 2) reducing the variable costs per unit—thereby increasing the unit's contribution margin, 3) improving the sales mix by selling a greater proportion of the products having larger contribution margins, and 4) increasing selling prices so long as the number of units sold will not decline significantly.",what
Is contribution margin the same as operating income?,"Contribution margin is different from operating income.
Contribution margin is revenues minus the variable costs and expenses. For example, a retailer's contribution margin is sales minus the cost of goods sold and the variable selling expenses and the variable administrative expenses and any variable nonoperating expenses. (Perhaps some interest expense varies with sales.)
A retailer's operating income is sales minus the cost of goods sold and all selling and administrative expenses (fixed and variable). Operating income is the net income before the nonoperating items such as interest revenue, interest expense, gain or loss on the sale of plant assets, etc.
Contribution margin is used to determine the Break-even Point.",what
What is decentralization?,"Decentralization refers to a company's top management delegating authority to subunits of the company. Subunits include divisions, subsidiaries, profit centers, investment centers, and so on.
The extent of decentralization varies. For example, a profit center is likely to have authority to make decisions involving revenues and expenses, but will not have authority to make investment decisions or enter into banking relationships.
A benefit of decentralization is having the decision makers closer to the markets in order to make better and faster decisions. Another benefit of decentralization is having more individuals share the work involved in decision making. This in turn provides excellent training and development of future leaders of the company.
A disadvantage of decentralization occurs if a subunit makes a decision that is good for the subunit's financial results, but it means less than optimal results for the company as a whole.",what
What is a fixed cost?,"A fixed cost is one that does not change in total within a reasonable range of activity. For example, the rent for a production facility is a fixed cost if the rent will not change when there are reasonable changes in the amount of output or input. (Of course, if there is a need to double the output the rent will change when the company occupies additional work space.)
While a fixed cost remains constant in total, the fixed cost per unit of output or input will change inversely with the change in the quantity of output or input. For instance, if the rent of the production facility is fixed at $120,000 per year and there are 30,000 machine hours of good output during the year, the rent will be $4 ($120,000/30,000) per machine hour. If there are 40,000 machine hours during the year, the rent will be $3 ($120,000/40,000) per machine hour.
Many manufacturing overhead costs are fixed and the amounts occur in large increments. Some examples include depreciation on a company-owned factory, depreciation on machinery and equipment, salaries and benefits of manufacturing supervisors, factory administration costs, etc. One challenge for accountants is the allocation or assigning of the large fixed costs to the individual units of product (which likely vary in size and complexity). This allocation (or assigning or absorbing) is required by the accounting and income tax rules for valuing inventories and the cost of goods sold. If the fixed overhead is assigned using machine hours, one must keep in mind that the cost rate per machine hour is not how the fixed costs behave or occur. In our example, the cost of the rent might be assigned to the products at the rate of $3 or $4 per machine hour but the rent actually occurs at the rate of $10,000 per month.",what
What is the profit margin (after tax) ratio?,"The after tax profit margin ratio tells you the profit per sales dollar after all expenses are deducted from sales. In other words, the after tax profit margin ratio shows you the percentage of net sales that remains after deducting the cost of goods sold and all other expenses including income tax expense. The calculation is: Net Income after Tax divided by Net Sales.
The before tax profit margin ratio expresses the corporation's income before income tax expense as a percentage of net sales.
The profit margin ratio is most useful when it is compared to 1) the same company's profit margin ratios from earlier accounting periods, 2) the same company's targeted or planned profit margin ratio for the current accounting period, and 3) the profit margin ratios of other companies in the same industry during the same accounting period.",what
What is a learning curve?,"A common learning curve shows that the cumulative average time to complete a manual task which involves learning will decrease 20% whenever volume doubles. This is referred to as an 80% learning curve.
Let's illustrate the 80% learning curve with a person learning to design and code websites of similar size and complexity. If the first website takes 100 hours, then after the second website the cumulative average time will be 80 hours (80% of 100 hours). The cumulative average of 80 hours consists of 100 hours for the first website plus only 60 hours for the second website resulting in a total of 160 hours divided by 2 websites. After the fourth website the cumulative average time will be 64 hours (80% of 80 hours). After the eighth website the cumulative average will be 51.2 hours (80% of 64 hours). In other words, the total time to have completed all eight websites will be 409.6 hours (8 websites times an average time of 51.2 hours).
Improvements in technology can mean time and cost reductions beyond those in the learning curve. For example, software may become available to assist in the design and coding, computer processing speeds might increase, there may be lower costs of processing and storage, etc.
The learning curve is important for setting standards, estimating costs, and establishing selling prices.",what
What is a variable expense?,"An expense is a variable expense when its total amount changes in proportion to the change in sales, production, or some other activity. 
To illustrate a variable expense, let's assume that a website business sells a product and requires that the customer use a credit card. The credit card processor charges the business a fee of 3% of the amount charged. Therefore, in a month when sales are $10,000 the business will have a credit card expense of $300. If sales are $30,000 there will be a credit card expense of $900. The total credit card expense varies with sales because the fee has a fixed rate of 3% of sales.
Another example of a variable expense is a retailer's cost of goods sold. For instance, if a company purchases a product for $30 and then sells it for $50, its cost of goods sold will be a constant rate of 60%. Hence when its sales are $10,000 the cost of goods will be $6,000. When the sales are $30,000 the cost of goods sold will be $18,000.
Knowing how costs behave when sales or other activities change will allow you to better understand how a company's net income will change. It also allows you to quickly calculate a product's contribution margin and to estimate the company's break-even point.",what
How do we deal with a negative contribution margin ratio when calculating our break-even point?,"The negative contribution margin ratio indicates that your variable costs and expenses exceed your sales. In other words, if you increase your sales in the same proportion as the past, you will experience larger losses.
My recommendation is to calculate the contribution margin and contribution margin ratio for each product (or service) that you offer. I suspect that some of your items have positive contribution margins, but the products with negative contribution margins are greater. You must get into the details.
You also need to look at each of your customers. Perhaps some customers are buying in huge quantities, but those sales are not profitable. See which customers have positive contribution margins.
By definition, the ways to eliminate the negative contribution margin are to 1) raise selling prices, 2) reduce variable costs, or 3) do some combination of the first two. If customers will not accept price increases in order for you to cover your variable costs, you are probably better off not having the sales. Remember that after covering the variable costs, those selling prices must then cover the fixed costs and expenses. A total negative contribution margin means your loss will be larger than the amount of the fixed costs and expenses.
When setting prices or bidding for new work, you must think of the bottom line—profits. Many people focus too much on the top line—sales.",what
What is transfer pricing?,"Transfer pricing involves the price that one division (or other responsibility center) of a company charges for the goods or services that it provides to another division of the same company.
Depending on the production capacity and the market for each division's goods or services, a transfer price could be based on cost, market prices, or some other amount.
A concern of transfer pricing is whether the amount of the transfer price will cause a divisional manager to take action that is not consistent with the action that is best for the company as a whole.",what
What is zero-based budgeting?,"Zero-based budgeting, or ZBB, is a rigorous budgeting process that requires every dollar of every expense to be justified even if the expense has been occurring for many years. For example, if a company has been spending $100,000 each year for the rent of warehouse space, the zero-based budgeting process assumes that nothing was spent previously. As a result, the warehousing activities must be reviewed, justified and documented before any amount can be included in the budget.
Zero-based budgeting is in contrast to more common budgeting practices that focus on the incremental change from the current expenses and current budget. In other words, under a more typical budgeting process, the $100,000 of rent expense is accepted and the focus is on whether the rent for the upcoming budget should assume an inflation adjustment of $3,000 or some other amount. 
While zero-based budgeting will be far more time consuming than focusing on the incremental changes for the next budget, it can result in significant cost savings. For instance, the analysis and documentation of the warehousing activities required by zero-based budgeting could lead to a better use of space, better inventory management, etc. If those efficiencies will occur, the budget for the warehousing may need to be only $60,000 (instead of more than $100,000).
Zero-based budgeting was widely discussed in the 1970s for businesses and governments. Today, it is again being discussed since a few large corporations have used ZBB budgeting process to significantly reduce unneeded expenses.",what
How can a business increase its cash flow from operations?,"A business can increase its cash flow from operations (or operating activities) by looking closely at each of its current assets and current liabilities. For instance, a manufacturer should examine its inventories of materials, work-in-process, finished goods, and supplies to identify the inventory items which have not turned over in a long time. Those items may need to be scrapped so that a loss can be reported and cash will not flow for income taxes. It may also mean less cash flowing out for new materials. Reviewing the turnover of each and every item may allow the company to reduce the inventory quantities thereby freeing up cash that would have been sitting in inventory.
Accounts receivable needs to be monitored to be certain that every customer is adhering to the agreed upon credit terms and that the terms are consistent with your industry. You need to get those receivables turning to cash. Accounts payable should be reviewed to be sure that your company's cash is not being paid to suppliers prior to the required payment dates.
In addition to the in-depth review of each of the current assets and current liabilities, companies need to review its staffing in light of current levels of business and the recent advances in software and technology. Perhaps the company can function just fine with a few less salaried employees.
Lastly, the selling prices of some of a company's products, especially those that require lots of complex activities and result in many inefficiencies and headaches, may need to be increased.",what
What is a budget?,"A budget is a financial plan for future activities. The budgets used in business often include a sales or revenues budget detailed by products or services, production budgets, budgets for each department in the company, cash budget, capital expenditures budget, and others. The combination of all the budgets is referred to as the company's master budget or profit plan.
Budgets help management decide which activities it will undertake and how the company's resources will be used. If the budgeted income statement and balance sheet coming out of the master budget are not acceptable, management can make the needed changes before the year actually begins.
Budgets can also assist in controlling the actual costs, because managers realize that the costs of their activities will be compared to the budget.
The differences between the actual amounts occurring and the budgeted amounts are known as variances. These variances can also signal some new problems that need management's attention.",what
What is the difference between correlation and cause and effect?,"Correlation means that two or more sets of data move in some consistent pattern. Perhaps during a 10-year period the number of cars sold in the U.S. moved in the same direction as the country's rate of inflation. Even with a 10-year correlation between the two sets of data, it is unlikely that more inflation caused an increase in the number of cars sold. In other words, correlation does not assure that there is a cause and effect relationship.
On the other hand, if there is a cause and effect relationship, there will have to be correlation.",what
What is the difference between a differential cost and an incremental cost?,"I use the terms differential cost and incremental cost interchangeably. In other words, I believe the terms mean the same thing: the difference in cost between two alternatives. For example, if a company determined that the annual cost of operating at 80,000 machine hours was $4,000,000 while the annual cost of operating at 70,000 machine hours was $3,800,000, then the differential cost or incremental cost of the additional 10,000 machine hours was $200,000.
The term marginal cost refers to the cost of operating for one additional machine hour.",what
What are semivariable costs?,"Semivariable costs are costs or expenses whose behavior is partially fixed and partially variable. Semivariable costs are also referred to as mixed costs.
A common example of a semivariable cost is the annual cost of operating a vehicle. Some of the vehicle's operating costs will vary with the number of miles driven while other costs will be the same in total regardless of the miles driven. For example, the vehicle's fuel costs will be variable. However, the depreciation, insurance and licensing may be fixed. Looking only at the vehicle's maintenance costs may indicate that some maintenance is done each November (regardless of the number of miles driven) while other maintenance is done every 6,000 miles.
A manufacturer's electricity cost is another example of a semivariable cost. Part of the monthly electricity bill will include 1) a fixed amount, and 2) a separate amount based on the number of kilowatt hours of electricity actually used by the company.
The manufacturer's electricity cost is also a semivariable cost in relationship with the company's machine hours. The portion of the electricity cost used to operate the production equipment is variable, but the portion of the electricity cost used for lighting and air conditioning the manufacturing facility is a fixed cost.
These simple examples illustrate that it can be difficult to understand how costs behave. There are many factors, activities, and drivers that influence the level of costs.",what
What is simple linear regression analysis?,"Simple linear regression analysis is a statistical tool for quantifying the relationship between just one independent variable (hence ""simple"") and one dependent variable based on past experience (observations). For example, simple linear regression analysis can be used to express how a company's electricity cost (the dependent variable) changes as the company's production machine hours (the independent variable) change.
Fortunately there is software to compute the best fitting straight line (hence ""linear"") that expresses the past relationship between the dependent and independent variable. Continuing our example, you will enter 1) the amount of the past monthly electricity bills, and 2) the number of machine hours occurring during the period of each of the bills. Next, the software will likely use the least squares method to produce the formula for the best fitting line. The line will appear in the form y = a + bx. In addition, the software will provide statistics regarding the correlation, confidence, dispersion around the line, and more.
(In all likelihood there are many independent variables causing a change in the amount of the dependent variable. Therefore, you should not expect that only one independent variable will explain a high percentage of the change in the dependent variable. To increase the percentage, you should think of the many independent variables that could cause a change in the dependent variable. Next you should test the effect of the combination of these independent variables or drivers by using multiple regression analysis software.)
Prior to using simple linear regression analysis it is important to follow these preliminary steps:

seek an independent variable that is likely to cause or drive the change in the dependent variable
make certain that the past amounts for the independent variable occur in the exact same period as the amount of the dependent variable
plot the past observations on a graph using the y-axis for the cost (monthly electricity bill) and the x-axis for the activity (machine hours used during the exact period of the electricity bill)
review the plotted observations for a linear pattern and for any outliers
keep in mind that there can be correlation without cause and effect",what
What is the death spiral?,"In cost accounting and managerial accounting, the term death spiral refers to the repeated elimination of products resulting from spreading costs on the basis of volume instead of their root causes. The death spiral is also known as the downward demand spiral.
To illustrate the death spiral let's assume that Product X is a simple, high-volume product that requires little manufacturing attention. If the accountant spreads the company's manufacturing overhead costs based on volume, Product X will appear to have high overhead costs. (In reality, Product X causes very little overhead cost especially when compared to the company's many complex, low-volume products.) If management responds to Product X's allocated high overhead costs and 1) seeks a price increase which causes the customer to move the production to a competitor with a lower price, 2) outsources the production, or 3) drops the product, then the company's manufacturing volume will decrease.
If the company does not reduce its fixed overhead to correspond to the decreased manufacturing volume and the accountant continues to spread the overhead costs—including the cost of excess capacity—on the basis of volume, the remaining products will have to be assigned more of the overhead costs. If management again reacts to the new, higher, allocated costs by seeking price increases which cause a loss of sales, outsources production, or drops the products, the company's manufacturing volume will again decrease. If fixed costs are not decreased accordingly and the accountant again spreads the overhead on the basis of a new, even smaller volume, the entire company could die from the high fixed costs and a small volume of products being produced and sold.
To avoid the death spiral, some companies attempt to allocate overhead costs based on activities and product complexities rather than simply spreading them on volume. Also, some companies do not allocate the costs of excess capacity to products in order to minimize the death spiral.",what
What increases a break-even point?,"The break-even point will increase when the amount of fixed costs and expenses increases. The break-even point will also increase when the variable expenses increase without a corresponding increase in the selling prices.
A company with many products can see its break-even point increase when the mix of products changes. In other words, if a greater proportion of lower contribution margin products are sold, the break-even point will increase. (Contribution margin is selling price minus variable expenses.)",what
What is the cost to store inventory?,"The cost to store, hold or carry inventory consists of 1) the cost of the space used including rent, heat, maintenance, etc., 2) the cost of the money tied up in inventory, 3) the cost of insurance and perhaps property tax, and 4) the cost of deterioration and obsolescence of the inventory items.
Some of the storage costs are a function of the cost or value of the inventory, while some storage costs are dependent on the physical size of the items. The costs to store or hold inventory are often stated on an annual basis, such as $3 per unit or 15% of an item's cost.
The calculation of the cost to store inventory should be based on the incremental annual costs or the company's opportunity costs. In other words, if a business has a large amount of cash, no debt, and a warehouse that is half empty, its costs to store inventory will be relatively low. Another company with little cash, much debt, and little available storage space will have relatively high costs of storing inventory.
The costs to store inventory are part of the economic order quantity (EOQ) formula or model that calculates the optimum order quantity. The economic order quantity is the number of units that will minimize the total annual costs of both ordering and storing inventory.",what
What does stepped cost mean?,"Stepped cost refers to the behavior of the total cost of an activity at various levels of the activity. When a stepped cost is plotted on a graph (with the total cost represented by the y-axis and the quantity of the activity represented by the x-axis) the lines will appear as steps or stairs rising from left to right.
To illustrate a stepped cost, let's assume that you are developing a website and find that the monthly cost of hosting the site is based on the number of visits. For 0 to 999 visits per month, the cost is $20 per month. When the visits are in the range of 1,000 to 2,999 the monthly cost jumps to $50. If the visits are 3,000 to 9,999 the cost will be $200 per month. For monthly visits of 10,000 to 24,999 the cost is $300, and so on. As the data indicates, the total monthly cost is constant or fixed only for a given range of activity (number of visits). When the number of visits exceeds the upper limit of a range, the monthly cost jumps to a higher level and remains fixed until the visits exceed the new upper limit.
A stepped cost is also referred to as a step cost, a step-variable cost, or a step-fixed cost. The difference between a step-variable cost and a step-fixed cost has to do with the width of the range of activity. If the total cost increases with small increases in activity, it may be referred to as a step-variable cost. If the total cost will change only with large increases in the quantity of activity, the term step-fixed cost is more likely to be used.
Knowing how costs behave is important for decision making. For example, a manufacturer will want to know how its costs will increase if a new product line is added (or how costs could decrease if an existing product line is eliminated).",what
What is the tax advantage when bonds are issued instead of stock?,"The tax advantage of issuing bonds (or other debt) instead of stock results from the interest paid by the company being a deductible expense on its federal and state income tax returns. Dividends paid to stockholders are not a deductible expense, since dividends are a distribution of profits to the owners of the corporation.
The size of the advantage depends on the income tax rate of the company paying the interest. For example, if a corporation issues $10,000,000 of bonds with an interest rate of 8%, its annual interest expense will be $800,000. When the $800,000 of interest expense is entered on the corporation's income tax return, its taxable income will decrease by $800,000. If the corporation's combined federal and state income tax rate on this increment is 40%, the corporation will avoid or save paying income taxes of $320,000 ($800,000 of less taxable income X 40%). If the corporation's income tax rate on this increment is 30%, the corporation will save paying income taxes of $240,000 ($800,000 X 30%).
Due to the income tax savings, the cost of the borrowed money is reduced. For a corporation in the 40% tax bracket, its net cost of the borrowed money is $480,000 ($800,000 of interest minus $320,000 of income tax savings) for a net rate of 4.8% ($480,000 of net expense divided by $10,000,000). For a corporation with a combined tax rate of 30%, the net cost of the borrowed money will be $560,000 or a net rate of 5.6% of $10,000,000.",what
Which financial ratios are considered to be efficiency ratios?,"I consider the efficiency ratios to be the ratios also known as asset turnover ratios, activity ratios, or asset management ratios.
These efficiency ratios include 1) accounts receivable turnover ratio, and the related ratio days' credit sales in accounts receivable; 2) inventory turnover, and the related ratio days' cost of sales in inventory; 3) total asset turnover; and 4) fixed asset turnover.
The accounts receivable turnover ratio and the inventory turnover ratio are also used in the context of a firm's liquidity.
The total asset turnover and fixed asset turnover are indicators of a company's effectiveness in utilizing its assets.",what
Are insurance premiums a fixed cost?,"The cost of the insurance premiums for a company's property insurance is likely to be a fixed cost. The cost of worker compensation insurance is likely to be a variable cost. Whether a cost is a fixed cost, a variable cost, or a mixed cost depends on the independent variable.
Let's illustrate this by looking at the cost of property insurance. The cost of insuring the factory building is a fixed cost when the independent variable is the number of units produced within the factory. In other words, the factory's property insurance might be $6,000 per year whether its output is 2 million units, 3 million units, or 5 million units. On the other hand, if the independent variable is the replacement cost of the factory buildings, the insurance cost will be a variable cost. The reason is the insurance cost on $12 million of factory buildings will be more than the insurance cost on $9 million of factory buildings, and less than the insurance premiums on $18 million of factory buildings.
In the case of worker compensation insurance, the cost will vary with the amount of payroll dollars (excluding overtime premium) in each class of workers. For example, if the worker comp premiums are $5 per $100 of factory labor cost, then the worker comp premiums will be variable with respect to the dollars of factory labor cost. If the units of output in the factory correlate with the direct labor costs, then the worker compensation cost will also be variable with respect to the number of units produced. On the other hand, the worker compensation cost for the office staff is usually a much smaller rate and that worker compensation cost will not be variable with respect to the number of units of output in the factory. However, the worker compensation cost of the office staff will be variable with respect to the amount of office staff salaries and wages.
As you have seen, determining which costs are fixed and which are variable can be a bit tricky.",what
Are liabilities always a bad thing?,"Liabilities are obligations and are usually defined as a claim on assets. However, liabilities and stockholders' equity are also the sources of assets. Generally, liabilities are considered to have a lower cost than stockholders' equity. On the other hand, too many liabilities result in additional risk.
Some liabilities have low interest rates and some have no interest associated with them. For example, some of a company's accounts payable may allow payment in 30 days. With those payables it is better to have the liability and to keep your cash in the bank until they become due.
In our personal lives, our first house was probably purchased with a down payment and mortgage loan. That mortgage loan was a big liability, but it allowed us to upgrade our living space. I viewed my mortgage loan liability as a good thing because it allowed me to own a nice home in a beautiful neighborhood.
So some liabilities are good—especially the ones that have a very low interest rate. Too many liabilities could cause financial hardships.",what
What is a limitation of the inventory turnover ratio?,"One limitation of the inventory turnover ratio is that it tells you the average number of times per year that a company's inventory has been sold. For example, if during the past year a company had sales of $7 million, cost of goods sold of $5 million, and its inventory cost averaged $1 million, the company's inventory turnover was on average 5 ($5 million of cost of goods sold divided by $1 million of inventory cost). A turnover ratio of 5 indicates that on average the inventory had turned over every 72 or 73 days (360 or 365 days per year divided by the turnover of 5).
However, the average turnover ratio of 5 might be hiding some important details. What if four items make up 40% of the company's sales and account for only 10% of the inventory cost? These fast selling items will have a turnover ratio of 20 (cost of goods sold of $2,000,000 divided by their average inventory cost of $100,000) meaning these items turn every 18 days (360 days divided by the turnover of 20). This means that the remaining items in inventory will have a cost of goods sold of $3,000,000 and their average inventory cost will be $900,000. As a result, the majority of the items in inventory will have an average turnover ratio of 3.3 ($3,000,000 divided by $900,000). In other words, the majority of items are turning on average every 109 days (360 days divided by the turnover ratio of 3.3). That's a significant difference from the 72 days that we first computed on the totals.
People within the company can overcome the shortcomings described above, since they have access to all of the sales and inventory detail. A computer generated report can compute the inventory turnover ratio and the days' sales in inventory for each and every item sold and/or held in inventory. By reviewing each item, the slow moving items will not be hidden behind an average.",what
What are the benefits of a revenue budget?,"The main benefit of a revenue budget is that it requires looking into the future. The revenue budget should contain the assumptions made about the future and the details about the number of units to be sold, the expected selling prices, and so on.
The budgeted amount of revenue is then compared to the budgeted amount of expenses in order to determine if the revenues are adequate. Learning of a potential problem before the year begins is a huge benefit because it allows for alternative actions to be developed prior to the start of the new year.
When an annual revenue budget is detailed by month, each month's actual revenues can be compared to the budgeted amount. Similarly, the actual year-to-date revenues can be compared to the budgeted revenues for the same period. In other words, monthly revenue budgets allow you to monitor revenues as the year progresses instead of being surprised at the end of the year.
Let's illustrate the benefits of a church's revenue budget. A church's annual revenue budget should be prepared independently of the expense budget. The total of the revenue budget is then compared to the annual expense budget. If the annual revenue budget is less than the annual expense budget, action can be taken to develop additional revenues or to reduce the planned expenses before the accounting year begins.
An additional benefit occurs when the annual revenue budget is also detailed by month.  Let's assume that the church's monthly revenue budgets will vary by the number of days of worship in the month, the time of year, and other factors. As a result, an annual budget of $370,000 might consist of the following sequence of  monthly amounts: $26,000 + $28,000 + $35,000 + $30,000 + $30,000 + $32,000 + $27,000 + $28,000 + $30,000 + $28,000 + $30,000 + $46,000. Based on these budgeted or planned monthly revenues, the church is expecting to have revenues of $181,000 for the first six months. If the actual revenues for the first six months are only $173,000 the church officials will see that an $8,000 problem at mid-year needs to be addressed. The shortfall also raises the question of whether there will be a similar shortage in the second half of the year. Thanks to the monthly revenue budget, church officials will be alerted early enough to find a solution. The solution could include a message to members asking for additional contributions, an edict to cut expenses for the remainder of the year, and so on.
Preparing a detailed, realistic budget requires you to plan ahead. This in turn gives you insights prior to the start of the accounting year. Monthly revenue budgets allow you to monitor the receipts right from the beginning of the year.",what
Would you please help me understand opportunity cost?,"You might think of opportunity cost as the profit you had to forego.
Let's illustrate this with a little story. Suppose that you are the sole owner of a company which uses a special machine to produce a very unique product. Your company has a huge backlog of orders for the product. Every hour that the machine is running, your company is able to generate sales of $500 while incurring incremental costs and expenses of $200. As a result, your company's profit is increasing by $300 for each hour that the machine is running.
Now suppose an employee failed to perform a routine maintenance task which causes the machine to be shut down for 10 hours. The repair bill to get the machine running was $400. What was the cost of the machine being down for 10 hours? The accounting records will report $400 in the account Repairs and Maintenance Expense. But as the owner, you are likely to be more upset that the employee cost you $3,000 (10 hours X $300) in lost profits and upset customers.
In the above story the opportunity cost was $3,000 of lost profit + the cost of the upset customers. (From the owner's perspective, the total cost was the $400 repair bill + $3,000 of opportunity cost described above + the opportunity cost consisting of future lost profits from lost customers.)
Now let's modify the story. Suppose the machine that was idled by employee negligence was not a special machine and there was no backlog of orders for the product. The repair bill was the same $400. In this situation you will not be foregoing any sales or losing any customers. Therefore the profit foregone is $0. In other words, there is no opportunity cost of the machine being down for 10 hours. All you have is the $400 repair bill.
This concept of opportunity cost is relevant in making decisions. For example, in deciding whether to make or to buy a component, the opportunity cost is an important consideration: If your plant has idle capacity, you might opt to make a component because there is no opportunity cost—no profit being foregone as you spend time making the component. On the other hand, if your plant is operating at full capacity, you would have to forego the profit on some items presently being produced (an opportunity cost) in order to make the components.
The concept of opportunity cost is also relevant when setting transfer prices between divisions or subsidiaries of a large company.",what
What is a sunk cost?,"A sunk cost is a cost that was incurred in the past and cannot be undone. Since most transactions cannot be undone, most amounts spent in the past can be described as sunk. In other words, a past or sunk cost will be there regardless of what you decide to do today or in the future.
To illustrate a sunk cost, let's assume that a company spent $100,000 last year to purchase and install a machine. Today, a better machine is available for $80,000 and it will reduce expenses by $50,000 in each of the next 10 years. Now the old machine can be sold for just $10,000. When deciding whether to purchase the new machine, the $100,000 that was spent on the old machine is a sunk cost. 
Basically the decision is whether to spend an additional $70,000 today ($80,000 minus $10,000) in order to save $50,000 each year for 10 years. (Current and future income taxes will also be relevant.) It may be difficult, but we need to exclude sunk costs from our decisions.",what
What happens when the high-low method ends up with a negative amount?,"The high-low method of determining the fixed and variable portions of a mixed cost relies on only two sets of data: 1) the costs at the highest level of activity, and 2) the costs at the lowest level of activity. If either set of data is flawed, the calculation can result in an unreasonable, negative amount of fixed cost.
To illustrate the problem, let's assume that the total cost is $1,200 when there are 100 units of product manufactured, and $6,000 when there are 400 units of product are manufactured. The high-low method computes the variable cost rate by dividing the change in the total costs by the change in the number of units of manufactured. In other words, the $4,800 change in total costs is divided by the change in units of 300 to yield the variable cost rate of $16 per unit of product. Since the fixed costs are the total costs minus the variable costs, the fixed costs will be calculated to a negative $400. This unacceptable answer results from total costs of $1,200 at the low point minus the variable costs of $1,600 (100 units times $16), or total costs of $6,000 at the high point minus the variable costs of $6,400 (400 units times $16).
The negative amount of fixed costs is not realistic and leads me to believe that either the total costs at either the high point or at the low point are not representative. This brings to light the importance of plotting or graphing all of the points of activity and their related costs before using the high-low method. (The number of units uses the scale on the x-axis and the related total cost at each level of activity uses the scale on the y-axis.) It is possible that at the highest point of activity the costs were out of line from the normal relationship—referred to as an outlier. You may decide to use the second highest level of activity, if the related costs are more representative.
If the $6,000 of cost at the 400 units of activity is an outlier, you might select the next highest activity of 380 units having total costs of $4,000. Now the variable rate will be the change in total costs of $2,800 ($4,000 minus $1,200) divided by the change in the units manufactured of 280 (380 minus 100) for a variable rate of $10 per unit of product. Using the variable rate of $10 per unit manufactured will result in the fixed costs being a positive $200. The positive $200 of fixed costs is calculated at either 1) the low activity: total costs of $1,200 minus the variable costs of $1,000 (100 units at $10); or at 2) the high activity: total costs of $4,000 minus the variable costs of $3,800 (380 units at $10).",what
What causes a variation in profit margin and turnover ratios between industries?,"Mega grocery stores, discount stores, and warehouse clubs often have small profit margins but have high turnover ratios. The small profit margins as a percent of sales exist because of intense competition. The inventory turnover ratios are high because the stores feature the fast selling brands at low prices. Their strategy is that huge sales volumes with small profit margins will still result in adequate net income dollars.
In contrast to the stores with low profit margins and high turnover ratios, is a heavy equipment manufacturer with a high demand product that takes six months to manufacture. If this manufacturer has few or no competitors, a great product, and an excellent reputation for service, its profit margin can be very large. Unlike the discount stores, its inventory turnover will be very very low.
There can also be differences within the same industry. For example, one computer company might assemble and ship computers within hours of receiving the order via its website. Its inventory turnover will be off the charts, perhaps 90 times per year. If most of its customers pay with credit cards at the time the computer is shipped, the company will have very little in accounts receivable and will enjoy great cash flow. Another computer company might sell only through retailers. This company will have to assemble the computers in advance, store them, and then extend 60 days credit to the retailers. Obviously its turnover ratios will be less impressive than the ratios of the first company.
A company's management is another variable that explains differences in the profit margin and turnover ratios. Some managements are more focused, aggressive and disciplined in processing orders, controlling inventory. and improving processes. Companies with less proficient managers could end up having less impressive turnover ratios and profits.",what
Why would the cost behavior change outside of the relevant range of activity?,"Cost behavior often changes outside of the relevant range of activity due to a change in the fixed costs. When volume increases to a certain point, more fixed costs will have to be added. When volume shrinks significantly, some fixed costs could be eliminated.
Here's an illustration. A company manufactures products in its 100,000 square foot plant. The company's depreciation on the plant is $1,000,000 per year. The capacity of the plant is 500,000 units of output and its normal output is 400,000 units per year. When the company is manufacturing between 300,000 and 500,000 units, it needs salaried managers earning $400,000 per year. Below 300,000 units of output, some of the salaried manager positions would be eliminated. Above 500,000 units, the company will need to add plant space and managers.
For this example, the relevant range is between 300,000 units and 500,000 units of output per year. In that range the total of the two fixed costs is $1,400,000 per year. Below 300,000 units, the fixed costs will drop to less than $1,400,000 because some salaries will be eliminated and some of the space might be rented. When the volume exceeds 500,000 units per year, the company will need to add fixed costs because of the additional space and the additional managers. Perhaps the total fixed costs will be $2,000,000 for output between 500,000 units and 700,000 units.",what
What is synergy?,"In business the term synergy is often associated with the merger or acquisition of companies.  Synergy implies that the outcomes resulting from the merger of two companies will be greater than the sum of the outcomes that would have been achieved if the organizations had not merged. Synergy is sometimes described as 1 + 1 = 3.
Let's use an example. Suppose a company operates solely in the U.S. Another company operates in Asia. The two companies decide to merge because they believe the combined company will have greater results than the total of the two companies operating independently. The synergy might come from shared research, ability to meet the needs of each other's customers, ability to attract new customers that want a single global supplier, elimination of duplicate information technology, and so on.
Synergy is not automatic since the merging organizations may experience problems caused by vastly different leadership styles and company cultures.",what
What is the break-even formula?,"Break-even Point in Units of Product
The formula for determining the break-even point in units of product sold is: total fixed expenses divided by the contribution margin per unit. For example, if a company's total fixed expenses for a year are $300,000 and it has a contribution margin of $4 per unit (selling price of $10 per unit minus variable expenses of $6 per unit), the company's break-even point in sales for the year is 75,000 units.
Break-even Point in Billable Service Hours
For a service business, the units could be the company's hours billed to clients. For example, if the business has total fixed expenses of $300,000 for a year and it has a contribution margin of $40 per billable hour (hourly billing rate of $100 minus variable expenses of $60 per hour), the break-even point for the year is 7,500 hours billed at $100 per hour.
Break-even Point in Dollars of Revenue
The formula for determining the break-even point in dollars of product or services is the total fixed expenses divided by the contribution margin ratio (or %). For instance, if a company has total fixed expenses for a year of $300,000 and a contribution margin ratio of 40%, the break-even point for the year in revenue dollars is $750,000.
Limitation of Break-even Formula
The break-even formula is overly simplistic for computing a company's break-even point if the company has a wide variety of products (and/or services) with varying contribution margins and contribution margin ratios.",what
What is opportunity cost?,"Opportunity cost is the profit that was lost or missed because of some action or failure to take some action.
To illustrate opportunity cost, let's assume that you want to add a website to your already successful business. You are confident that it will increase your company's profit by $1,500 each week. A highly-trusted and successful firm will complete the website in 3 weeks with a total cost of $10,000. A friend has offered to do the work for $6,500 but it will take 5 weeks.
Choosing your friend looks better because the $3,500 saved ($6,500 instead of $10,00) is less than the opportunity cost of $3,000 (the $1,500 per week that is not earned multiplied times the additional 2 weeks it will take your friend to develop the website).
Now let's assume that your friend will require 7 weeks to complete the website. This means that your business will be losing the opportunity to earn an additional $1,500 per week for 4 weeks (your friend's 7 weeks instead of the firm's 3 weeks). That opportunity cost of $6,000 plus the $6,500 payment means a total cost of $12,500 if your friend develops the website. Hence, you would be better off paying the firm $10,000 and the benefit of having the site working 4 weeks sooner.
Interestingly, the opportunity costs are not recorded in the general ledger accounts. Hence, only the $6,500 paid to your friend will be recorded as the cost of the website. (The 4 weeks of missed profits are not recorded and will not be widely discussed.)
This is also a reminder that the opportunity costs and future amounts are the important ones for making decisions. Unfortunately, the future amounts are not in the general ledger and are probably not known at the time a decision has to be made.",what
What is the coefficient of determination?,"The coefficient of determination is a statistic which indicates the percentage change in the amount of the dependent variable that is ""explained by"" the changes in the independent variables.
For example, a manufacturer may have found through simple linear regression analysis involving 15 monthly observations that 64% of the change in the total cost of electricity (the dependent variable) was associated with the change in the monthly production machine hours (the independent variable). In this example the coefficient of determination is 0.64 or 64%.
The coefficient of determination is symbolized by r-squared, where r is the coefficient of correlation. Hence, a coefficient of determination of 0.64 or 64% means that the coefficient of correlation was 0.8 or 80%. (The range for the coefficient of correlation is -1 to +1, and therefore the range for the coefficient of determination is 0 to +1.)
It is important to note that a high coefficient of determination does not guarantee that a cause-and-effect relationship exists. However, a cause-and-effect relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable will result in a high coefficient of determination.",what
What is benchmarking?,"Benchmarking is a process for improving some activity within an organization. We will illustrate benchmarking with the following example.
Company Q has identified one of its activities that needs improvement. The company conducts a search to find another organization that is considered to have mastered the activity. Perhaps it is Corporation J that is recognized as having the best practice for this activity. Corporation J's performance is viewed as the benchmark or standard or best practice.
Company Q will study Corporation J's performance and procedures in depth and will identify the differences between the organizations. Company Q will likely modify its procedures in order to bring its performance of the activity up to the level attained by Corporation J.",what
What is NIFO?,"NIFO is the acronym for next-in, first-out.
NIFO is a cost flow assumption, just as FIFO and LIFO are cost flow assumptions. However, NIFO is not acceptable for financial reporting since it calls for a future cost. NIFO is sometimes used as an expression of replacement cost.
Even though NIFO cannot be used for valuing inventory and the cost of goods sold on the financial statements, it is useful for making decisions. For example, some companies will use NIFO when determining selling prices.",what
What is an independent variable?,"In accounting, an independent variable is ideally a factor that causes a change in the total amount of the dependent variable. In other words, an independent variable should be something that drives a mixed cost to increase or decrease.
To illustrate, let's assume that a manufacturer's production equipment uses a significant amount of electricity. Hence, the monthly electricity cost (the dependent variable) will increase when there is an increase in the number of production machine hours (the independent variable).
In reality there are likely to be many independent variables that cause a change in the amount of the dependent variable. In the case of the monthly electricity cost, the independent variables could also include the non-production machines using electricity, the physical size of the products, the skill level of the operators, the outside temperature and humidity, etc.
Multiple regression analysis is a statistical tool that can assist in determining the significant independent variables.",what
What is the reorder point?,"The reorder point is the quantity of units in inventory that will trigger an order to purchase additional units. Let's assume that a company's reorder point for its Product X is 80 units. When the inventory of Product X drops to 80 units, the company places an order for additional units of Product X.
The reorder point is calculated by 1) estimating the sales in the near future, 2) estimating the number of days between ordering and receiving the additional units, and 3) the number of units of safety stock.
The reorder point indicates when to place an order. The economic order quantity indicates the optimum number of units to be ordered.",what
"In least squares regression, what do y and a represent?","Here are the meanings of the components or symbols used in the least squares equation of y = a + bx:
y is the dependent variable, such as the estimated or expected total cost of electricity during a month. The amount of y is dependent upon the amounts of a and bx.
a is the estimated total amount of fixed electricity costs during the month. It is the value of y, when x is zero. If the total cost line intersects the y-axis at $1,000 then it is assumed that the total fixed costs for a month are $1,000.
b is the estimated variable cost per unit of x. It determines the slope of the total cost line. If b is $5, this means that the variable cost portion of electricity is estimated to be $5 for every unit of x.
x is the independent variable. For example, x could represent the known number of machine hours used in the month.
bx is the total variable cost of electricity. If the company's electricity cost is estimated to be $5 per unit of x, and x is 4,000 machine hours, then the total variable cost of electricity for the month is estimated to be $20,000.
In our example the total estimated cost of electricity (y) in a month when x is 4,000 machine hours will be $21,000.",what
Should a manufacturer's selling prices be based on costs?,"A manufacturer's selling prices should not be based on costs alone. One reason is that the actual cost of each product is not known with precision. At best, each product's cost is an average that resulted from allocations of the indirect manufacturing costs. In addition, there are selling, general and administrative expenses that are even more difficult to associate with individual products.
A more compelling reason that selling prices should not be based solely on costs is the market for a product. If a product is unique, protected by a patent and trademark, and the demand for the product is high, customers may accept a selling price that is unusually high. In other words, the value of the product is much greater than the costs identified with the product plus a normal profit or markup.
At other times the market will include competitors offering a similar product at lower selling prices because of efficiencies, lower costs, or inaccurate cost calculations. Perhaps another competitor will sell a similar product at a lower selling price in hopes of attracting customers who will buy additional, more profitable products. These situations will likely prevent the manufacturer from achieving significant sales at selling prices that are based on costs plus a desired profit.
Given the complexity of a manufacturer's operations and the competition in the market place, it is rare for a manufacturer to have selling prices based on its true costs plus a uniform rate of profit.",what
What is the rule of 72?,"The rule of 72 is a simple formula that tells you the approximate amount of time or interest rate needed for an amount to double. The formula is Years X Rate per year = 72.
Here's how it works. If you invest an amount for 8 years at 9% annual interest it will double (because 8 years X 9% = 72). If you invest an amount for 9 years at 8% it will also double (since 9 years X 8% = 72). If your investment earns 6%, it will take 12 years for it to double (since 12 years X 6% = 72; or 72 divided by 6 = 12).
If you invest $1,000 at 12% compounded annually, it will grow to approximately $2,000 in 6 years (6 X 12 = 72; or 72/12 = 6). If the $2,000 continues to earn 12% each year, six years later the investment will be worth $4,000. If the investment continues to earn 12% per year, then in six more years it will have a value of $8,000.
If successful investors were able to earn 18% each year, the value of their portfolios would have doubled every four years (72 divided by 18 = 4). If the investors live a long life and continue to earn 18% compounded annually they will become very wealthy.",what
What is value billing?,"Value billing is a way of billing a client for services provided. Basically, the amount billed is based on the value of the service (or information) instead of the number of hours spent.
The following illustrates value billing. The owner of a successful company contacts an accounting firm for tax advice. Two tax experts have lunch with the owner and inform her how to process transactions so that she will enjoy tax savings of $40,000. The owner was grateful for the enjoyable lunch and the valuable information. Several days later, she receives a bill for $2,500 and is surprised at the amount. She concludes that the tax experts billed her based on the amount of money they had saved her. In other words, the tax experts had utilized the concept of value billing.",what
How much of the contribution margin is profit on units sold in excess of the break-even point? ,"After the break-even point is reached, the entire contribution margin on the next units sold will be profit...provided the total fixed costs and expenses do not increase.
The reason lies in the definition of contribution margin: selling price minus the variable costs and expenses. Once the contribution margins have covered the total amount of fixed costs and expenses, the entire contribution margin on the next units will go to profit.",what
Are there two ABC methods in accounting?,"Some accountants use ABC to mean Activity Based Costing. Under this ABC a manufacturer will use many cost drivers to assign overhead costs to products. The objective of Activity Based Costing is to assign the overhead costs based on their root causes rather than merely spreading the costs on the basis of direct labor hours or production machine hours.
A second use of ABC involves categorizing inventory items into ""A"" items, ""B"" items, and ""C"" items. The ""A"" items are a relatively small number of items which account for the majority of the inventory's value. For example, the ""A"" items might be 20% of the items in inventory which account for 70% of the inventory value. At the other extreme the ""C"" items might be 60% of the items in inventory but they account for only 10% of the inventory value. The ""B"" items might be 20% of the items accounting for 20% of the inventory value. Under this system, the ""A"" items will receive the most attention since they account for 70% of the value. This ABC is sometimes referred to as Pareto analysis or Pareto's rule and it can be applied to more than inventory. For example, 20% of a company's customers might account for 70% of the company's sales.",what
What is cash flow net of tax?,"I view cash flow net of tax as the amount of cash spent minus the income tax savings when the amount is deductible on the corporation's income tax return.
To illustrate this, let's assume that a U.S. corporation pays a combined federal and state income tax rate of 40% on its last increment of income. If this corporation spends an additional $10,000 for a tax deductible business expense, its taxable income will decrease by $10,000. This means that the corporation will save paying $4,000 in income taxes ($10,000 less of taxable income being taxed at 40%).
In this situation, the cash flow net of tax is $6,000 consisting of the $10,000 paid for the business expense minus the $4,000 of income taxes that will not have to be paid.",what
How do I calculate the amount of sales tax that is included in total receipts?,"Sales Tax Calculation
To calculate the sales tax that is included in a company's receipts, divide the total amount received (for the items that are subject to sales tax) by ""1 + the sales tax rate"". In other words, if the sales tax rate is 6%, divide the sales taxable receipts by 1.06. If the sales tax rate is 7.25%, divide the sales taxable receipts by 1.0725.
Example of the Sales Tax Calculation
As an example, assume that all of the items in a vending machine are subject to a sales tax of 7%. In the most recent month the vending machine receipts were $481.50. Hence, $481.50 includes the amounts received for the sales of products and the sales tax on these products. The use of algebra allows us to calculate how much of the $481.50 is the true sales amount and how much is the sales tax on those products:
Let S = the true sales of products (excluding the sales tax), and let 0.07S = the sales tax on the true sales. Since the true sales + the sales tax = $481.50, we can state this as S + 0.07S = 1.07S = $481.50. We solve for S by dividing $481.50 by 1.07. The result is that the true product sales amounted to $450. The 7% of sales tax on the true sales is $31.50 ($450 X 0.07). Now let's make sure this adds up: $450 of sales of product + $31.50 of sales tax = $481.50, which was the total amount of the vending machine receipts.
Additional Example of the Sales Tax Calculation
Now let's assume that total amount of a company's receipts including a 7% sales tax is $32,100. The true sales will be S, and the sales tax will be 0.07S. Therefore, S + 0.07S = 1.07S = $32,100. The true sales, S, will be $30,000 ($32,100 divided by 1.07). The sales tax on the true sales will be 0.07 X $30,000 = $2,100. Our proof is $30,000 of sales + $2,100 of sales tax = $32,100. In general journal form the accounting entry to record this information is: debit Cash $32,100; credit Sales $30,000; credit Sales Tax Payable $2,100.",what
What is the cost of goods sold?,"Definition of Cost of Goods Sold
The cost of goods sold is the cost of the products that a retailer, distributor, or manufacturer has sold.
The cost of goods sold is reported on the income statement and should be viewed as an expense of the accounting period. In essence, the cost of goods sold is being matched with the revenues from the goods sold, thereby achieving the matching principle of accounting.
When the cost of goods sold is subtracted from net sales, the result is the company's gross profit.
Examples of Calculating the Cost of Goods Sold
One way to calculate a retailer's cost of goods sold is to begin with the cost of the goods it had purchased during the accounting period and then adjust it for the change in inventory. For example, if 1,000 units of a company's only product were purchased but its inventory increased by 100 units, then the cost of 900 units will be the cost of goods sold. If 1,000 units of the product were purchased but the inventory decreased by 100 units then the cost of 1,100 units will be the cost of goods sold.
Using dollar amounts, let's assume that a retailer's cost of its merchandise purchases for a year was $300,000 while the cost of its inventory increased from $100,000 to $120,000. The result is that its cost of goods sold is $280,000 (purchases of $300,000 minus the $20,000 increase in inventory).
A second way to calculate the cost of goods sold is: the cost of the beginning inventory + the cost of goods purchased = cost of goods available - cost of ending inventory. Using the amounts above, we have $100,000 + $300,000 = $400,000 - $120,000 = $280,000.
If the cost of the ending inventory were $65,000, the cost of goods sold would have been $335,000 (purchases of $300,000 + the $35,000 decrease in inventory). 
Cost Flow Assumption Is Needed
When costs change during the accounting period, a cost flow will have to be assumed. Some common cost flow assumptions include FIFO, LIFO, and average.",what
What is a capital expenditure versus a revenue expenditure?,"Definition of Capital Expenditure
A capital expenditure is an amount spent to acquire or significantly improve the capacity or capabilities of a long-term asset such as equipment or buildings. Usually the cost is recorded in a balance sheet account that is reported under the heading of Property, Plant and Equipment. The asset's cost (except for the cost of land) will then be allocated to depreciation expense over the useful life of the asset. The amount of each period's depreciation expense is also credited to the contra-asset account Accumulated Depreciation.
Examples of Capital Expenditures
Examples of capital expenditures include the amounts spent to acquire or significantly improve assets such as land, buildings, equipment, furnishings, fixtures, vehicles. The total amount spent on capital expenditures during an accounting year is reported under investment activities on the statement of cash flows.
Definition of Revenue Expenditure
A revenue expenditure is an amount that is spent for an expense that will be matched immediately with the revenues reported on the current period's income statement.
Examples of Revenue Expenditures
Examples of revenue expenditures include the amounts spent on repairs and maintenance, selling, general and administrative expenses.",what
What is the difference between the cash basis and the accrual basis of accounting?,"Definition of the Cash Basis of Accounting

Revenues are reported on the income statement in the period in which the cash is received from customers.
Expenses are reported on the income statement when the cash is paid out.

Definition of the Accrual Basis of Accounting
The accrual basis of accounting provides a better picture of a company's profits during an accounting period for the following reasons:

Revenues are reported on the income statement when they are earned, which often occurs before the cash is received from the customers.
Expenses are reported on the income statement in the period when they match up with the related revenues, occur, or expire, which is often in a period different from the period when the payment is made.

The accrual basis of accounting also provides a better picture of a company's financial position at the end of the accounting year. The reason is that all assets that were earned are reported and all liabilities that were incurred will be reported on the balance sheet.
The accrual basis of accounting is required because of the matching principle.",what
What is a contingent liability?,"Definition of Contingent Liability
A contingent liability is a potential liability that may or may not become an actual liability. Whether the contingent liability becomes an actual liability depends on a future event occurring or not occurring.
In accounting, some contingent liabilities and their related contingent losses are:

Recorded with a journal entry
Are limited to a disclosure in the notes to the financial statements
Not recorded or disclosed

We have another Q&A that discusses the recording of contingent liabilities.
Examples of Contingent Liability
A company's supplier is unable to obtain a bank loan. The company agrees to guarantee that the supplier's bank loan will be repaid. As a result of the company's guarantee, the bank makes the loan to the supplier. The company has a contingent liability. If the supplier makes the loan payments needed to pay off the loan, the company will have no liability. If the supplier fails to repay the bank, the company will have an actual liability.
If a company is sued by a former employee for $500,000 for age discrimination, the company has a contingent liability. If the company is found guilty, it will have an actual liability. However, if the company is not found guilty, the company will not have any liability.
A product warranty is also a contingent liability.",what
Where do dividends appear on the financial statements?,"Definition of Dividends
Cash dividends are a distribution of a company's profits.
Financial Statements of a Corporation
The main financial statements of a corporation are:

income statement
statement of comprehensive income
balance sheet
statement of cash flows
statement of stockholders' equity

Where Dividends Appear on the Financial Statements
The dividends declared and paid by a corporation in the most recent year will be reported on these financial statements for the recent year:

statement of cash flows as a use of cash under the heading financing activities
statement of stockholders' equity as a subtraction from retained earnings

Dividends that were declared but not yet paid are reported on the balance sheet under the heading current liabilities.
Dividends on common stock are not reported on the income statement since they are not expenses. However, dividends on preferred stock will appear on the income statement as a subtraction from net income in order to report the earnings available for common stock.",what
What are accrued expenses and when are they recorded?,"Accrued Expenses
Accrued expenses are expenses that have occurred but are not yet recorded in the company's general ledger. This means these expenses will not appear on the financial statements unless an adjusting entry is entered prior to issuing the financial statements.
Example of an Accrued Expense
To illustrate an accrued expense, let's assume that a company borrowed $200,000 on December 1. The agreement requires that the company repay the $200,000 on February 28 along with $6,000 of interest for the three months of December through February. As of December 31, the company will not have an invoice to process and will not be paying the interest until it is due on February 28.
Recording an Accrued Expense
Without an adjusting entry to accrue the interest expense that was incurred by the company in December, the company's financial statements as of December 31 will not be reporting the $2,000 of interest (one-third of the $6,000) that the company has incurred in December. In order for the financial statements to be correct on the accrual basis of accounting, the accountant must record an adjusting entry dated as of December 31. The adjusting entry will consist of a debit of $2,000 to Interest Expense (an income statement account) and a credit of $2,000 to Interest Payable (a balance sheet account).

What is the cost of sales?,"Definition of Cost of Sales
Cost of sales is often a line shown on a manufacturer's or retailer's income statement instead of cost of goods sold.
The cost of sales for a manufacturer is the cost of its finished goods in its beginning inventory plus the cost of goods manufactured during the accounting period minus the cost of finished goods in ending inventory.
The cost of sales for a retailer is the cost of merchandise in its beginning inventory plus the net cost of merchandise purchased during the accounting period minus the cost of merchandise in its ending inventory.
The cost of sales does not include selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, or interest expense.",what
What is the difference between vertical analysis and horizontal analysis?,"Definition of Vertical Analysis
Vertical analysis expresses each amount on a financial statement as a percentage of another amount.

The vertical analysis of a balance sheet results in every balance sheet amount being restated as a percent of total assets.
The vertical analysis of an income statement results in every income statement amount being restated as a percent of net sales.

Example of Vertical Analysis of a Balance Sheet
If a company's inventory is $100,000 and its total assets are $400,000 the inventory will be expressed as 25% ($100,000 divided by $400,000). If cash is $8,000 then it will be presented as 2%($8,000 divided by $400,000). The total of the assets' percentages will add up to 100%. If the accounts payable are $88,000 they will be restated as 22% ($88,000 divided by $400,000). If owner's equity is $240,000 it will be shown as 60% ($240,000 divided by $400,000). The sum of the liabilities and owner's equity will also be 100%. The vertical analysis of the balance sheet will result in a common-size balance sheet. The percentages on a common-size balance sheet allow you to compare a small company's balance sheets to that of a very large company's balance sheet. A common-size balance sheet can also be compared to the average percentages for the industry.
Example of Vertical Analysis of an Income Statement
If a company's net sales were $1,000,000 they will be presented as 100% ($1,000,000 divided by $1,000,000). If the cost of goods sold amount is $780,000 it will be presented as 78% ($780,000 divided by sales of $1,000,000). If interest expense is $50,000 it will be presented as 5% ($50,000 divided by $1,000,000). The restated amounts result in a common-size income statement, since it can be compared to the income statement of a competitor of any size or to the industry's percentages.
Definition of Horizontal Analysis
Horizontal analysis looks at amounts from the financial statements over a horizon of many years. Horizontal analysis is also referred to as trend analysis. The amounts from past financial statements will be restated to be a percentage of the amounts from a base year. 
Examples of Horizontal Analysis
To illustrate horizontal analysis, let's assume that a base year is five years earlier. All of the amounts on the balance sheets and the income statements will be expressed as a percentage of the base year amounts. The amounts from five years earlier are presented as 100% or simply 100. The amounts from the most recent years will be divided by the base year amounts. For instance, if a most recent year amount was three times as large as the base year, the most recent year will be presented as 300. If the previous year's amount was twice the amount of the base year, it will be presented as 200. Seeing the horizontal analysis of every item allows you to more easily see the trends. It will be easy to detect that over the years the cost of goods sold has been increasing at a faster pace than the company's net sales. From the balance sheet's horizontal analysis you may see that inventory and accounts payable have been growing as a percentage of total assets.
Vertical analysis, horizontal analysis and financial ratios are part of financial statement analysis.",what
What is the difference between product costs and period costs?,"A manufacturer's product costs are the direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead used in making its products. (Manufacturing overhead is also referred to as factory overhead, indirect manufacturing costs, and burden.) The product costs of direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead are also ""inventoriable"" costs, since these are the necessary costs of manufacturing the products.
Period costs are not a necessary part of the manufacturing process. As a result, period costs cannot be assigned to the products or to the cost of inventory. The period costs are usually associated with the selling function of the business or its general administration. The period costs are reported as expenses in the accounting period in which they 1) best match with revenues, 2) when they expire, or 3) in the current accounting period. In addition to the selling and general administrative expenses, most interest expense is a period expense.",what
What is the gross margin ratio?,"Definition of Gross Margin Ratio
The gross margin ratio is a percentage resulting from dividing the amount of a company's gross profit by the amount of its net sales. (The gross margin ratio is also known as the gross profit margin or the gross profit percentage or simply the gross margin.)
Companies should be continuously monitoring its gross margin ratio to be certain it is sufficient to cover its selling, general and administrative expenses, interest expense, and to earn a profit.
Example of Gross Margin Ratio
To illustrate the gross margin ratio, let's assume that a company has net sales of $800,000 and its cost of goods sold is $600,000. As a result, its gross profit is $200,000 (net sales of $800,000 minus its cost of goods sold of $600,000) and its gross margin ratio is 25% (gross profit of $200,000 divided by net sales of $800,000).
Note: Gross margin ratios vary between industries. Therefore, you should compare a company's gross margin ratio to other companies in the same industry and to its own past ratios or its planned ratios.",what
What is the provision for bad debts?,"Definition of Provision for Bad Debts
The provision for bad debts could refer to the balance sheet account also known as the Allowance for Bad Debts, Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, or Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts. If so, the account Provision for Bad Debts is a contra asset account (an asset account with a credit balance). It is used along with the account Accounts Receivable in order for the balance sheet to report the net realizable value of the company's accounts receivable. The entry to increase the credit balance in these contra accounts is a debit to the income statement account Bad Debts Expense.
Some companies might use the description provision for bad debts on its income statement in order to report the credit losses that pertain to the period of the income statement. In that case, provision for bad debts would be an income statement account. However, the U.S. accounting textbooks are more likely to use Bad Debts Expense or Uncollectible Accounts Expense to describe the amount reported on the income statement.",what
Why is depreciation on the income statement different from the depreciation on the balance sheet?,"Definition of Depreciation
Depreciation is the systematic allocation of an asset's cost to expense over the useful life of the asset.
Example of Depreciation
Let's assume that a retailer purchased displays for its store at a cost of $120,000. The displays have a useful life of 10 years and will have no salvage value. The straight-line method of depreciation will result in depreciation of $1,000 per month ($120,000 divided by 120 months). The monthly journal entry to record the depreciation will be a debit of $1,000 to the income statement account Depreciation Expense and a credit of $1,000 to the balance sheet contra asset account Accumulated Depreciation.
Depreciation on the Income Statement
The depreciation reported on the income statement is the amount of depreciation expense that is appropriate for the period of time indicated in the heading of the income statement. 
Using our example, the monthly income statements will report $1,000 of depreciation expense. The quarterly income statements will report $3,000 of depreciation expense, and the annual income statements will report $12,000 of depreciation expense. Each month $1,000 of depreciation expense is being matched to the 120 monthly income statements during which the displays are used to generate sales revenues.
Depreciation on the Balance Sheet
The depreciation reported on the balance sheet is the accumulated or the cumulative total amount of depreciation that has been reported as depreciation expense on the income statement from the time the assets were acquired until the date of the balance sheet.
Using our example, after one month of use the accumulated depreciation for the displays will be $1,000. After 24 months of use, the accumulated depreciation reported on the balance sheet will be $24,000. After 120 months, the accumulated depreciation reported on the balance sheet will be $120,000. At that point, the depreciation will stop since the displays' cost of $120,000 has been fully depreciated. If the displays continue to be used in the 11th year, there will be no depreciation expense in the 11th year and the accumulated depreciation will continue to be $120,000.",what
What entry is made when selling a fixed asset?,"Defining the Entries When Selling a Fixed Asset
When a fixed asset or plant asset is sold, there are several things that must take place:

The fixed asset's depreciation expense must be recorded up to the date of the sale
The fixed asset's cost and the updated accumulated depreciation must be removed
The cash received must be recorded
The difference between the amounts removed in 2. and the cash received in 3. is recorded as a gain or loss on the sale of the fixed assets

Example of Entries When Selling a Plant Asset
Assume that on January 31, a company sells one of its machines that is no longer used for $3,000. Depreciation was last recorded on December 31. Also assume that the depreciation expense is $400 per month and the general ledger shows the machine's cost was $50,000 and its accumulated depreciation at December 31 was $39,600.
On January 31, the date the machine is sold, the company must record January's depreciation. This entry debits $400 to Depreciation Expense and credits $400 to Accumulated Depreciation.
Also on January 31, the company must debit Cash for $3,000 (the amount received); debit Accumulated Depreciation for $40,000 (the balance after the January 31 entry); debit Loss of Sale of Fixed Assets $7,000; and credit Machines for $50,000.
The $7,000 loss recorded on January 31 is the result of removing the machine's book value of $10,000 (cost of $50,000 minus its accumulated depreciation of $40,000), and replacing it with $3,000 of cash.
If the cash that the company received was greater than the asset's book value, the company would record the difference as a credit to Gain on Sale of Fixed of Assets.",what

What is the difference between gross margin and contribution margin?,"Definition of Gross Margin
Some use the term gross margin to mean the same as gross profit, which is: net sales minus the cost of goods sold. Others use the term gross margin to indicate the gross profit as a percentage of net sales.
The cost of goods sold will consist of both fixed and variable product costs. However, selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) are not part of the cost of goods sold. 
Definition of Contribution Margin
Contribution margin is defined as net sales minus both the variable product costs and the variable SG&A expenses. The contribution margin can also be expressed as a percentage of net sales. In that case it is often described as the contribution margin ratio.

The company's gross margin is: net sales of $600,000 minus the cost of goods sold of $320,000 = $280,000. The gross margin or gross profit percentage is: gross profit of $280,000 divided by net sales of $600,000 = 46.7%.
Example of Contribution Margin
The company's contribution margin is: net sales of $600,000 minus the variable product costs of $120,000 and the variable expenses of $40,000 = $440,000. The contribution margin ratio is 73.3% ($440,000 divided by $600,000).",what
What is miscellaneous expense?,"Definition of Miscellaneous Expense
In accounting, miscellaneous expense may refer to a general ledger account in which small, infrequent transaction amounts are recorded. The account Miscellaneous Expenses should be used as the last resort. For example, the small bank fees would be better recorded in a separate account such as Bank Service Charges instead of recording them in Miscellaneous Expenses.
Miscellaneous expense may also be the description on a company's income statement that refers to the amount consisting of small balances contained in many general ledger expense accounts.",what
What is a nominal account in accounting?,"Definintion of Nominal Account
In accounting, nominal accounts are the general ledger accounts that are closed at the end of each accounting year.
The closing process transfers their end-of-year balances from the nominal accounts to a permanent or real general ledger account. As a result, the nominal accounts are also referred to as temporary accounts. The closing process also means that each nominal account will start the next accounting year with a zero balance.
Examples of Nominal Accounts
The nominal accounts include:

All of a company's income statement accounts, and
The owner's drawing account

The income statement accounts record and report the company's revenues, expenses, gains, and losses. When the company is a sole proprietorship, the balances in these accounts will be closed by transferring the net amount into the owner's capital account. If the business is a corporation, the balances will be transferred to the retained earnings account.
Since the owner's drawing account is not an income statement account, its balance will be closed by transferring its debit balance directly into the owner's capital account.

Where does revenue received in advance go on a balance sheet?,"Definition of Revenue Received in Advance
Under the accrual basis of accounting, revenues received in advance of being earned are reported as a liability. If they will be earned within one year, they should be listed as a current liability.
When a company receives money in advance of earning it, the accounting entry is a debit to the asset Cash for the amount received and a credit to the liability account such as Customer Advances or Unearned Revenues.
As the amount received in advance is earned, the liability account should be debited for the amount earned and a revenue account should be credited. This is done through an adjusting entry.
Examples of Revenue Received in Advance
The following are a few examples of revenue received in advance:

An insurance company receiving premiums for protection during the following six months
A magazine publisher receiving money from a subscriber for magazines for the following year
A website design company receiving a client's down payment for future work
A law firm receiving a retainer fee from a new client",what
What are adjusting entries?,"Definition of Adjusting Entries
Adjusting entries are usually made on the last day of an accounting period (year, quarter, month) so that a company's financial statements comply with the accrual method of accounting. In other words, the adjusting entries are needed so that a company's:

Income statement reports the revenues that have been earned during the accounting period
Balance sheet reports the receivables that it has a right to receive as of the end of the accounting period
Income statement reports the expenses  and losses that were incurred during the accounting period
Balance sheet reports the liabilities it has incurred as of the end of the accounting period

Examples of Adjusting Entries
Here are a few examples of the need for adjusting entries:

A company shipped goods on credit, but the company's sales invoice was not processed as of the end of the accounting period
A company received some goods from a vendor but the vendor's invoice had not been processed by the company as of the end of the accounting period
A company that prepares monthly income statements paid for 6 months of insurance coverage in the first month of the insurance coverage. (This means that 5/6 of the payment is a prepaid asset and only 1/6 of the payment should be reported as an expense on each of the monthly income statements.)
A company's customer paid in advance for services to be provided over several accounting periods. Until the services are provided, the unearned amount is reported as a liability. After the services are provided, an entry is needed to reduce the liability and to report the revenues.

Note that a common characteristic of every adjusting entry will involve at least one income statement account and at least one balance sheet account.",what
"If I want a gross margin of 25%, what percent should I mark up my product?","Definition of Gross Margin
Gross margin as a percentage is the gross profit divided by the selling price. For example, if a product sells for $100 and its cost of goods sold is $75, the gross profit is $25 and the gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of the selling price) is 25% ($25/$100).
Example of Calculating the Markup on Cost to Earn a Specified Gross Margin
Since you know the cost of a product and you know the gross margin percentage to be achieved, you can determine the selling price and the markup needed.
Let's begin by assuming that a company's product has a cost of $75 and the company desires a 25% gross margin (or 25% of the selling price). Let's use ""SP"" to indicate the product's required selling price and ""MU$"" to represent the gross profit, and state the gross margin as 0.25SP. This means that:

SP = Cost + MU$
SP = $75 + MU$
Since MU$ must be 25% of SP, we can state: SP = $75 + 0.25SP
Restating the previous point, we have: SP - 0.25SP = $75
Restating the previous point, we have: 0.75SP = $75
After dividing each side of the equation by 0.75, we have: SP = $100

With a selling price of $100 and a cost of $75, the  $25 markup as a percentage of the $75 cost is 33.33% ($25/$75). The gross profit of $25 ($100 - $75) also means a gross margin of 25% ($25 gross profit divided by the selling price of $100).",what
How do you record a payment for insurance?,"Definition of Payment for Insurance
A company's property insurance, liability insurance, business interruption insurance, etc. often covers a one-year period with the cost (insurance premiums) paid in advance. The one-year period for the insurance rarely coincides with the company's accounting year. Therefore, the insurance payments will likely involve more than one annual financial statement and many interim financial statements. 
Prepaid Insurance vs. Insurance Expense
When the insurance premiums are paid in advance, they are referred to as prepaid. At the end of any accounting period, the amount of the insurance premiums that remain prepaid should be reported in the current asset account, Prepaid Insurance. The prepaid amount will be reported on the balance sheet after inventory and could part of an item described as prepaid expenses.
As the prepaid amount expires, the balance in Prepaid Insurance is reduced by a credit to Prepaid Insurance and a debit to Insurance Expense. This is done with an adjusting entry at the end of each accounting period (e.g. monthly). One objective of the adjusting entry is to match the proper amount of insurance expense to the period indicated on the income statement.
Example of Payment for Insurance Expense
Let's assume that a company is started on December 1 and arranges for business insurance to begin on December 1. On December 1 the company pays the insurance company $12,000 for the insurance premiums covering one year. The company will record the payment with a debit of $12,000 to Prepaid Insurance and a credit of $12,000 to Cash.
On December 31, the company writes an adjusting entry to record the insurance expense that was used up (expired) and to reduce the amount that remains prepaid. This is accomplished with a debit of $1,000 to Insurance Expense and a credit of $1,000 to Prepaid Insurance. This same adjusting entry will be prepared at the end of each of the next 11 months.",what
How are the balance sheet and income statement connected?,"Connection between Balance Sheet and Income Statement
The connection between the balance sheet and the income statement results from:

The use of double-entry accounting or bookkeeping, and
 The accounting equation Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity

Basically, the income statement components have the following effects on owner's equity:

Revenues and gains cause owner's (or stockholders') equity to increase
Expenses and losses cause owner's (or stockholders') equity to decrease

Example of How the Balance Sheet and Income Statement Are Connected
To illustrate the connection between the balance sheet and income statement, let's assume that a company's owner's equity was $40,000 at the beginning of the year, and it was $65,000 at the end of the year. Let's also assume that the owner did not invest or withdraw business assets during the year. Therefore, the $25,000 increase in owner's equity is likely the company's net income earned for the year. The details for the $25,000 (revenues, expenses, gains, losses) will be reported on the company's income statement for the year.
Accountants refer to the income statement accounts (revenues, expenses, gains, losses) as temporary accounts because their balances will be closed and transferred to the owner's capital account at the end of the year.",what
What is bad debts expense?,"Definition of Bad Debts Expense
Bad debts expense is related to a company's current asset accounts receivable. Bad debts expense is also referred to as uncollectible accounts expense or doubtful accounts expense. Bad debts expense results because a company delivered goods or services on credit and the customer did not pay the amount owed.
Examples of Bad Debts Expense
There are two methods for reporting the amount of bad debts expense:

direct write-off method
allowance method

The direct write-off method requires that a customer's uncollectible account be removed from Accounts Receivable and at that time the following entry is made: debit Bad Debts Expense and credit Accounts Receivable.
The allowance method  anticipates and estimates that some of the accounts receivable will not be collected. In other words, prior to knowing exactly which customers or clients will not be paying, the company will debit Bad Debts Expense and will credit Allowance for Doubtful Accounts for the estimated amount. (The Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is a contra asset account that when presented along with Accounts Receivable indicates a more realistic amount that will be turning to cash.)
For financial statement purposes the allowance method is the better method since 1) the balance sheet will be reporting a more realistic amount that will be collected from the company's accounts receivable, and 2) the bad debts expense will be reported on the income statement closer to the time of the related credit sales. However, for income tax purposes the direct write-off method must be used.",what
What is depreciation expense?,"Definition of Depreciation Expense
Depreciation expense is the appropriate portion of a company's fixed asset's cost that is being used up during the accounting period shown in the heading of the company's income statement.
Example of Depreciation Expense
To illustrate depreciation expense, assume that a company had paid $480,000 for its office building (excluding land) and the building has an estimated useful life of 40 years (480 months) with no salvage value. Using the straight-line method of depreciation, the  depreciation expense to be reported on each of the company's monthly income statements is $1,000 ($480,000 divided by 480 months).
Additional Information
Depreciation expense is referred to as a noncash expense because the recurring, monthly depreciation entry (a debit to Depreciation Expense and a credit to Accumulated Depreciation) does not involve a cash payment. As a result, the statement of cash flows prepared under the indirect method will add depreciation expense to the amount of net income.
Methods for computing depreciation expense other than straight-line include double-declining balance, sum-of-the-years digits, and units of production or activity.",what
Is income tax an expense or liability?,"Definition of Income Tax
In the accounting for a regular U.S. corporation, income tax usually refers to the federal, state, local, and foreign countries' taxes that are levied based on a corporation's taxable income. The taxable income and the related income tax are found on the corporation's income tax return. (The corporation's taxable income is based on the income tax laws and regulations of the various governments.)
The accounting and financial reporting of a regular corporation's income taxes is complicated because the accounting principles are likely to be different from the income tax laws and regulations. Generally, a profitable regular corporation's financial statements will report both income tax expense and a current liability such as income taxes payable.
Examples of Income Tax Expense and Income Taxes Payable
A profitable corporation's financial statements will report:

Income tax expense on its income statement for the revenues and expenses appearing on the accounting period's income statement, and
Income taxes payable (a current liability on the balance sheet) for the amount of income taxes owed to the various governments as of the date of the balance sheet

If a corporation has overpaid its income taxes and is entitled to a refund, the amount will be reported on the balance sheet as a current asset such as Other receivables.
If there are differences between the time when certain revenues and expenses are reported on the income tax returns versus when they are reported on the financial statements, the amount of the deferred income tax will likely be reported on the balance sheet as a noncurrent liability as Deferred income taxes.",what
What is the difference between gross profit and net profit?,"Definition of Gross Profit
Gross profit is defined as net sales minus the cost of goods sold.
Example of Gross Profit
Assume that a retailer had gross sales of $220,000 and sales returns and allowances of $20,000 during a recent year. Also assume that its cost of goods sold during the year amounted to $140,000. With these assumptions, the retailer's gross profit calculation is: net sales of $200,000 ($220,000 minus $20,000) minus its cost of goods sold of $140,000 = gross profit of $60,000. 
Definition of Net Profit
The term net profit might have a variety of definitions. We will assume that net profit means a company's net sales minus all expenses. The expenses include the cost of goods sold, the selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses, and the nonoperating expenses and losses. Nonoperating revenues and gains would be an increase to the net profit. If the business is a regular corporation, net profit may mean after income tax expense.
Example of Net Profit
Assume that a sole proprietorship business had the following information for it most recent year:

net sales of $200,000
cost of goods sold of $140,000
selling, general and administrative expenses of $45,000
interest expense of $5,000

The company's net profit was $10,000. The calculation is $200,000 minus $140,000 = gross profit of $60,000 minus $45,000 of SG&A expenses and $5,000 of interest expense = $10,000.",what
What are operating expenses?,"Definition of Operating Expenses
Operating expenses are the costs that have been used up (expired) as part of a company's main operating activities during the period shown in the heading of its income statement.
Examples of Operating Activities
Examples of a retailer's main operating activities involve the buying and selling of merchandise or goods. Therefore, the retailer's income statement will report the following operating expenses:

Cost of goods sold. These costs are reported as operating expenses on the income statement because of the matching principle: The cost of the merchandise that is sold is being matched with the revenues from selling the goods.
Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A). These costs are reported as operating expenses on the income statement because they pertain to operating the main business during that accounting period. These costs are expenses because they may have expired, may have been used up, or may not have a future value that can be measured.

Some authors define operating expenses as only SG&A. In other words, they do not include the cost of goods sold as an operating expense. Such a definition will be deficient when measuring a company's operating income. Clearly, the calculation of operating income cannot omit the cost of goods sold.",what
What is the difference between a nominal account and a real account?,"Definition of Nominal Account
The balance in a nominal account is closed at the end of the accounting year. As a result, a nominal account begins each accounting year with a zero balance. Since the balance does not carry forward to the next accounting year, a nominal account is also referred to as a temporary account.
Examples of Nominal Accounts
The nominal accounts are almost always the income statement accounts such as the accounts for recording revenues, expenses, gains, and losses. When the income statement accounts are closed at the end of the accounting year, the net amount will ultimately end up in a balance sheet equity account such as the proprietor's capital account or the corporation's retained earnings account.
Definition of Real Account
The balance in a real account is not closed at the end of the accounting year. As a result, a real account begins each accounting year with its balance from the end of the previous year. Because the end-of-the-year balance is carried forward to the next accounting year, a real account is also known as a permanent account.
Examples of Real Accounts
The real accounts are the balance sheet accounts such as the accounts for recording assets, liabilities, and the owner's (or stockholders') equity. However, the sole proprietor's drawing account, which is reported on the balance sheet during the year, is a temporary account because it is closed directly to the owner's capital account at the end of the year.",what
"What is the difference between revenue, income, and gain?","Definition of Revenue
Revenue is the amount earned from a company's main operating activities, such as a retailer selling merchandise or a law firm providing legal services.
Definition of Gain
In accounting, a gain is the result of a peripheral activity, such as a retailer selling one of its old delivery trucks. A gain occurs when the cash amount (or its equivalent) received is greater than the asset's carrying amount, which is also referred to as the asset's book value. For example, if the company receives $3,000 for the old delivery truck, and the truck's carry amount (book value) at the time of the sale was $600, the company will have a gain of $2,400.
Definition of Income
Non-accountants might use the term income instead of the word revenue. Generally, accountants use the term income to mean ""net of revenues and expenses."" For example, a retailer's income from operations is its net sales minus the cost of goods sold minus its selling, general and administrative expenses.",what
Is a loan's principal payment included on the income statement?,"Definition of Loan Principal Payment
When a company borrows money from its bank, the amount received is recorded with a debit to Cash and a credit to a liability account, such as Notes Payable or Loans Payable, which is reported on the company's balance sheet. The cash received from the bank loan is referred to as the principal amount.
The principal amount received from the bank is not part of a company's revenues and therefore will not be reported on the company's income statement. Similarly, any repayment of the principal amount will not be an expense and therefore will not be reported on the income statement. The principal payment is recorded as a reduction of the liability Notes Payable or Loans Payable. (Both the receipt of the loan principal amount and the repayment of the loan principal will be reported on the statement of cash flows.) The interest on the loan will be reported as expense on the income statement in the periods when the interest is incurred.
Example of a Loan Principal Payment
Let's assume that a company borrows $10,000 from its bank. The company's cash increases by $10,000 and its liability Loans Payable increases by $10,000. Let's also assume that the company makes a payment of $1,000 consisting of $60 for interest and $940 for principal, the entry will be:

Debit of $60 to Interest Expense (an income statement account)
Debit of $940 to Loans Payable (a balance sheet account)
Credit of $1,000 to Cash (a balance sheet account)

Notice that only the interest expense of $60 will be included on the income statement.",what
How do you report a write-down in inventory?,"Definition of Write-down in Inventory
Under FIFO and average cost methods, when the net realizable value of inventory is less than the cost of the inventory, there needs to be a reduction in the inventory amount. Often the balance in the current asset account Inventory is reduced through a credit to a contra inventory account, which is referred to as a valuation account. The debit in the entry to write down inventory is recorded in an account such as Loss on Write-Down of Inventory, which is an income statement account.
Example of Reporting a Write-down in Inventory
Under FIFO and average cost methods, if the net realizable value is less than the inventory's cost, the balance sheet must report the lower amount. If the amount of the Loss on Write-Down of Inventory is relatively small, it can be reported on the income statement as part of the cost of goods sold. If the amount of the Loss on Write-Down of Inventory is significant, it should be reported as a separate line on the income statement.
Since the amount of the write-down of inventory reduces net income, it will also reduce the amount reported on the balance sheet for owner's equity or stockholders' equity. Thus, the balance sheet and the accounting equation will show a reduction in inventory and in owner's or stockholders' equity.",what
What is an expense?,"Definition of Expense
Under the accrual method of accounting, an expense is a cost that is reported on the income statement for the period in which:

The cost best matches the related revenues
The cost is used up or expires
There is uncertainty or difficulty in measuring the future benefit of the cost

Examples of Expense
Some of the expenses that will be reported on a retailer's income statement for the month of August include:

Cost of goods sold for the August sales. (The date that the retailer had paid for the goods is not pertinent.)
Commissions earned by the sales staff for having sold the goods in August (even if the commissions are paid in September)
Cost of the electricity used in August (even if the bill is received in September and is paid in October)
August rent for the store
Wages that employees earned in August
Advertising that took place in August

Expenses are often divided into two major classifications:

Operating expenses which involve a company's main activities. A retailer's operating expenses include the cost of goods sold and its selling, general and administrative expenses. Inside the company, these will likely be sorted by department, product line, and so on.
Nonoperating expenses which pertain to a company's incidental activities. A common nonoperating expense for a retailer is interest expense.",what
What is SG&A?,"Definition of SG&A
SG&A is the acronym for selling, general and administrative. SG&A are the operating expenses incurred to 1) promote, sell, and deliver a company's products and services, and 2) manage the overall company.
SG&A will be reported on the income statement in the period in which the expenses occur. Hence, SG&A expenses are said to be period costs as opposed to being part of a product's cost. Since SG&A expenses are not a product cost, they are not assigned to the cost of goods sold or to the goods that are in inventory. 
Examples of SG&A
SG&A expenses include sales commissions, advertising, promotional materials, compensation of the company's officers as well as the marketing, sales, finance and office staffs, rent, utilities, supplies, computers, etc. provided they are outside of the manufacturing operations.
SG&A will not include interest expense since interest expense is reported as a nonoperating expense.",what
What is the monthly close?,"Definition of Monthly Close
In accounting, monthly close is a series of steps and procedures that are followed so that a company's monthly financial statements are in compliance with the accrual method of accounting.
Since a company's business activities are ongoing, accountants might state ""we need to get a proper ""cut-off"" between the end-of-the-month transactions and those that belong in the following month.
If a company sells goods and has inventories, its monthly close will be more challenging. The company must be certain that the costs of the goods purchased are recorded in the same month as the goods are added to the inventories.
Reviewing the financial statements before they are distributed is also an important step in the monthly close. This could mean comparing the amounts and percentages on the current financial statements to those of earlier months. For example, if the current income statement shows the cost of goods sold as 86% instead of the normal 81%, the current month's amounts should be investigated before releasing the financial statements.",what
What is the difference between accounts payable and accrued expenses payable?,"Definition of Accounts Payable
Accounts Payable is a liability account in which suppliers' or vendors' approved invoices are recorded. As a result, the balance in Accounts Payable should be a precise amount.
Definition of Accrued Expenses Payable
Accrued Expenses Payable is a liability account that records amounts that are owed, but the vendors' invoices have not yet been received and/or have not yet been recorded in Accounts Payable as of the end of the accounting period. The amounts in this account are usually recorded with accrual adjusting entries made at the end of the accounting period.
Examples of Accrued Expenses Payable
In addition to the amounts associated with vendors' invoices, accrued expenses may also include wages, interest, utilities, and other expenses that were incurred and owed, but not yet recorded in the general ledger accounts. Some of the amounts recorded in Accrued Expenses Payable may be estimated amounts that should supported by reasonable and documented calculations.

What is a contra revenue account?,"Definition of Contra Revenue Account
A contra revenue account is a revenue account that is expected to have a debit balance (instead of the usual credit balance). In other words, its expected balance is contrary to—or opposite of—the usual credit balance in a revenue account.
A contra revenue account allows a company to see the original amount sold and to also see the items that reduced the sales to the amount of net sales.
Examples of Contra Revenue Accounts
Two examples of contra revenue accounts are:

Sales Returns and Allowances
Sales Discounts

To illustrate the contra revenue account Sales Returns and Allowances, let's assume that Company K sells $100,000 of merchandise on credit. It will debit Accounts Receivable for $100,000 and credit to Sales for $100,000. If a customer returns $500 of this merchandise, Company K will debit Sales Returns and Allowances for $500 and will credit Accounts Receivable for $500. Company K's income statement will report the gross Sales of $100,000 minus the sales returns and allowances of $500 and the resulting net sales of $99,500.
If a company offers an early payment discount (such as 1% or 2% of the invoice amount if it is paid within 10 days instead of the required 30 days) the amount of the discount is recorded in the contra revenue account Sales Discounts. Again, the company's management will see the original amount of sales, the sales discounts, and the resulting net sales.",what
What is gross profit?,"Definition of Gross Profit
Gross profit is defined as net sales minus the cost of goods sold.
Gross profit is sometimes referred to as gross margin. (However, gross margin can also mean the gross profit expressed as a percentage of net sales.)
Gross profit is presented on a multiple-step income statement prior to deducting selling, general and administrative expenses and prior to nonoperating revenues, nonoperating expenses, gains and losses.
Example of Gross Profit
Let's assume that a manufacturer has net sales of $60,000 and its cost of goods sold (using absorption costing) is $39,000. Therefore, the manufacturer's gross profit is $21,000 ($60,000 minus $39,000). The gross profit ratio or gross profit percentage is 35% (gross profit of $21,000 divided by net sales of $60,000).",what
How do you calculate the gain or loss when an asset is sold?,"Definition of Gain or Loss on Sale of an Asset
The gain or loss on the sale of an asset used in a business is the difference between 1) the amount of cash that a company receives, and 2) the asset's book value (carrying value) at the time of the sale.
In order to know the asset's book value at the time of the sale, the depreciation expense for the asset must be recorded right up to the date that the asset is sold.
If the cash received is greater than the asset's book value, the difference is recorded as a gain. If the cash received is less than the asset's book value, the difference is recorded as a loss.
Example of a Gain on the Sale of an Asset
On March 31, a company sells its old delivery van for $4,000. The van's original cost was $45,000 and its accumulated depreciation was $43,600 as of the date of the sale. Therefore, the van's book value as of March 31 was $1,400 (cost of $45,000 minus accumulated depreciation of $43,600). Since the $4,000 of cash received by the company was greater than the van's book value of $1,400, there is a gain on the sale of the van of $2,600 ($4,000 minus $1,400).
The gain could also be determined by preparing the journal entry for the transaction:

Debit Cash for $4,000
Debit Accumulated Depreciation for $43,600 (to remove the credit balance)
Credit Delivery Van for $45,000 (to remove the original cost)
Credit Gain on Sale of Van for $2,600 (needed to balance the entry)

The credit of $2,600 will result in the entry having debits of $47,600 and credits of $47,600.",what
What is materiality?,"Definition of Materiality
In accounting, materiality refers to the relative size of an amount. Relatively large amounts are material, while relatively small amounts are not material (or immaterial). Determining materiality requires professional judgement. For instance, a $20,000 amount will likely be immaterial for a large corporation with a net income of $900,000. However, the same $20,000 amount will be material for a small corporation with a net income of $40,000.
Another view of materiality is whether sophisticated investors would be misled if the amount was omitted or misclassified. If sophisticated investors would be misled or would have made a different decision, the amount is considered to be material. If sophisticated investors would not be misled or would not have made a different decision, the amount is judged to be immaterial. 
Example of Materiality
A classic example of the materiality concept is a company expensing a $20 wastebasket in the year it is acquired instead of depreciating it over its useful life of 10 years. The matching principle directs you to record the wastebasket as an asset and then report depreciation expense of $2 a year for 10 years. Materiality allows you to expense the entire $20 cost in the year it is acquired. The reason is that no investor, creditor, or other interested party would be misled by immediately expensing the $20 wastebasket.
Materiality also justifies large corporations having a policy of immediately expensing assets having a cost of less than $2,500 instead of setting up fixed asset records and depreciating those assets over their useful lives.",what
What is the difference between cost and expense?,"Definition of Cost
A cost might be an expense or it might be an asset. 
Definition of Expense
An expense is a cost that has expired or was necessary in order to earn revenues. The matching principle guides accountants as to when a cost will be reported as an expense. 
Example of a Cost
A company's property insurance bill for the next six months of insurance shows a cost of $6,000. Initially the cost of $6,000 is reported as the current asset Prepaid Insurance (or Prepaid Expense) since the cost has not been used up (has not expired).
Example of an Expense
As a prepaid cost such as the $6,000 in the asset account Prepaid Insurance expires, the part that expires will be reported on the income statement as Insurance Expense. If the insurance cost is expiring at a rate of $1,000 per month, then each month the amount in the asset account Prepaid Insurance will decrease by $1,000 and Insurance Expense of $1,000 will be reported on the income statement.",what
How is the account Cash Short and Over used?,"Definition of Cash Short and Over Account
The account Cash Short and Over is an income statement account (within a company's general ledger) in which shortages or overages of cash are recorded. The Cash Short and Over account might be used by:

A bank to record daily differences (if any) between a teller's actual cash at the end of the day versus the expected amount of cash based on checks cashed, deposits received, etc.
A company to record unexplained differences arising when a company's petty cash fund is replenished

The account Cash Short and Over provides a way to monitor employees' cash handling proficiency.
Generally, the amounts in the account Cash Short and Over are so small that the account balance will be included with other insignificant amounts reported on the income statement as Other Expenses.
Example of How the Account Cash Short and Over is Used
Let's illustrate the Cash Short and Over account with the petty cash fund. Assume that the company has a petty cash fund of $100 and its general ledger account Petty Cash reports an imprest balance of $100. Let's now assume that when the petty cash fund is replenished, there is $6.00 on hand and there are $93.00 of petty cash vouchers. This indicates a shortage of $1.00.
Using the above information, the journal entry to replenish the petty cash fund will include a credit of $94.00 to the account Cash: Checking Account. (This is the amount of the company check that will be cashed to get the cash in the petty cash fund back to the imprest general ledger amount of $100.) The debits will be the accounts and amounts shown on the petty cash receipts, which total $93. To get the journal entry to balance, a debit of $1 is recorded in Cash Short and Over.",what
What is a temporary account?,"Definition of Temporary Account
A temporary account is a general ledger account that begins each accounting year with a zero balance. Then at the end of the year its account balance is removed by transferring the amount to another account. This is done through closing entries. Temporary accounts are also referred to as nominal accounts.
All of the income statement accounts are classified as temporary accounts. A few other accounts such as the owner's drawing account and the income summary account are also temporary accounts. 
Examples of Temporary Accounts
Temporary accounts include all of the various groups of income statement accounts:

Revenues
Expenses
Gains
Losses

Having temporary income statement accounts makes for easy reporting of each year's details. After the amounts for the year have been reported on the income statement, the balances in the temporary accounts will end up in a permanent account such as a corporation's retained earnings account or in a sole proprietor's capital account. (In a manual system, the balances in the income statement accounts will first be closed to an income summary account. Next, the income summary balance will be transferred to the corporation's retained earnings or to the sole proprietor's capital account.)
A temporary account that is not an income statement account is the proprietor's drawing account. The balance in the drawing account is transferred directly to the owner's capital account and will not be reported on the income statement or in an income summary account.",what
What is the difference between gross profit margin and gross margin?,"Definition of Gross Profit
Gross profit is an amount that is computed as follows:

A company's net Sales minus its cost of goods sold
A product's selling price minus the product's cost

Gross profit is the amount before deducting the following expenses: selling, general, administrative, interest, and income tax.
Definition of Gross Profit Margin
Gross profit margin is also referred to as the gross profit percentage or gross margin ratio. In that situation the calculation is:

A company's gross profit divided by the company's net sales
A product's gross profit margin divided by the product's selling price

Definition of Gross Margin
Some use the term gross margin to mean exactly the same as gross profit. Perhaps they want to avoid the word profit  since the selling, general, administrative, and interest expense have not yet been considered.
Others will use the term gross margin to mean the gross profit margin or gross profit percentage or gross margin ratio.
Example of Gross Profit, Gross Profit Margin and Gross Margin
Assume that in its most recent year a company had net sales of $80,000 and cost of goods sold of $60,000. As a result, the company had a gross profit of $20,000 ($80,000 minus $60,000) and a gross profit margin of 25% ($20,000 divided by $80,000). Some people will say the company had a gross margin of $20,000 while others will say the company had a gross margin of 25%. Others might say the company had a gross margin ratio of 25%.",what
What are income statement accounts?,"Definition of Income Statement Accounts
Income statement accounts are one of two types of general ledger accounts. (The other accounts in the general ledger are the balance sheet accounts.)
Income statement accounts are used to sort and store transactions involving:

Operating revenues
Operating expenses
Non-operating revenues and gains
Non-operating expenses and losses

Large companies may have thousands of income statement accounts in order to budget and report revenues and expenses by divisions, product lines, departments, and so on. 
Income statement accounts are also referred to as temporary accounts or nominal accounts because at the end of each accounting year their balances will be closed. This means that the balances in the income statement accounts will be combined and the net amount transferred to a balance sheet equity account. In the case of a corporation, the equity account is Retained Earnings. In the case of a sole proprietorship, the equity account is the owner's capital account. As a result, the income statement accounts will begin the next accounting year with zero balances.
Examples of Income Statement Accounts
A few of the many income statement accounts used in a business include Sales, Sales Returns and Allowances, Service Revenues, Cost of Goods Sold, Salaries Expense, Wages Expense, Fringe Benefits Expense, Rent Expense, Utilities Expense, Advertising Expense, Automobile Expense, Depreciation Expense, Interest Expense, Gain on Disposal of Truck, and many more.",what
What is interest expense?,"Definition of Interest Expense
Interest expense is the cost of borrowing money during a specified period of time. Interest expense is occurring daily, but the interest is likely to be paid monthly, quarterly, semiannually, or annually.
Example of Interest Expense
Let's assume that a company uses the accrual basis of accounting. If the company borrows $100,000 on December 15 and agrees to pay interest on the 15th day of each month at the rate of 1% per month, the interest expense for the month of December will be approximately $500 ($100,000 x 1% x 1/2 month). The interest expense for the month of January will be $1,000 ($100,000 x 1%).
In this example, as of December 31 no interest has been paid on the loan that began on December 15. However, the company did incur one-half month of interest expense. Therefore, the company needs to record an accrual adjusting entry that debits Interest Expense for $500, and credits Interest Payable for $500.",what
Where is a contingent liability recorded?,"Recording a Contingent Liability
A potential or contingent liability that is both probable and the amount can be estimated is recorded as 1) an expense or loss on the income statement, and 2) a liability on the balance sheet. 
Disclosing a Contingent Liability
A loss contingency which is possible but not probable will not be recorded in the accounts as a liability and a loss. Rather, it will be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
A loss contingency that is probable or possible but the amount cannot be estimated means the amount cannot be recorded in the company's accounts or reported as liability on the balance sheet. Instead, the contingent liability will be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. 
Not Reporting or Disclosing a Contingent Liability
A loss contingency that is remote  will not be recorded and it will not have to be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. An example is a nuisance lawsuit where there is no similar case that was ever successful.
Example of Recording a Contingent Liability
Product warranties are often cited as a contingent liability that meets both of the required conditions (probable and the amount can be estimated). Product warranties will be recorded at the time of the products' sales by debiting Warranty Expense and crediting to Warranty Liability for the estimated amount.",what
What is a trade discount?,"Definition of Trade Discount
A trade discount is a routine reduction from the regular, established price of a product. The use of trade discounts allows a company to vary the final price based on each customer's volume or status.
Note that trade discounts are different from early-payment discounts. (Early-payment discounts of 1% or 2% are usually recorded by the seller in an account such as Sales Discounts and by the buyer using the periodic inventory method in an account such as Purchase Discounts.) Trade discounts are not recorded in a separate account by either the seller or the buyer.
Example of Trade Discounts
A distributor of merchandise may have a single catalog which displays a single price for each product. However, the distributor allows a trade discount from the catalog price based on each customer's volume. For example, one product may have a catalog price of $100. A casual buyer will be charged $100. However, a reseller will be given a trade discount of 20% from the catalog price, and will be charged $80. Lastly, a registered high-volume wholesaler will be given a trade discount of 27% and will be charged $73.
Recording Sales Having a Trade Discount
The company selling the product (and the buyer of the product) will record the transaction at the amount after the trade discount is subtracted. For example, when goods with list prices totaling $1,000 are sold to a wholesaler that is entitled to a 27% trade discount, both the seller and the buyer will record the transaction at $730. There will not be a general ledger account entitled Trade Discount.",what
What is revenue?,"Definition of Revenue
Revenue is the amount a company receives from selling goods and/or providing services to its customers and clients. A company's revenue, which is reported on the first line of its income statement, is often described as sales or service revenues. Hence, revenue is the amount earned from customers and clients before subtracting the company's expenses. 
Revenue vs Net Income
While revenue is the top line on a company's income statement, net income is often referred to as the bottom line.
The difference between the amount of revenue and the amount of net income is significant. Here are some hypothetical amounts to illustrate the point:

Revenue from sales of products $300,000
Cost of the products that were sold $200,000
Expenses (wages, rent, ads, etc.) $88,000
Net income (before tax) $12,000

Using the above amounts we see that the company's net income was only 4% of its revenue ($12,000/$300,000). 
Calculating Revenue
The best way to calculate a company's revenue during an accounting period (year, month, etc.) is to sum up the amounts earned (as opposed to the amounts of cash that were received). For example, if a new company sold $75,000 of goods in December but allows the customer to pay 30 days later, the company's December sales are $75,000 (even though no cash was received in December). Reporting revenues in the period in which they are earned is known as the accrual basis of accounting. Hence, a company's revenue could occur before the cash is received, after the cash is received, or at time that the cash is received.
(Note that for income tax reporting, smaller companies may use the cash basis of accounting.)
Examples of Revenue
Common examples of revenue include:

A retailer's sales of merchandise, sales of extended warranties, and repair revenues
The fees earned by a law firm for legal services provided to clients
The amounts earned by publishers of magazines, newspapers, and electronic information

Revenue vs Income
It is important to note that many people use the term income to mean revenue. Perhaps a business owner sees money ""coming in"" from customers and logically refers to it as ""income"". However, it is best to use the word sales or revenue when referring to the amounts earned from customers, and to use the word income for an amount that reflects the subtraction of expenses.",what
Is the cost of goods sold an expense?,"Why the Cost of Goods Sold is an Expense
We often think of expenses as salaries, advertising, rent, commissions, interest, and so on. However, the cost of goods sold is also an expense that must be matched with the related sales. Hence, a company's operating income is its operating revenues minus the cost of goods sold and its sales, general and administrative expenses.
The FASB's Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No. 6, Elements of Financial Statements, paragraph 81, states that ""...expenses themselves are in many forms and are called by various names—for example, cost of goods sold, cost of services provided, depreciation, interest, salaries and wages...."" You can read the concepts statements at www.FASB.org/st.",what
Is the provision for doubtful debts an operating expense?,"Definition of Provision for Doubtful Debts
Some companies use Provision for Doubtful Debts as the name of the contra-asset account which is reported on the company's balance sheet. Other companies use Provision for Doubtful Debts as the name for the current period's expense that is reported on the company's income statement.
If Provision for Doubtful Debts is the name of the account used for recording the current period's expense associated with the losses from normal credit sales, it will appear as an operating expense on the company's income statement. It may be included in the company's selling, general and administrative expenses.
[However, if the expense is associated with extending credit outside of a company's main selling activities, the credit loss will be reported as a nonoperating expense.]
Example of Provision for Doubtful Debts
Accounting textbooks avoid the use of the word ""provision"" and instead use the following terminology:

The contra-asset account associated with accounts receivable will have the account title Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.
The current period expense pertaining to accounts receivable (and its contra account) is recorded in the account Bad Debts Expense which is reported on the income statement as part of the operating expenses.",what
What is accrued interest?,"Definition of Accrued Interest
Accrued interest is the amount of loan interest that has already occurred, but has not yet been paid by the borrower and not yet received by the lender.
Under the accrual basis of accounting, the amount of accrued interest is to be recorded with accrual adjusting entries by the borrower and the lender before issuing their financial statements.
The borrower's adjusting entry will debit Interest Expense and credit Accrued Interest Payable (a current liability). The lender's adjusting entry will debit Accrued Interest Receivable (a current asset) and credit Interest Revenue (or Income).
Example of Accrued Interest
Let's assume that on December 16, a company borrows $20,000 from its bank at an annual interest rate of 6%. The first interest payment is due 30 days later on January 15. Both the company and the bank have accounting years which end on December 31.
The accrued interest as of December 31 is $50 ($20,000 X 6% = $1,200 per year = $100 per month = $50 for 1/2 month).
The company's adjusting entry will debit Interest Expense for $50, and will credit Accrued Interest Payable for $50.
The bank's adjusting entry will debit Accrued Interest Receivable for $50, and will credit Interest Revenue for $50.",what
Where does the purchase of equipment show up on a profit and loss statement?,"Reporting the Purchase of Equipment
Assuming that the purchase of equipment is a long-term or noncurrent asset that will be used in a business, the purchase will not  be reported on the profit and loss statement (income statement, statement of earnings). Rather, the equipment's cost will be reported in the general ledger account Equipment, which is reported on the balance sheet under the classification Property, plant and equipment. The purchase will also be included in the company's capital expenditures that are reported on the statement of cash flows in the section entitled cash flows from investing activities.
When the equipment is placed into service, the company will begin to report depreciation expense on the profit and loss statements during the years that the equipment is used.
Example of Equipment's Cost on Income Statement
Let's assume that a company buys equipment for $100,000 and it is expected to be used for 10 years with no salvage value at the end of its useful life. Using the straight-line method of depreciation, each year's profit and loss statement will report depreciation expense of $10,000 for 10 years. Each year the account Accumulated Depreciation will be credited for the $10,000 of annual depreciation.",what
Where should I enter unpaid wages?,"Definition of Unpaid Wages
Unpaid wages are usually the amounts that hourly-paid employees have earned, but have not yet been paid to the employees. 
Entering Unpaid Wages
Under the accrual basis of accounting, unpaid wages that have been earned by employees but have not yet been recorded in the accounting records should be entered or recorded through an accrual adjusting entry which will:

Debit Wages Expense
Credit Wages Payable or credit Accrued Wages Payable

Wages Expense is an income statement account. Wages Payable or Accrued Wages Payable is a current liability account that is reported on the balance sheet.",what
Would you please explain unearned income?,"Definition of Unearned Income
Unearned income or deferred income is a receipt of money before it has been earned. This is also referred to as deferred revenues or customer deposits. The unearned amount is initially recorded in a liability account such as Deferred Income, Deferred Revenues, or Customer Deposits. As the amount is earned, the liability account is reduced and the amount earned will be reported on the income statement as revenues.
Example #1 of Unearned Income
A lawn service company offers customers a special package of five applications of fertilizers and weed treatments for $300. However, the customer must prepay in December for the five treatments that will be done between April and September. When the company receives the $300 in December, it will debit the asset Cash for $300 and will credit the liability account Unearned Revenues. Since these are balance sheet accounts (and since no work has yet been performed), there are no revenues to be reported in December. In April when the first service is provided, the company will debit the liability account Unearned Revenues for $60 and will credit the income statement account Service Revenues for $60. At the end of April, the balance sheet will report the company's remaining liability of $240. The income statement for April will report the $60 that was earned. The $60 entry is referred to as an adjusting entry and the same entry will be recorded when each of the remaining four treatments are provided.
Example #2 of Unearned Income
A company informs a new customer that a $5,000 deposit is required before it will begin work on the customer's special order. The customer gives the company $5,000 on December 28 and the company will begin work on the special order on January 3. On December 28 the company will debit Cash for $5,000 and will credit a liability account, such as Customer Deposits (or Unearned Revenues or Deferred Revenues) for $5,000. No revenue is reported in December for this special order since the company did not perform any work in December. When the special order begins and is completed in January, the company will debit the liability account for $5,000 and will credit a revenue account.",what
What is inventory change and how is it measured?,"Definition of Inventory Change
Inventory change is the difference between the amount of last period's ending inventory and the amount of the current period's ending inventory.
Under the periodic inventory system, there may also be an income statement account with the title Inventory Change or with the title (Increase) Decrease in Inventory. This account is presented as an adjustment to purchases in determining the company's cost of goods sold. 
Example of Inventory Change
Let's assume that last year's ending inventory was $100,000 and the current year's ending inventory is $115,000. Under the periodic inventory system, this inventory increase of $15,000 could be recorded as a debit of $15,000 to Inventory (thereby increasing the account balance from $100,000 to $115,000, and as a credit of $15,000 to Inventory Change.
Next, assume that the company's net purchases for the year amounted to a net debit of $300,000. This $300,000 debit and the credit of $15,000 in Inventory Change results in the cost of goods sold of $285,000. The logic is that not all $300,000 of net purchases should be matched against sales since $15,000 of the purchases were added to inventory. (This is an alternative to the method used in introductory accounting textbooks, which is: beginning inventory of $100,000 + net purchases of $300,000 = $400,000 of cost of goods available – ending inventory of $115,000 = cost of goods sold of $285,000.)
Alternatively, if last year's ending inventory was $100,000 and the current year's ending inventory is $93,000, there will be a credit to Inventory for $7,000 and a debit to Inventory Change for $7,000. When the debit of $7,000 in the Inventory Change account is combined with the debit of $300,000 in net purchases, the cost of goods sold is $307,000. (The alternative is: beginning inventory of $100,000 + net purchases of $300,000 = cost of goods available of $400,000 – ending inventory of $93,000 = cost of goods sold of $307,000.)",what
Which accounts get closed at the end of a fiscal year?,"The temporary accounts get closed at the end of an accounting year. Temporary accounts include all of the income statement accounts (revenues, expenses, gains, losses), the sole proprietor's drawing account, the income summary account, and any other account that is used for keeping a tally of the current year amounts. Since the temporary accounts are closed at the end of each fiscal year, they will begin the new fiscal year with zero balances.
The accounts that do not get closed (their balances are carried forward to the next accounting year) are referred to as permanent accounts. The balance sheet accounts are permanent accounts.",what
What is the income statement?,"Definition of Income Statement
The income statement is also known as the statement of operations, profit and loss statement, and statement of earnings. It is one of a company's main financial statements. The purpose of the income statement is to report a summary of a company's revenues, expenses, gains, losses, and the resulting net income that occurred during a year, quarter, or other period of time.
Examples of Items Appearing in the Income Statement
The main items reported in the income statement are:

Revenues, which are the amounts earned through the sale of goods and/or the providing of services
Expenses, which include the cost of goods sold, SG&A expenses, and interest expense
Gains and losses, such as the sale of a noncurrent asset for an amount that is different from its book value
Net income, which is the result of subtracting the company's expenses and losses from the company's revenues and gains. Corporations with shares of common stock that are publicly traded often refer to net income as earnings and their income statements must include the earnings per share of common stock

How the Income Statement Amounts are Calculated
The income statement amounts are best calculated for a specific period of time by using the accrual basis of accounting. Under the accrual basis the revenues are the amounts that were earned (not the amount of cash received), and the expenses are the amounts that best match the revenues or were used up during the period (not the cash that was paid out).",what
Why are loan costs amortized?,"Definition of Loan Costs
Loan costs may include legal and accounting fees, registration fees, appraisal fees, processing fees, etc. that were necessary costs in order to obtain a loan.
If the loan costs are significant, they must be amortized to interest expense over the life of the loan because of the matching principle.
Example of Amortizing Loan Costs
Assume that a company incurs loan costs of $120,000 during February in order to obtain a $4 million loan at an annual interest rate of 9%. The loan will begin on March 1 and the entire $4 million of principal will be due five years later. In addition to the one-time loan costs of $120,000 the company will also have the cost of the borrowed money which is $360,000 ($4 million X 9%) of interest each year for five years.
It would be misleading to report the entire $120,000 of loan costs as an expense for the month of February. Hence, the matching principle requires that each month during the life of the loan the company should report $2,000 ($120,000 divided by 60 months) of loan costs as interest expense in addition to the interest expense of $30,000 per month ($4 million X 9% per year = $360,000 per year divided by 12 months per year). The combination of the monthly amortization of $2,000 and the monthly interest expense of $30,000 results in total monthly interest expense of $32,000 for each of the 60 months beginning on March 1.",what
What are the effects of depreciation?,"Definition of Depreciation
Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the cost of a company's assets used in its business from the balance sheet to the income statement (as an expense) over their estimated useful lives.
Depreciation occurs through an accounting adjusting entry in which the account Depreciation Expense is debited and the contra asset account Accumulated Depreciation is credited.
Effects of Depreciation
The following are some of the effects for a corporation that is depreciating assets:

The net income, retained earnings, and stockholders' equity are reduced with the debit to Depreciation Expense
The carrying value of the assets being depreciated and amount of total assets are reduced by the credit to Accumulated Depreciation
The depreciation expense reported on the U.S. income tax return (based on the tax regulations) reduces a corporation's taxable income (and its related income tax payments).",what
What is the difference between interest expense and interest payable?,"Definition of Interest Expense
Assuming the accrual method of accounting, interest expense is the amount of interest that was incurred on debt during a period of time. Interest Expense is also the title of the income statement account that is used to record the interest incurred. Lastly, interest expense is usually a separate line on a company's income statement that indicates the amount that occurred during the period appearing in the heading of the income statement.
Definition of Interest Payable
Interest payable is the amount of interest the company has incurred but has not yet paid as of the date of the balance sheet. Interest Payable is also the title of the current liability account that is used to record and report this amount.
Examples of Interest Expense and Interest Payable
To illustrate the difference between interest expense and interest payable, let's assume that a company borrows $200,000 on November 1 at an annual interest rate of 6%. The company is required to pay each month's interest on the 15th day of the following month. Therefore, the November interest of $1,000 ($200,000 x 6% x 1/12) is to be paid on December 15. The $1,000 of interest incurred during December is to be paid on January 15. Therefore, as of December 31, the company's current liability account Interest Payable must report $1,000 for December's interest. For the two-month period, the company will report Interest Expense of $2,000 (November's and December's interest of $1,000 each month).",what
What is comprehensive income?,"Definition of Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive income for a corporation is the combination of the following amounts which occurred during a specified period of time such as a year, quarter, month, etc.:

Net income or net loss (the details of which are reported on the corporation's income statement), plus
Other comprehensive income (if any)

Examples of other comprehensive income include:

Unrealized gains/losses on hedging derivatives
Foreign currency translation adjustments
Unrealized gains/losses on postretirement benefit plans

Basically, comprehensive income consists of all of the revenues, gains, expenses, and losses that caused stockholders' equity to change during the accounting period.
The amount of net income for the period is added to retained earnings, while the amount of other comprehensive income is added to accumulated other comprehensive income. Retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income are reported on separate lines within stockholders' equity on the end-of-the-period balance sheet.",what
What is a fiscal year?,"Definition of Fiscal Year
A fiscal year is an accounting year that does not end on December 31. (Accounting years of January 1 through December 31 are known as calendar years.)
A fiscal year could be a 12-month period of time or a 52/53-week period of time.
One reason a U.S. business or other organization will have its accounting year end on a date other than December 31 is to coincide with its natural business year.
When an organization's fiscal year ends outside of the CPAs' busy season, the organization may be able to negotiate a lower auditing fee.
Examples of Fiscal Years
A few examples of fiscal years include:

12 months of February 1 through January 31
12 months of October 1 through September 30
12 months of June 1 through May 31
52 weeks ending on the Saturday closest to January 31. (Since 52 weeks X 7 days = 364 days vs. 365 days per year, there will be an occasional 53-week year)

School districts typically have fiscal years of July 1 through June 30 to coincide with its natural business year. Large retailers often end their fiscal years on the Saturday closest to January 31 in order to include sales returns from its peak December sales. The retailers' interim periods will be 13-week ""quarters"" consisting of one 5-week ""month"" plus two 4-week ""months"". This allows for better comparisons between years.",what
Why is there a difference in the amounts for Bad Debts Expense and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts?,"Amount Reported as Bad Debts Expense
The amount reported in the income statement account Bad Debts Expense pertains to the estimated losses from extending credit during the period shown in the heading of the income statement. The estimated amount of Bad Debts Expense could be based on:

A percentage of the company's credit sales during the period, or
The change in the total amount needed in the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts based upon the amounts customers owe on the company's accounts receivable
Amount Reported as Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
The balance reported in the balance sheet account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is the estimated amount of Accounts Receivable that will not be collected. The balance in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts could be based upon:

An aging of the detailed amounts in Accounts Receivable
The result of recording the credit part of the entries to Bad Debts Expense that were based on a percentage of credit sales

Example of Bad Debts Expense and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
To illustrate, let's assume that on December 31 a company had $100,000 in Accounts Receivable and its balance in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts was a credit balance of $3,000. As a result, the December 31 balance sheet will be reporting that $97,000 will be turning to cash. During the first 30 days of January the company does not have any other information on bad accounts receivable. However, on January 31 the company learns that an additional $1,000 of its accounts receivable may not be collected. Therefore, on January 31 the company will make an adjusting entry to debit Bad Debts Expense for $1,000 and to credit Allowance for Doubtful Accounts for $1,000. After this entry is recorded, the company's income statement for the month of January will report Bad Debts Expense of $1,000 and its January 31 balance sheet will report a credit balance in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts in the amount of $4,000.",what
What is accrued income?,"Definition of Accrued Income
Accrued income is an amount that:

A company has earned
The company has a right to receive
The collection is probable
Has not yet been recorded in the general ledger accounts

Under the accrual basis of accounting, accrued income is recorded with an accrual adjusting entry prior to issuing the financial statements.
Example of Accrued Income
One example of accrued income is the interest a company earns on a bond investment. To illustrate, let's assume that a company invested $100,000 on December 1 in a 6% $100,000 bond that pays $3,000 of interest on each June 1 and December 1. On December 31, the company will have earned one month's interest amounting to $500 ($100,000 x 6% per year x 1/12 of a year, or 1/6 of the semiannual $3,000). No interest will be received in December since it will be included in the $3,000 interest that will be received on June 1. The $500 of interest that has been earned during December, but not yet received nor previously recorded as of December 31, is accrued interest income.
The accrued interest income will be recorded with an accrual adjusting entry dated December 31 that debits Interest Receivable (a balance sheet account) for $500, and credits Interest Income (an income statement account) for $500.",what
Is a prepaid expense recorded initially as an expense?,"Definition of Prepaid Expense
A prepaid expense refers to an amount that a company has paid and a portion or all of it will be an expense in a later accounting period.
Example of a Prepaid Expense
A company with an accounting year ending on December 31 has a prepaid expense if on December 1, it paid $6,000 for insurance coverage from December 1 through May 31.
Recording a Prepaid Expense
A prepaid expense can be recorded initially as an expense or as a current asset. Either way, adjusting entries will be needed during the six months to be certain that:

The current month's insurance expense of $1,000 ($6,000/6 months) is reported on each month's income statement.
The unexpired amount of the prepaid insurance is reported on the balance sheet as of the last day of each month. For example, on December 31 the balance sheet must report $5,000. On January 31 the balance sheet must report $4,000, and so on.",what
What is the effect on the income statement when the allowance for uncollectible accounts is not established?,"Definition of Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts
The Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts or Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is a contra asset account that reduces the amount of accounts receivable to the amount that is more likely be collected.
The income statement account Bad Debts Expense is part of the adjusting entry that increases the balance in the Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts.
Effect of No Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts
If a company's balance sheet does not reduce its accounts receivable debit balance with a credit balance in Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts, the company is communicating that it is not anticipating any bad debts expense relating to its existing accounts receivable. Hence, the income statement is delaying the reporting of bad debts expense on its income statement until an account receivable is actually written off as uncollectible.",what
"How, when and why do you prepare closing entries?","Definition of Closing Entries
Closing entries transfer the balances from the temporary accounts to a permanent or real account at the end of the accounting year.
As a result, the temporary accounts will begin the following accounting year with zero balances.
In a computerized accounting system, the closing entries are likely done electronically by simply selecting ""Closing Entries"" or by specifying the beginning and ending dates of the financial statements.
Examples of Closing Entries
Two examples of closing entries are:

The closing of the income statement accounts (revenues, expenses, gains, losses) by transferring their balances to the owner's capital account or the corporation's retained earnings account. This is done after the company's financial statements for the year have been prepared.
The closing of the owner's drawing account by transferring its balance to the owner's capital account.",what
Are payroll withholding taxes an expense or a liability?,"Definition of Payroll Withholding Taxes
Payroll withholding taxes are amounts withheld from employees' wages and salaries. The amounts withheld are actually the employees' money that the employer is required by law to withhold and remit to the government. In other words, the employer is acting as an agent by withholding and remitting the employees' money.
Examples of Payroll Withholding Taxes
The payroll taxes withheld from employees include federal income taxes, state income taxes, and the employees' portion of the FICA or Social Security and Medicare taxes.
Payroll Withholdings are Liabilities
The payroll taxes withheld from employees are a current liability of the employer until the amounts are remitted to the governments. (The taxes withheld from employees are not an expense of the company that withheld them.) 
The payroll taxes that are not withheld from employees are expenses of the employer and are liabilities until the amounts are remitted. Examples include the employer's portion of the FICA tax and unemployment taxes.",what
Are dividend payments shown as an expense on the income statement?,"A corporation's dividends are not an expense and therefore will not appear on its income statement. Cash dividends are a distribution of part of a corporation's earnings that are being paid to its stockholders.
When a corporation has preferred stock, the dividends on preferred stock are deducted from a corporation's net income in order to arrive at earnings available for common stock. Earnings available for common stock is reported on the income statement. It is also used to calculate the common stock's earnings per share. The earnings per share figure is reported on the income statement when the corporation's stock is publicly traded.",what
What is net income?,"Definition of Net Income
Net income is the positive result of a company's revenues and gains minus  its expenses and losses. A negative result is referred to as net loss. (There are a few gains and losses which are not included in the calculation of net income. However, they are part of comprehensive income).
Net income is also known as net earnings. The details of the net income calculation are reported in the business's income statement.
The net income of a regular U.S. corporation includes the income tax expense which pertains to the items reported in its income statement. The net income of a sole proprietorship, partnership, and Subchapter S corporation will not include income tax expense since the owners (not the entity) are responsible for the business's income tax.
Effect of Net Income on the Balance Sheet
A corporation's positive net income causes an increase in the retained earnings, which is part of stockholders' equity. A net loss will cause a decrease in retained earnings and stockholders' equity.
A sole proprietorship's net income will cause an increase in the owner's capital account, which is part of owner's equity. A net loss will cause a decrease in the owner's capital account and owner's equity.",what
Are commissions considered to be revenues or expenses?,"Definition of Commissions Revenues or Expenses
The company or person earning and receiving commissions (such as a percentage of sales) will have commissions revenue. The company or party that pays the commissions will have commissions expense. 
Accounting for Commissions Revenues
Under the accrual basis of accounting, the commissions do not have to be received in order to be reported as revenues. If a company has earned the commissions but has not yet received the money, the company should make an accrual adjusting entry so that its income statement will report the commissions revenues and its balance sheet will report the commissions receivable.
Accounting for Commissions Expense
Under the accrual basis of accounting, the commissions do not have to be paid in order for the company to report commissions expense. If a company owes for commissions on recent sales, but has not yet paid or recorded them, an accrual adjusting entry is made so they are included in the commissions expense reported on its income statement and are also reported as commissions payable (or included in accrued liabilities) on its balance sheet.",what
What is the difference between net cash flow and net income?,"Under the accrual method of accounting, net income is calculated as follows: revenues earned minus the expenses incurred in order to earn those revenues. If a company earns revenues in December but allows those customers to pay in 30 days, the cash from the December revenues will likely be received in January. In this situation the December revenues will increase the December net income, but will not increase the company's December net cash flow.
Under accrual accounting, expenses are matched to the accounting period when the related revenues occur or when the costs have expired. For example, a retailer may have purchased and paid for merchandise in October. However, the merchandise remained in inventory until it was sold in December. The company's net cash flow decreases in October when the company pays for the merchandise. However, net income decreases in December when the cost of the goods sold is matched with the December sales.
There are many other examples of expenses occurring in one accounting period but the payments occur in a different accounting period. In short, the statement of cash flows is a needed financial statement because the income statement does not report cash flows.",what
What is the profit and loss statement?,"The profit and loss statement, or P&L, is a name that is often used for what today is the income statement, statement of income, statement of operations, or statement of earnings. In other words, the profit and loss statement reports a company's revenues, expenses, and most of the gains and losses which occurred during the period of time specified in its heading.
The profit and loss statement's period of time could be a year, a year-to-date period such as nine months, a quarter of a year, one month, four weeks, 52 weeks, etc. (A few gains and losses will not be reported on the profit and loss statement and will instead be reported on the company's statement of comprehensive income.)
Under the accrual basis (or method) of accounting the revenues and expenses reported on the profit and loss statement should be:

the revenues (sales, service fees) that were earned during the accounting period, and
the expenses (cost of goods sold, salaries, rent, advertising, etc.) that match the revenues being reported or have expired during the accounting period

Today, the bottom line of this financial statement will appear as net income, which is the net amount of the revenues, expenses, gains, and losses being reported.",what
What is a contingent asset?,"Definition of Contingent Asset
A contingent asset is a potential asset that is associated with a potential gain. The asset and gain are contingent because they are dependent upon some future event occurring or not occurring.
Because of the concept of conservatism, a contingent asset and gain will not be recorded in a general ledger account or reported on the financial statements until they are certain. [This is different from contingent liabilities and contingent losses, which are recorded in accounts and reported on the financial statements when they are probable and the amount can be estimated.
Example of Contingent Asset
An example of a contingent asset (and its related contingent gain) is a lawsuit filed by Company A against a competitor for infringing on Company A's patent. Even if it is probable (but not certain) that Company A will win the lawsuit, it is a contingent asset and a contingent gain. As such, it will not be recorded in Company A's general ledger accounts until the lawsuit is settled. (At most, Company A could prepare a carefully worded disclosure stating that it has filed the lawsuit but the outcome is uncertain.)",what
Are commissions a cost of goods sold account or an expense?,"Definition of Commissions
Commissions are compensation for obtaining sales. Hence, sales commissions are a selling expense and will be recorded in general ledger accounts having Sales Commissions Expenses in their title. Sales commissions are considered to be operating expenses and are presented on the income statement as SG&A expenses. (SG&A is the acronym for selling, general and administrative expenses.)
Sales commissions are not part of the cost of a product. Therefore, sales commissions are not assigned to the cost of goods held in inventory or to the cost of goods sold.",what
What is carriage outwards?,"Definition of Carriage Outwards
Carriage outwards refers to the transportation costs that a seller must pay when it sells merchandise with the terms FOB Destination. Carriage outwards is also referred to as freight-out, transportation-out, or delivery expense.
The cost of carriage outwards should be reported on the income statement as an operating expense in the same period as the revenue from the sale of the goods. (Carriage outwards is not part of the cost of goods sold.) 
Example of Carriage Outwards
Assume that a supplier sells $700 of merchandise with the terms FOB Destination. The supplier ships the goods via United Parcel Service at a cost of $50. The supplier's income statement will report sales of $700. In addition, it will report the operating expense carriage outwards (or delivery expense) of $50.",what
What is the difference between FIFO and LIFO?,"Difference Between FIFO and LIFO
The difference between FIFO and LIFO will exist only if the unit costs of a company's products are increasing or decreasing.
U.S. companies may elect either the FIFO or the FIFO cost flow assumptions. However, after making a change, a company cannot switch back. For U.S. income tax reporting, a company must use the same cost flow assumption as it uses on its financial statements.
Example of Difference Between FIFO and LIFO
Let's assume that a retail store carried only one product during its first year of business. It purchased 30 units in January at a cost of $40 each, 30 units in June at $43 each, and 30 units in November at $46 each. Thus, for the year the retailer purchased 90 units with a total actual cost of $3,870 [[email protected]$40 + [email protected]$43 + [email protected]$46]. Let's also assume that 70 units were sold and that 20 units remain in inventory at the end of the year.
Using FIFO the company assumes that first costs (the oldest costs) for 70 units will be removed from inventory and will become the cost of goods sold. Therefore, the FIFO cost of the 70 units sold had a cost of $2,950 [[email protected]$40 + [email protected]$43 + [email protected]$46]. FIFO also means the 20 units remaining in inventory had the most recent cost of $46 each for a total of $920.
Using LIFO and the periodic inventory system, the company assumes that the last costs (the most recent actual costs) for 70 units will be removed from inventory first and will become the cost of goods sold regardless of which units were physically shipped to customers. Therefore, the LIFO cost of the 70 units sold is $3,070 [[email protected]$46 + [email protected]$43 + [email protected]$40]. LIFO also means that the 20 units remaining in inventory had the oldest cost of $40 each for a total of $800.
In our example, LIFO results in $120 less of ending inventory ($800 vs. $920), $120 more of cost of goods sold, and therefore $120 less of gross profit. The lower gross profit and the associated lower taxable income for a U.S. company can result in less taxable income, which may result in less income tax payments for a profitable corporation.",what
What is the difference between inventory and the cost of goods sold?,"Definition of Inventory
Inventory for a retailer or distributor is the merchandise that was purchased and has not yet been sold to customers. A manufacturer's inventory consists of raw materials, packaging materials, work-in-process, and the finished goods that are owned and on hand.
Inventory is generally valued at its cost and it is likely to be the largest component of the company's current assets. Since the unit cost of inventory items will change over time, a company must select a cost flow assumption (FIFO, LIFO, average) for removing the costs from inventory and sending them to the cost of goods sold.
Definition of Cost of Goods Sold
The cost of goods sold is the cost of the products that have been sold to customers during the period of the income statement. How the costs flow out of inventory will have an impact on the company's cost of goods sold. The cost of goods sold will likely be the largest expense reported on the income statement.
Example of Inventory Cost and Cost of Goods Sold
To show the connection between inventory and the cost of goods sold, let's assume that a retailer sells only one product. Let's also assume that the retailer begins the year with 100 units of the product and purchases an additional 1,500 units throughout the year. The combination of the beginning inventory plus the purchases is known as the goods available for sale, which in this example is 1,600 units. If there are 125 units on hand at the end of the year, the ending inventory will report the cost of 125 units. The cost of goods sold for the year will be the cost of the 1,475 units that are no longer available.",what
What is gross margin?,"Definition of Gross Margin
Gross margin is the amount remaining after a retailer or manufacturer subtracts its cost of goods sold from its net sales. In other words, gross margin is the retailer's or manufacturer's profit before subtracting its selling, general and administrative, and interest expenses.
Gross Margin Can be an Amount or an Expense
Gross margin could be expressed as:

An amount (also known as gross profit)
A percentage of net sales (also known as gross profit percentage or gross margin ratio)

The gross margin may be calculated for an individual product, a product line, or for the entire company.
Examples of Gross Margin Calculations
If a retailer had net sales of $40,000 and its cost of goods sold was $24,000, the retailer had a gross margin of $16,000 or 40% of net sales ($16,000/$40,000).
A manufacturer sells a product for $40 and its cost of goods sold (which consists of its manufacturing costs) is $28. Therefore, the product's gross margin is $12 ($40 minus $28), or 30% of the selling price ($12/$40).
Difference Between Gross Margin and Profit Margin
Gross margin is the amount or percent before subtracting the selling, general and administrative, and interest expenses. Profit margin is the amount or percent after the selling, general and administrative, and interest expenses are subtracted. For example, a chain of grocery stores many have a gross margin of 20%, but its profit margin may be 1% (of net sales).
What the Gross Margin Tells You
Analysts track a company's gross margin percentage to determine whether the company is able to increase selling prices when costs are increasing or when competitors are reducing prices or expanding their sales efforts. The gross margin of individual products could indicate to management that some products should be promoted more aggressively and some products should be phased out.",what
Is the installation labor for a new asset expensed or included in the cost of the asset?,"Accounting for Labor to Install Asset
The definition of an asset's cost is all costs that are necessary to get an asset in place and ready for use. Therefore, the cost of the installation labor (wages and related fringe benefits) is part of the cost of the asset (and not an immediate expense of the accounting period).
The total cost of the asset, including installation costs, will become an expense when the asset depreciated over the asset's useful life.",what
What is cost incurred?,"Definition of Cost Incurred
A cost incurred is a cost that a company (or other organization) becomes liable for.
Example of Cost Incurred
Assume that a retailer begins operations on December 1 and its electric meter is read by the utility on the last day of every month. During December the retailer will have incurred the cost of the electricity it used during December.
Under the accrual basis of accounting the retailer must report a current liability on December 31 for the amount owed to the utility for the electricity it used to that point. On its income statement for December, the retailer must also report electricity expense for the cost of the electricity that it used during December. This may require the retailer to record an accrual adjusting entries with an estimated amount (if the electricity bill is not received in time).",what
What is the difference between dividends and interest expense?,"Dividends are a distribution of a corporation's earnings to its stockholders. Dividends are not an expense of the corporation and, therefore, dividends do not reduce the corporation's net income or its taxable income. When a dividend of $100,000 is declared and paid, the corporation's cash is reduced by $100,000 and its retained earnings (part of stockholders' equity) is reduced by $100,000.
Interest on bonds and other debt is an expense of the corporation. The interest expense will reduce the corporation's net income and its taxable income. When interest expense occurs and is paid, the corporation's cash is reduced by the interest payment, but some cash will be saved by the reduction in income taxes. The corporation's retained earnings will also be reduced by less than the amount of interest expense. For example, if a corporation has an incremental tax rate of 40%, interest expense of $100,000 will result in $40,000 less in income tax expense and income tax payments. This means that an interest payment of $100,000 will reduce the corporation's cash and retained earnings by the net amount of $60,000 ($100,000 of interest minus $40,000 of tax savings).
Since interest is formally promised to the lenders, accountants must accrue interest expense and the related liability Interest Payable. If the payment for interest is not made, the corporation will face legal consequences.
Dividends on common stock are not legally required. Therefore, if the corporation does not declare a dividend there is no liability for the omitted dividends.",what
What are accrued revenues and when are they recorded?,"Accrued revenues are fees and interest that have been earned and sales that occurred, but they have not yet been recorded through the normal invoicing paperwork. Since these are not yet in the accountant's general ledger, they will not appear on the financial statements unless an adjusting entry is entered prior to preparing the financial statements.
Here's an example. Your company lent a supplier $100,000 on December 1. The agreement is for the $100,000 to be repaid on February 28 along with $3,000 of interest for the three months of December through February. As of December 31 your company will not have a transaction/invoice/receipt for the interest it is earning since all of the interest is due on February 28. Without an adjusting entry to accrue the revenue it earned in December, your company's financial statements as of December 31 will not be reporting the $1,000 (one-third of the $3,000 of interest) that it has earned in December. In order for the financial statements to be correct on the accrual basis of accounting, the accountant needs to record an adjusting entry dated as of December 31. The adjusting entry will consist of a debit of $1,000 to Interest Receivable (a balance sheet account) and a credit of $1,000 to Interest Income or Interest Revenue (income statement accounts).",what
How do you amortize goodwill?,"Prior to 2001, the U.S. accounting rules required goodwill to be amortized to expense over a period not to exceed 40 years. However, in June 2001 the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued its Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. This accounting pronouncement ended the automatic amortization of goodwill to expense for U.S. financial reporting.
While goodwill is no longer amortized to expense in uniform increments, goodwill is to be measured annually to determine if there is an impairment loss. (However beginning in 2015, private companies may opt to amortize goodwill generally over a 10-year period and thereby minimize the cost and complexity involved with testing for impairment.)",what
Are sales discounts reported as an expense?,"Definition of Sales Discounts
Sales discounts are also known as cash discounts or early payment discounts. Sales discounts (along with sales returns and allowances) are deducted from gross sales to arrive at the company's net sales. Hence, the general ledger account Sales Discounts is a contra revenue account. Sales discounts are not reported as an expense.
Example of Sales Discounts
A company offers its business customer sales discounts of 1/10, net 30. For the recent year, the company had gross sales of $510,000 and had sales discounts of $4,000 and sales returns and allowance of $5,000. As a result, the company reported net sales of $501,000.",what
Does sales commission get reported in the income statement?,"Sales commissions earned by a company would be reported as revenue in the company's income statement. Sales commissions that a company must pay to others are reported as an expense.
Under the accrual basis of accounting (as opposed to the cash basis) commission revenues should be reported when the company earns the commissions. The commission expense should be reported when the company has incurred the expense and liability. (This would also be the time when the other party has earned the commissions and the right to receive them.)
The commission revenues would be reported as operating revenue (in the section where sales are reported), if the commissions are earned as a main activity of the company. If the commissions are incidental or involve a peripheral activity, these commission revenues would be reported as other income.
Commission expense would be reported as a selling expense along with other operating expenses when they are related to the company's main activities. If a commission expense pertains to a peripheral activity, it would be reported as other expense.",what
When should a product warranty liability be recorded?,"A product warranty liability and warranty expense should be recorded at the time the product is sold, if it is probable that customers will be making claims under the warranty and the amount can be estimated. These two conditions are part of the FASB's Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. You can read this pronouncement (which includes a discussion of product warranties) at www.FASB.org/st.
When the warranty liability is both probable and can be estimated, the accountant will accrue in the period of the sale a liability and an expense for the future warranty work. (This matching of warranty expense with the related sales revenue is reasonable, since the warranty could be as important in getting the sale as the product's advertising expense.)
When work is done under the warranty coverage, the warranty liability will be reduced. To illustrate, assume that an automobile manufacturer debits Warranty Expense for $1,000 and credits Warranty Liability for $1,000 in the period that a car is sold. When the car needs a $400 repair under the warranty, the manufacturer will reduce Warranty Liability by debiting the account for $400. (Another account, such as Cash, will be credited for the $400 it remits to the dealer that performed the repair work.) This will leave a liability of $600 for additional repairs during the remainder of the warranty period.",what
"If inventory is understated at the end of the year, what is the effect on net income?","If inventory is understated at the end of the year, the net income for the year is also understated.
Here's a brief explanation. If a company has a cost of goods available of $100,000 and it assigns too little of that cost to inventory, then too much of that cost will appear on the income statement as the cost of goods sold. Too much cost on the income statement will mean too little net income.
Another way to view this is through the accounting equation, Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity. If you assign too little of the cost of goods available to Assets, then the amount of Owner's Equity will be too little—caused by net income being too little.",what
What is the difference between income and profit?,"Some people intend for the terms income and profit to have the same meaning. For example, the income statement was commonly referred to as the profit and loss (P&L) statement. When a company is profitable, we mean that the company has a positive net income.
To aid in understanding these terms, the word ""net"" is often added. Hence, we often see the terms net income and net profit. This communicates that the amounts are the remainder after expenses have been deducted. For example, a company's profit margin is often listed as the net profit margin (which is defined as the company's net income divided by its net sales). The word ""net"" also helps to distinguish a company's net profit from its gross profit, and its net profit margin from its gross profit margin.
Some people use the term income to mean revenues. For example, a bank or an individual will often refer to the interest they earn on bond investments as interest income or investment income. A retailer will refer to the sales of merchandise as revenues, but the revenues from secondary activities will be reported as other income or nonoperating income.
It is wise to keep in mind that different meanings are not unusual among people, businesses and countries.",what
What are consolidated financial statements?,"Consolidated financial statements combine the financial statements of separate legal entities controlled by a parent company into one set of financial statements for the entire group of companies.
For example, let's assume that Northern Electric Power (NEP) is an electric utility with its stock traded on a stock exchange. NEP acquires all of the stock of Midwest Gas Corporation (MGC). Both NEP and MGC continue as separate legal entities. NEP is the parent company and MGC is the subsidiary company. Each of these corporations will continue to operate its respective business and each will issue its own financial statements. However, the investors and potential investors in NEP will find it helpful to see the financial results and the financial position of the economic entity (the combination of NEP and MGC) that they control.
The consolidated income statement of NEP will report all of the revenues that the economic entity earned from outside customers. (Since the sales of electricity from NEP to MGC and the sales of gas from MGC to NEP are not earned outside of the economic entity they are eliminated.) The consolidated income statement will also report all of the expenses that were incurred outside of the economic entity. (Since the purchases of electricity by MGC from NEP and the purchases of gas by NEP from MGC did not occur outside of the economic entity they are also eliminated.)
The consolidated balance sheet of NEP will report all of the cash, receivables, plant, etc. of the economic entity. It will also report all of the liabilities of the economic entity. (Amounts owed and receivable between NEP and MGC are eliminated in the consolidated balance sheet.)
This is a very brief overview of consolidated financial statements. It is a major topic within the university course and textbook entitled advanced accounting.",what
Why isn't the direct write off method of uncollectible accounts receivable the preferred method?,"Definition of Direct Write Off Method
Under the direct write off method of accounting for credit losses pertaining to accounts receivable, no bad debts expense is reported on the income statement until an account receivable is actually removed from the company's receivables.
Under the direct write off method there is no contra asset account such as  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. This means that the balance sheet is reporting the full amount of accounts receivable and therefore implying that the full amount will be converted to cash.
Reason Why the Direct Write Off Method is Not Preferred
The accounting profession does not prefer the direct method for the following reasons:

The accounts receivable are more likely to be reported on the balance sheet at an amount that is greater than the amount that will actually be collected
The bad debts expense resulting from having sold goods on credit will appear on the income statement only after the bad account is identified and removed from the company's accounts receivable. Hence, the bad debts expense is reported much later than would be the case under the allowance method.

[The Internal Revenue Service requires the direct write off method in order to prevent taxpayers from claiming a bad debts expenses based on an anticipated potential loss.]",what
What is the difference between expense and loss?,"Definition of Expense
An expense is a cost that a company incurs or uses up when it earns revenues.
Examples of Expenses
A few examples of the many expenses that a company incurs in earning revenues are:

Cost of goods sold
Sales commissions expense
Delivery expense
Rent expense
Salaries expense
Advertising expense

Definition of Loss
A loss could have several meanings. The following examples illustrate how the term is used.
Examples of Losses
Some examples of losses include:

The sale of a long-lived asset for an amount that is less than the asset's book value
An unfavorable settlement of a lawsuit against the company
The retirement of bonds payable at a cost that is greater than the carrying value of the bonds

Loss is also used to describe write-down of inventory from cost to market.
Finally, loss is also used to describe the bottom line of an income statement that reports expenses in excess of revenues.
The FASB's Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No. 6 (December 1985) discusses expenses and losses in paragraphs 80-89. You can access this concepts statement at no cost at www.FASB.org/st by selecting ""Concepts Statements"".",what
What is the difference between revenues and earnings?,"A U.S. corporation's revenues  are reported on the top line of its income statement, while its earnings are reported on the bottom line (or near the bottom) of the income statement.
Revenues is the gross amount earned from selling goods or providing services during the period shown in the heading of the income statement. In other words, revenues is the amount earned before deducting the cost of goods sold, expenses, and losses.
Earnings is the net amount earned after deducting the cost of goods sold, expenses and losses. It is often presented as net earnings or net income. When a corporation's stock is publicly-traded, the earnings must also be reported on the income statement as earnings per share (EPS) of common stock.",what
Which accounts are debited in the closing entries?,"Definition of Closing Entries
Closing entries occur at the end of an accounting year to transfer the balances in the temporary accounts to a permanent or real account. The intended result is for each temporary account to begin the next accounting year with a zero balance.
The temporary accounts include the income statement accounts (revenue, expense, gain, loss, income summary) and also the drawing account of a sole proprietorship. The balances in these accounts will ultimately end up in the sole proprietor's capital account or the corporation's retained earnings account.
Accounts that are Debited in the Closing Entries
The following temporary accounts normally have credit balances that require a debit as part of the closing entries:

Revenue accounts
Gain accounts
Contra expense accounts

Income Statement: Retail/Whsle - Corporation, Multiple-Step
Statement of Owner's Equity: Sole Proprietor",what
"If a company earns a profit, which balance sheet items change?","Definition of Profit
Profit is the result of revenues minus expenses.
How Profits Change the Balance Sheet
Since all business transactions affect at least two accounts, there will likely be an enormous number of changes to the balance sheet. Here are some of the changes:

Owner's equity or stockholders' equity will increase by the positive amount of net income
Accounts receivable will change by the amount of sales/services provided with credit terms
Inventory will decrease when goods are sold
Cash will increase when goods are sold for cash and when accounts receivable are collected
Cash will decrease when cash is paid for expenses, inventory, equipment, liabilities, etc.
Accounts payable will increase for expenses that were not paid with cash
Accumulated depreciation will change when an asset is depreciated

Again, the list is just a few of the balance sheet changes that may occur when a company has profitable operations.",what
What are interim financial statements?,"Interim financial statements for a corporation are the financial statements covering a period of less than one year. Often interim financial statements are issued for the quarters between the annual financial statements. The purpose is to give investors and other users updated information on the corporation's operations. Unlike the annual financial statements, the interim financial statements are usually unaudited and condensed. Therefore, it is wise to also read the previously issued and complete annual financial statements and reports.
In order for the interim income statement amounts to add up to the amounts reported in the official income statement for the year, it is necessary that the accounting practices in the interim financial statements be consistent with the accounting practices that will be followed in the annual financial statements.",what
What is a compilation?,"Definition of Compilation
A compilation refers to a company's financial statements that have been prepared or compiled by an outside accountant. 
A compilation is usually part of an accounting firm's write-up service. With compilations, or compiled financial statements, the outside accountant converts the client's data into financial statements without providing any assurances or auditing services.
A compilation report should accompany the compiled financial statements to indicate that the financial statements 1) are the representation of the company's management, and 2) have not been reviewed or audited and therefore the accountant does not offer an opinion or any assurances on the financial statements.
Compilations allow companies without an accountant to have financial statements prepared by an outside professional without the higher cost of reviewed or audited financial statements.
Example of a Compilation
A company prepares its own monthly financial statements by using popular accounting software. However, as part of the company's loan agreement with its bank, the company must provide the bank with annual financial statements that have been compiled by a certified public accountant. (The bank does not require the borrower to incur the expense of a CPA's review or audit.)",what
How should an interest only loan be recorded?,"Defintion of an Interest Only Loan
An interest only loan specifies that only interest payments are required during the life of the loan. No principal payment is required until the loan comes due.
Example of an Interest Only Loan
Assume that on July 1, a company borrows $100,000 with an annual interest rate of 12%. The interest for each month is to be paid on the last day of the month. No principal payment is required until the loan comes due in two years.
On July 1 the company records the loan as follows:

Debit Cash for $100,000 (the proceeds from the loan)
Credit Notes Payable for $100,000 (the principal amount that is due in two years)

Since the principal balance of $100,000 will not be reduced until two years later, the note payable is reported on the balance sheet as a noncurrent or long-term liability for the first year. During the second year the principal balance is reported as a current liability.
If the current month's interest is paid on the last day of each month, there will be no interest liability reported on the end-of-the-month balance sheets. Each month's payment of interest requires a credit to Cash and a debit to Interest Expense, which is reported on the monthly income statement.",what
What are the elements of financial statements?,"Definition of Elements of Financial Statements
The elements of financial statements are the classes of items contained in the financial statements. 
Examples of Elements of Financial Statements
The elements of the financial statements include:

Assets
Liabilities
Equity or net assets
Investments by owners
Distributions to owners
Comprehensive income
Revenues
Expenses
Gains
Losses

The above list is based on the FASB's Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No. 6, Elements of Financial Statements, which you may read at www.FASB.org.",what
What is the accrual method?,"The accrual method of accounting reports revenues on the income statement when they are earned even if the customer will pay 30 days later. At the time that the revenues are earned the company will credit a revenue account and will debit the asset account Accounts Receivable. (When the customer pays 30 days after the revenues were earned, the company will debit Cash and will credit Accounts Receivable.)
The accrual method of accounting also requires that expenses and losses be reported on the income statement when they occur even if payment will take place 30 days later. For example, if a company has a $15,000 repair done on December 15 and the vendor allows for payment on January 15, the company will report a repair expense and a liability of $15,000 as of December 15. (On January 15 the company will credit Cash and will debit the liability account.)
The accrual method of accounting, which is also known as the accrual basis of accounting, is required for large companies. (The cash method of accounting may be used by individuals and some small companies.) The accrual method and the associated adjusting entries will result in a more complete and accurate reporting of a company's assets, liabilities, equity, and earnings during each accounting period.",what
What are sales discounts?,"Definition of Sales Discounts
Sales discounts (if offered by sellers) reduce the amounts owed to the sellers of products, when the buyers pay within the stated discount periods. Sales discounts are also known as cash discounts and early payment discounts.
Sales discounts are recorded in a contra revenue account such as Sales Discounts. Hence, its debit balance will be one of the deductions from sales (gross sales) in order to report the amount of net sales.
Example of Sales Discounts
To illustrate a sales discount let's assume that a manufacturer sells $900 of products and its credit terms are 1/10, n/30. This means that the buyer can satisfy the $900 obligation if it pays $891 ($900 minus $9 of sales discount) within 10 days. The alternative is for the buyer to pay $900 within 30 days.
If the buyer pays the $891 within 10 days, the seller will record the money received as follows:

Debit Cash for $891
Debit Sales Discounts for $9
Credit Accounts Receivable for $900",what
What are sales?,"In accounting, sales refers to the revenues earned when a company sells its goods, products, merchandise, etc. (If a company sells one of its noncurrent assets that was used in its business, the amount received is not recorded in its Sales account.)
The amounts recorded at the time of the sales transaction is also known as gross sales since there may be subsequent subtractions for sales returns, sales allowances, and early payment discounts. (Gross sales minus these subtractions results in the amount of net sales.)
Under the accrual basis or accrual method of accounting, goods sold on credit are reported as sales (revenue) when the goods have been transferred to the buyer. Usually this occurs before the seller receives payment from the buyer. The sales on credit are recorded with a debit to Accounts Receivable and a credit to Sales.",what
What are the required financial statements?,"The required financial statements for U.S. business corporations are:

Statement of income. This financial statement is also known as the statement of operations, statement of earnings, or income statement. It reports the corporation's revenues, expenses, gains and losses (except for items stipulated as other comprehensive income) for a period of time such as a year, quarter, 13 months, etc.
Statement of comprehensive income. This financial statement begins with the bottom line of the income statement and then lists the items considered to be other comprehensive income. Some of these items involve currency translation, hedging, and pensions.
Balance sheet. This statement of financial position reports a corporation's assets, liabilities and stockholders' equity as of the final instant of the date shown in its heading (December 31, January 31, June 30, etc.)
Statement of cash flows. This statement reports the major causes for the change in cash and cash equivalents during the accounting period. The cash flows are presented as operating, investing, or financing activities.
Statement of stockholders' equity. This financial statement is often presented as the statement of shareholders' equity, statement of equity, statement of changes in stockholders' equity, etc. It reports all of the changes in stockholders' equity which occurred during the accounting period.

The five annual financial statements must be accompanied with notes to the financial statements. These notes are needed in order to disclose additional information about items that are reported or are not reported in the financial statements.
You can see examples of the required financial statements (and the required notes) for a publicly traded U.S. corporation by searching the Internet for the corporation's name plus the words investor relations. Select Annual Reports (or select SEC filings and annual reports or 10-K).",what
What are the notes to the financial statements?,"Definition of Notes to Financial Statements
The notes to the financial statements are a required, integral part of a company's external financial statements. They are required since not all relevant financial information can be communicated through the amounts shown (or not shown) on the face of the financial statements. The notes are also referred to as footnote disclosures.
Generally, the notes are the main method for a company to comply with the full disclosure principle.
Example of Notes to Financial Statements
The first note to the financial statements is usually a summary of the company's significant accounting policies for the use of estimates, revenue recognition, inventories, property and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, fair value measurement, discontinued operations, foreign currency translation, recently issued accounting pronouncements, and others.
The remaining notes contain the details (including schedules of amounts) for items such as inventories, accrued liabilities, income taxes, employee benefit plans, leases, business segment information, fair value measurements, derivative instruments and hedging, stock options, commitments and contingencies, and more. 
Each external financial statement should also include a reference to the notes, such as: The accompanying notes are an integral part of the financial statements.",what
Is depreciation a source of funds?,"Definition of Depreciation
Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the cost of a business asset to expense over the useful life of the asset. The accounting for depreciation is a debit to Depreciation Expense and a credit to Accumulated Depreciation. As you can see, the entry does not involve the account Cash. Hence, depreciation expense is referred to as a noncash expense.
Example of Depreciation
Assume that a sidewalk florist operates a cash only business. During the most recent year, the florist had cash revenues of $100,000, cash expenses of $70,000, and depreciation expense of $8,000. Therefore, the net income reported on its income statement was $22,000. (The depreciation pertains to a truck purchased in an earlier year.)
Depreciation and the Statement of Cash Flows
The florist's statement of cash flows (using the indirect method) begins with the net income of $22,000. Next, the depreciation expense of $8,000 is shown as a positive amount and is added to the net income to arrive at $30,000, which equals the cash receipts of $100,000 minus cash expenses of $70,000.
Depreciation expense was added to the net income because the depreciation expense had reduced net income but cash was not reduced. In other words, the positive $8,000 of depreciation expense is not a source of cash, it is merely a needed adjustment to convert the accrual net income to the cash provided from the florist's operating activities. 
While the amount of depreciation expense is not a source of cash, it does reduce a corporation's taxable income. That in turn reduces a profitable corporation's cash payments for income taxes (by the amount of the corporation's income tax rate). The savings of income tax payments is equivalent to a source of cash.",what
What is the statement of activities?,"The statement of activities is one of the main financial statements of a nonprofit or not-for-profit organization.
A nonprofit's statement of activities is issued instead of the income statement which is issued by a for-profit business.
The statement of activities focuses on the total organization (as opposed to focusing on funds within the organization) and reports the following:

Revenues such as contributions, program fees, membership dues, grants, investment income, and amounts released from restrictions.
Expenses reported in categories such as major programs, fundraising, and management and general.
The change in net assets resulting from items 1 and 2.

The statement of activities will have multiple columns in order to report the amounts for each of the following classes of net assets: without donor restrictions, with donor restrictions, and total.",what
What is the difference between unearned revenue and unrecorded revenue?,"In financial accounting, unearned revenue refers to amounts received prior to being earned. For example, if ABC Service Co. receives $24,000 on December 31, 2012 for a one-year service agreement covering January 1 through December 31, 2013, the entire $24,000 is unearned as of December 31, 2012. On the December 31, 2012 balance sheet ABC should report a liability such as Unearned Revenues for $24,000. During 2013 ABC should move $2,000 per month from the liability account on its balance sheet to a revenue account on its income statement.
I associate unrecorded revenue with revenues that were earned, but not yet recorded in a company's accounting records. For example, an electric utility will provide electricity to customers for up to one month before it reads the customers' meters, calculates the bills and records the billings as revenues and accounts receivable. As a result, the electric utility will have up to one month of unrecorded revenue. At each balance sheet date, the utility should accrue for the revenues it earned but had not yet recorded. This is done through an adjusting entry that debits a balance sheet receivable account and credits an income statement revenue account.",what
What does it mean to report expenses by function?,"To report expenses by function means to report them according to the activity for which the expenses were incurred.
For a business, the reporting of expenses by function means the income statement will report expenses according to the following functional classifications: manufacturing, selling, general administrative, and financing.
For a not-for-profit organization, the reporting of expenses by function means the statement of activities will report expenses according to the following functional classifications: 1) each of its major programs, and 2) the supporting services which are a) management and general, b) fund-raising, and c) membership development. It will also present the expenses by nature, such as salaries, electricity, repairs, etc.
(Classifying expenses according to salaries, electricity, repairs, etc. is referred to as natural classifications, or classifying expenses by their nature.)",what
What is the difference between expenses and payments?,"Under the accrual method of accounting, expenses are costs that have been used up or have been incurred in the process of earning revenues and/or operating a business. For example, a retailer will report its cost of the goods sold as an expense of the period in which the related sales occurred (even if the retailer has not yet paid for the goods, or had paid for the goods in an earlier period). Some expenses are allocations of a cost that was paid in an earlier period (e.g. depreciation of an asset purchased in a previous year, the allocation of a 6-month insurance premium). Expenses also include costs incurred in the current period that will be paid in a later period (e.g. current advertising that will be paid for in the next accounting period). Interest on a loan is a daily expense even though all of the interest will be paid when the loan comes due in the next accounting period.
A payment is a disbursement of money (usually in the form of a check or currency). Some payments are current period expenses (e.g. current month's rent payment) but many payments are not expenses of the current period. Here are a few examples of payments that are not expenses:

a payment of $100,000 to purchase the land adjacent to a company will never become an expense
payments that are cash dividends to stockholders will never be a corporation's expense
principal payments to reduce a loan payable will never be an expense
payments to remit payroll tax withholdings will never be an expense
payments to reduce liabilities resulting from expenses reported in earlier accounting periods (e.g. payments to reduce interest payable, accounts payable, taxes payable)

Some current period payments will result in expenses in future periods:

payments for construction of a building that will be put into service next year
payments for an exhibit at next year's trade show
payments for services to be received in a future accounting period",what
What is meant by nonoperating expenses and losses?,"Nonoperating expenses are the expenses incurred by a business which are outside of its main or central operations. Nonoperating expenses are also described as incidental or peripheral. A common example is a retailer's interest expense. The retailer's main operations are purchasing and selling merchandise. Borrowing money is outside of its main or central operations.
Losses often involve the disposal of property, plant and equipment for a cash amount that is less than the carrying amount (or book value) of the asset sold. An example of a loss is the retailer's disposal of a delivery truck for a cash amount that is less than the truck's carrying amount. Another example is a loss from a settlement of a lawsuit.
Nonoperating expenses and losses are often reported on the income statement after the subtotal Income from operations and will often appear with the caption Other income and (expenses).",what
Is contribution margin the same as operating income?,"Contribution margin is different from operating income.
Contribution margin is revenues minus the variable costs and expenses. For example, a retailer's contribution margin is sales minus the cost of goods sold and the variable selling expenses and the variable administrative expenses and any variable nonoperating expenses. (Perhaps some interest expense varies with sales.)
A retailer's operating income is sales minus the cost of goods sold and all selling and administrative expenses (fixed and variable). Operating income is the net income before the nonoperating items such as interest revenue, interest expense, gain or loss on the sale of plant assets, etc.
Contribution margin is used to determine the Break-even Point.",what
What is other comprehensive income?,"Definition of Other Comprehensive Income
Other comprehensive income, or OCI, consists of items that have an effect on the balance sheet amounts, but the effect is not reported on the company's income statement. Instead, these changes are reported on the statement of comprehensive income along with the amount of net income from the income statement.
Since the OCI items do not affect the net income, they do not cause a change in a corporation's retained earnings. Instead, the current period's OCI items cause a change in accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a different component of stockholders' equity.
Examples of Other Comprehensive Income
Some examples of the items classified as other comprehensive income include:

Unrealized gains/losses on hedge/derivative financial instruments
Foreign currency translation adjustments
Unrealized gains/losses on postretirement benefit plans",what
What is income smoothing?,"Income smoothing refers to reducing the fluctuations in a corporation's earnings. Income smoothing can range from good business methods to fraudulent reporting.
Some business practices are ethical and will result in income smoothing. For example, a corporation might have an employee bonus plan, a deferred profit sharing plan, and a charitable giving plan that will result in expenses that total 25% of its pretax profits. In addition, a U.S. corporation might have a combined federal and state income tax rate of 40% on its incremental pretax profits. These examples will smooth income by causing huge expenses when profits are huge, and will result in little expense when profits are little. (Losses could actually result in a negative income tax expense.) In a year of low profits a corporation might eliminate jobs and postpone maintenance expenses. When profits are higher the corporation will add jobs and perform the maintenance that it had avoided.
The term income smoothing is more likely associated with the manipulation of earnings, creative accounting and the aggressive interpretation and application of generally accepted accounting principles. Perhaps a company will increase its allowance for doubtful accounts with a significant charge to bad debts expense in the years with high profits. Then in years of low profits, the company will reduce the allowance for doubtful accounts. Perhaps a U.S. manufacturer using LIFO will deliberately reduce its inventory quantities in low profit years in order to liquidate the old LIFO layers containing low unit costs. Other manufacturers might increase production when sales and profits are low in order to have lower unit costs.
Smoothing income by abusing the leeway in accounting principles is unethical and does a disservice to the users of the financial statements. Accountants should follow their general guidelines such as consistency, comparability, neutrality, full disclosure and conservatism.",what
How do you account for bond issue costs?,"The costs associated with issuing bonds should be recorded in a contra liability account such as Bond Issue Costs. Over the life of the bonds you will need to systematically move the bond issue cost from the balance sheet to the income statement. Accountants refer to this as amortizing the costs.
Let's illustrate the amortization of bond issue costs by assuming the total of the bond issue costs were $24,000 and the bonds will mature in 10 years. Each month you would debit Interest Expense for $200 ($24,000 divided by 120 months) and would credit Bond Issue Costs for $200. The concept is to match the $24,000 cost to the accounting periods that are benefiting from the bonds having been issued.
Our discussion pertains to financial statement reporting and we are not familiar with income tax reporting. You should discuss the income tax treatment with your tax adviser.",what
How do I record money received for an insurance claim on inventory loss?,"The money received from an insurance company for a claim involving a loss on inventory stock is debited to Cash. Any other proceeds from disposing of the inventory items will also be debited to Cash.
In addition, the Inventory account is credited for the carrying cost of the inventory items, which is usually the original cost of the items. If the total of the debits to Cash is greater than the credits to Inventory, the difference is credited to a gain account, such as Gain from Inventory Damage. If the total of the debits to Cash is less than the credits to Inventory, the difference is a debit to a loss account, such as Loss from Inventory Damage.",what
What is a contra expense account?,"A contra expense account is a general ledger expense account that is expected to have a credit balance instead of the usual debit balance. In other words, the account's credit balance is contrary to (or opposite of) the usual debit balance for an expense account.
Another description of a contra expense account is an account that reduces or offsets the amounts reported in one or more of the other general ledger expense accounts.
One use of a contra expense account is to record the amounts of expenses that were reimbursed by its employees. For example, Company M might debit its expense account 4210 Employee Health Insurance Expense when recording the insurance company invoice of $10,000. If Company M required its employees to reimburse it for $2,000, Company M could credit its contra expense account 4211 Portion of 4210 Reimb by Employees. The benefit of using the contra expense account is that the company's managers can look in account 4210 to immediately see the company's total cost of the health insurance. They can also easily see in account 4211 the amount that the employees paid. The income statement could simply report the net amount of the expense, which is $8,000 ($10,000 minus $2,000).",what
Should inventories be reported at their cost or at their selling prices?,"Generally inventories are reported at their cost. A merchant's inventory would be reported at the merchant's cost to purchase the items. A manufacturer's inventory would be at its cost to produce the items (the cost of direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead).
However, if the net realizable value (NRV) of the inventory is less than the cost, the NRV will usually need to be reported on the balance sheet instead of the cost. Net realizable value is defined as the expected selling price in the ordinary course of business minus any costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. When the cost of the inventory is written down to its NRV, the amount of the write down is reported on the income statement. (In a few industries, such as gold mining and meatpacking, it is accepted practice to report the inventory at its net realizable value.)
Since the unit cost of items in inventory is likely to be changing (think inflation), the costs used for inventory reporting will be based on a cost flow assumption. For example, the FIFO cost flow assumption will result in the inventory being reported at the more recent costs, since the first costs are assumed to have been the first costs out of inventory. Under the LIFO cost flow assumption, the inventory will be valued at the older costs, since the more recent costs are assumed to be the first costs to flow out of inventory.",what
How much do you depreciate an asset and when?,"Depreciation begins when you place an asset in service and it ends when you take an asset out of service or when you have expensed its cost, whichever comes first.
For financial statements, you are guided by the matching principle. The objective is to match the cost of the asset to the accounting periods in which revenues were earned by using the asset. There are two estimates needed: 1) the number of years that the asset will be used, and 2) the salvage value at the end of the asset's use. If an asset has a cost of $100,000 and is expected to be used for 10 years and then have no salvage value, most companies will depreciate the asset at the rate of $10,000 per year. This is known as the straight line method of depreciation.
For income tax purposes in the U.S., the Internal Revenue Service has determined the number of years that various assets will be useful and it assumes there will be no salvage value. The IRS also allows companies to take larger depreciation deductions in the earlier years and smaller deductions in the later years of the assets' lives. This is known as accelerated depreciation.
As you probably noted from the above information, in any one year the depreciation expense on the financial statements will be different from the depreciation expense on the income tax return. However, over the life of an asset, the total depreciation expense will be the same. Accountants refer to this as a timing difference.",what
What is the allowance method?,"Definition of Allowance Method
The allowance method usually refers to one of the two ways for reporting bad debts expense that results from a company selling goods or services on credit. (The other way is the direct write-off method.)
Under the allowance method, a company records an adjusting entry at the end of each accounting period for the amount of the losses it anticipates as the result of extending credit to its customers. The entry will involve the operating expense account Bad Debts Expense and the contra-asset account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. Later, when a specific account receivable is actually written off as uncollectible, the company debits Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and credits Accounts Receivable.
The allowance method is preferred over the direct write-off method because:

The income statement will report the bad debts expense closer to the time of the sale or service, and
The balance sheet will report a more realistic net amount of accounts receivable that will actually be turning to cash

The allowance method can be applied in one or both of the following ways:

Focusing on the bad debts expense that is needed on the income statement
Focusing on the balance needed in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts (which will be reported on the balance sheet)

Examples of Allowance Method
Let's assume that a corporation begins operations on November 1 in an industry where it is common to give credit terms of net 30 days. In this industry approximately 0.3% of credit sales will not be collected.
Next, let's assume that the corporation focuses on the bad debts expense. If the corporation's actual credit sales for November are $800,000 it will record an adjusting entry dated November 30 to debit Bad Debts Expense for $2,400 ($800,000 X 0.003) and credit Allowance for Doubtful Accounts for $2,400. As a result, its November income statement will be matching $2,400 of bad debts expense with the credit sales of $800,000. If the balance in Accounts Receivable is $800,000 as of November 30, the corporation will report Accounts Receivable (net) of $797,600.
Focusing on the balance in the account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, the corporation will adjust the balance in the account Allowance for Doubtful Accounts so that the combination of that credit balance and the debit balance in Accounts Receivable will be equal to the amount that is expected to turn to cash. The expected amount will likely be determined by aging the accounts receivable.
If the corporation prepares weekly financial statements, it might focus on the bad debts expense for its weekly financial statements, but at the end of each quarter focus on the allowance account.",what
Why is the distinction between product costs and period costs important?,"The distinction between product costs and period costs is important to:

Properly measure a company's net income during the time specified on its income statement, and
To report the proper cost of inventory on the balance sheet

Definition of Product Costs
Product costs include the costs to manufacture products or to purchase products. If a product is unsold, the product costs will be reported as inventory on the balance sheet. When the product is sold, its cost is removed from inventory and will be included on the income statement as the cost of goods sold. Product costs are also referred to as inventoriable costs.
Examples of Product Costs
The product costs for a retailer will be the amount paid to the supplier plus any freight-in. Product costs for a manufacturer will be the direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead used to manufacture a product.
Definition of Period Costs
Period costs are expenses that will be reported on the income statement without ever attaching to products. Since they are not product costs, period costs will not be included in the cost of inventory. Instead, period costs will be referred to as period expenses since they will be reported on the income statement as selling, general and administrative (SG&A) or interest expenses.
Example of Period Costs
Selling expenses (such as commissions, salaries of sales employees, advertising), general and administrative (general office salaries, rent, utilities, etc.), and interest expense will be reported on the income statement when they are directly related to sales or when they are used up. For example, the insurance premiums that a company pays for nonmanufacturing protection will be expensed in the period in which the insurance premiums expire. (However, the insurance premiums for the manufacturing operations will become part of the product costs as the insurance premiums expire.)",what
How does the purchase of a new machine affect the profit and loss statement?,"The purchase of a new machine that will be used in a business will affect the profit and loss statement, or income statement, when the machine is placed into service. At that point, depreciation expense will begin and there will likely be other expenses such as wages, maintenance, electricity, and so on.
Since the income statement reports only the expenses that match the revenues during the accounting period, the depreciation expense might be very small in the first accounting period compared to the amount spent for the machine. For example, if the machine is purchased half way into the accounting year and its cost was $300,000, the depreciation for that first accounting period might be only $15,000—assuming it has a 10 year life and no salvage value. In the next accounting period the depreciation expense will be $30,000 under the straight-line method.
If the machine is used by a manufacturer, the depreciation, electricity, and maintenance of the machine will be recorded as manufacturing overhead. This overhead is then assigned to the products and will be held in inventory until the goods are sold. When the products are sold, these overhead costs will be reported on the income statement as part of the cost of goods sold.",what
What are gross sales?,"Gross sales are the amounts a company earned and recorded from the sales of its products (and perhaps its services). The amounts originate from the company's sales invoices but the total will be adjusted to the accrual basis at the end of each accounting period.
The gross sales amounts from the sales invoices are recorded in a general ledger account such as Sales. (Any sales returns, sales allowances, and sales discounts should be recorded in separate contra revenue accounts in order for management to see the magnitude of these items.)
Gross sales is also defined as the sales revenues before deducting the sales returns, sales allowances, and sales discounts. (Gross sales minus sales returns, sales allowances, and sales discounts is the definition of net sales.)
A review of the income statement for 19 publicly-traded corporations revealed that only the net amount of sales (or revenues) appeared on the face of the income statements.",what
Why would a company use double-declining depreciation on its financial statements?,"Most companies will not use the double-declining balance method of depreciation on their financial statements. The reason is that it causes the company's net income in the early years of an asset's life to be lower than it would be under the straight-line method.
One reason for using double-declining balance depreciation on the financial statements is to have a consistent combination of depreciation expense and repairs and maintenance expense during the life of the asset. In other words, in the early years of the asset's life, when the repairs and maintenance expenses are low, the depreciation expense will be high. In the later years of the asset's life, when the repairs and maintenance expenses are high, the depreciation expense will be low. While this seems logical, the company will end up reporting lower net income in the early years of the asset's life (as compared to the use of straight-line depreciation). Most managers will not accept reporting lower net income sooner than required.",what
What is turnover?,"Turnover is used in some countries to mean sales.
Turnover is also used in certain financial ratios. For example, the inventory turnover ratio is calculated by dividing the cost of goods sold during a year by the average inventory during the same year. The accounts receivable turnover ratio is computed by dividing the credit sales during a year by the average balance in Accounts Receivable during the same year.",what
What is the effective interest rate for a bond?,"A bond's effective interest rate is the rate that will discount the bond's future interest payments and its maturity value to the bond's current selling price (current market price or present value). The effective interest rate is a bond investor's yield-to-maturity. It is also referred to as the market interest rate. The effective interest rate will likely be different from the stated or contractual rate that appears on the face of the bond.
The accounting profession requires that significant amounts of bond discount or premium be amortized by using the effective interest rate. Under this method, the effective interest rate (at the time the bonds were issued) is multiplied times the bond's carrying value. The result is the amount of interest expense for each reporting period. The difference between this expense and the actual interest paid will be the amount of discount or premium that is being amortized during the reporting period. The effective interest rate method ensures that the interest expense on the income statement will be directly related to the bond amounts on the balance sheet.",what
Is the rental cost of a building considered overhead?,"The rental cost of a building used in manufacturing is part of manufacturing overhead. Manufacturing overhead is an indirect product cost. Indirect product costs are allocated or assigned to products on some reasonable basis. As a result, the rental cost of a manufacturing building will cling to the products manufactured. If the goods manufactured are in inventory, some of the rent of the manufacturing facility is in inventory. When a product is sold, the manufacturing rent that is included in the product cost will be part of the cost of goods sold.
The rental cost of a building that is not used for manufacturing (e.g. rent for a sales office, rent for the general administrative office) is not part of the manufacturing overhead. This rent does not cling to the products and will not be part of the cost of an item in inventory. The rent for nonmanufacturing facilities is immediately expensed in the accounting period when the building is rented.
If a rented building is used for both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing activities, the rent should be allocated to each (perhaps on the basis of square footage).",what
What is the profit margin (after tax) ratio?,"The after tax profit margin ratio tells you the profit per sales dollar after all expenses are deducted from sales. In other words, the after tax profit margin ratio shows you the percentage of net sales that remains after deducting the cost of goods sold and all other expenses including income tax expense. The calculation is: Net Income after Tax divided by Net Sales.
The before tax profit margin ratio expresses the corporation's income before income tax expense as a percentage of net sales.
The profit margin ratio is most useful when it is compared to 1) the same company's profit margin ratios from earlier accounting periods, 2) the same company's targeted or planned profit margin ratio for the current accounting period, and 3) the profit margin ratios of other companies in the same industry during the same accounting period.",what
"Under accrual accounting, how are worker comp premiums handled?","Worker comp insurance premiums should be charged to the areas where the related wages and salaries are charged.
Let's assume that the net cost of worker comp insurance after discounts and dividends is 5% of the wages and salaries of direct and indirect manufacturing employees. If for the month of January the direct labor is $40,000, then $2,000 of the worker comp cost should be included as direct labor. If indirect labor for January is $60,000 then $3,000 of worker comp cost should be included as the cost of the indirect labor.
If the general office worker comp rates are 0.2% of the general office wages and salaries, then 0.2% of January's general office wages and salaries will be expensed as worker comp insurance expense.
If the employer remits each month's worker comp cost to its insurance company each accounting period, there will be no prepaid insurance nor will there be a liability for accrued worker comp expense.
If the employer remits worker comp premiums to the insurance company in advance of the cost associated with wages and salaries, the amount that is prepaid as of the balance sheet date should be reported as Prepaid Insurance, a current asset. If the employer has remitted less than the worker comp cost associated with the wages and salaries, the amount owed to the insurance company as of the balance sheet date is reported as a current liability such as Accrued Worker Comp Payable.",what
Can absorption costing cause an increase in net income?,"Absorption costing could result in an increase in net income if a company increases its production and its inventory. This occurs because fixed manufacturing overhead is allocated to more production units—some of which will be reported as inventory.
To illustrate, let's assume that a company has no beginning inventory and it has production plans for 100,000 units. Let's also assume that its annual fixed manufacturing overhead is $600,000. If 100,000 units are produced, the fixed manufacturing cost per unit will be $6 ($600,000 divided by 100,000 units). If the 100,000 units are sold for $20 each, the income statement will report sales revenues of $2,000,000 and its cost of goods sold will include $600,000 of fixed manufacturing overhead.
Now let's assume that the company decides to produce 120,000 units even though sales are expected to remain at 100,000 units. Because the fixed manufacturing overhead remains at $600,000 the cost per unit for fixed manufacturing overhead will be $5 ($600,000 divided by 120,000 units produced). In this case the company will report the same sales revenues of $2,000,000 (100,000 units sold times $20) but its cost of goods sold will include only $500,000 of fixed manufacturing overhead (100,000 units sold times $5). The company's balance sheet account Inventory will include $100,000 (20,000 units times $5) of the company's fixed manufacturing overhead.
As was illustrated above, the income statement will report a lower cost of goods sold when production and inventory increased. A smaller cost of goods sold will mean more gross profit and more net income.

What is depletion?,"Depletion is the movement of the cost of natural resources from a company's balance sheet to its income statements. The objective is to match on the income statement the cost of the natural resources that were sold with the revenues of the natural resources that were sold. The cost of the natural resources sold is referred to as depletion expense.
Conceptually, depletion is similar to the depreciation of property, plant and equipment.",what
Why is interest expense a nonoperating expense?,"Interest expense is a nonoperating expense when it is not part of a company's main operations. For example, a retailer's main operations are the purchasing and sale of merchandise, and a manufacturer's main operations are the production and sale of goods.  Neither the retailer nor the manufacturer has as its main operations the borrowing and lending of money. (On the other hand, a bank's main operations involves interest expense on its depositors' savings accounts and interest revenues on its loans and bond investments.)
By reporting interest expense as a nonoperating expense, it also allows for a better comparison between the operating income of a retailer that has little debt with a retailer that has a significant amount of debt.",what
What is meant by events after the balance sheet date?,"Events after the balance sheet date are significant financial events that occur after the date of the balance sheet, but prior to the date that the financial statements are issued. For example, a company's balance sheet that has the heading of December 31, 2012 might not be finalized and distributed until February 1, 2013. During January new information may arise that has financial significance. Perhaps there is an event that provides more information about the conditions actually existing on December 31. The second type of event would be a new January event that does not change the December 31 amounts, but needs to be disclosed to the readers of the December 31 financial statements.
An example of the first situation might be that a customer owes Jay Company $200,000 on December 31 and Jay Company assumed that the customer was financially sound. As a result Jay Company did not provide any allowance for the customer's account being uncollectible. Then on January 28, the customer filed for bankruptcy and Jay Company learns that none of the $200,000 receivable will be collected. If the customer's financial condition on December 31 was already in bankruptcy condition, Jay Company will need to adjust its December 31 balance sheet and its income statement for the year 2012 for this $200,000 of bad debts expense.
An example of the second situation might be a loss arising from a catastrophe occurring on January 16, 2013. The amounts reported as of December 31, 2012 will not be adjusted since those amounts were correct as of December 31. However, the readers of the December 31 balance sheet and the 2012 income statement should be informed through a disclosure that something significant has occurred to the company's financial position since December 31.
The events after the balance sheet date are often referred to as subsequent events or post balance sheet events.",what
Is it acceptable for companies to use two methods of depreciation?,"Yes, many companies use two or more methods of depreciation.
It is acceptable and common for companies to depreciate its plant assets by using the straight line method on its financial statements, while using an accelerated method on its income tax return.
A company could also be depreciating its equipment over ten years for its financial statements, while using seven years for its income tax return.
Even the depreciation for financial statements could consist of some assets being depreciated using the units of production or units of activity method, while other assets are depreciated using the straight line method.",what
How do the income statements of a sole proprietorship and a regular corporation differ?,"The income statement of a sole proprietorship will not report any salary expense for the sole proprietor who works in the business. However, if the business is a regular corporation, the income statement will report as salary expense the amount that the stockholder earned by working in the business.
Another difference involves income tax expense. The income statement of a sole proprietorship will not report income tax expense, since the owner (and not the business) is responsible for U.S. income taxes. On the other hand, a regular corporation is a taxpaying entity and it is responsible for U.S. income taxes.
As a result of these two differences, the net income (which is the bottom line of the income statements) will be different. In the case of the sole proprietorship, the net income is the total amount that the owner has earned before income taxes for 1) the capital invested in the business and 2) the owner's compensation for working in the business. In the case of a regular corporation owned by one person, the owner has earned the salary (which was included in salary expense on the income statement) and has also earned the reported amount of net income or net loss.
Neither the draws made by the sole proprietor nor the dividends distributed by a regular corporation are reported on the income statement.",what
What is COS?,"In accounting, the acronym COS could indicate either cost of sales or cost of services.
The income statements of many retailers and manufacturers use the phrase cost of sales instead of cost of goods sold. In other words, for these corporations COS is the same as COGS.
The income statements of some service companies will use COS to mean the cost of services. Other service companies choose to report cost of revenues, while others will include their cost of services as part of operating expenses.",what
Where do I record the refund of a registration fee?,"If the registration fee refers to a fee expense that you had originally paid but the amount is now being refunded to you, I would credit the same expense account that you had originally charged or debited, and would debit Cash.
If the registration fee refers to an amount you are refunding because someone had originally registered for one of your programs, I would 1) credit Cash for the amount you are paying out as the refund, and 2) debit a contra-revenue account such as Refunds of Registration Fee Revenues. This will allow you to easily track the total amounts of refunds that you make during a year. On the other hand, if it is rare for your organization to refund registration fees, you could simply 1) debit the amount you are refunding to the normal revenue account such as Registration Fee Revenues, and 2) credit Cash.",what
Is the sale of a plant asset recorded in the sales account?,"The sale of a plant asset should not be recorded in the sales account. The sales account is used to report a retailer's sale of merchandise or a manufacturer's sale of products. In other words, sales result from a company's main revenue producing activities.
The sale of a plant asset is a ""peripheral"" activity and does not qualify as sales revenues. Rather, the gain or loss on a sale of a plant asset is reported on the income statement as a separate item. Often this item is included in a section labeled as ""other"" or ""nonoperating."" (The gain or loss is the difference between the proceeds from the sale of the plant asset and the plant asset's carrying value at the time of the sale.)
The proceeds from the sale of the plant asset is reported as a positive amount in the investing activities section of the statement of cash flows.",what
What is YOY?,"In financial analysis and data analytics, YOY is the acronym for year over year. YOY indicates the change from the comparable amount reported in the same period one year earlier. Below are three examples of YOY.
A retailer's sales for the first 5 weeks of the current fiscal year are $206,000, which is a 3% increase YOY. In other words, the sales in the first 5 weeks of this fiscal year are 3% greater than the sales in the first 5 weeks of the previous fiscal year. Based on this statement, the sales in the first 5 weeks of the previous fiscal year must have been $200,000. [$206,000 minus $200,000 is a $6,000 increase YOY. The $6,000 YOY increase divided by $200,000 is a 3% increase YOY.]
A church received contributions of $5,500 during Week #16 of its current year, which is a 10% increase YOY. In other words, the contributions during Week #16 of this year are 10% greater than those of Week #16 of the previous year (which must have been $5,000). [$5,500 minus $5,000 is a $500 increase YOY. The $500 increase divided by $5,000 is a 10% increase YOY.]
A website had 88,000 page views on the second Monday of January, which was a 12% decrease YOY. This means that the page views of the second Monday of January of the previous year were 100,000. [88,000 page views minus the previous year's 100,000 page views is a 12,000 decrease in page views YOY. The 12,000 decrease divided by 100,000 is a 12% decrease YOY.]",what
Why does an inventory error affect two periods?,"An inventory error affects two periods because 1) the ending inventory of one period will become the beginning inventory for the following period, and 2) the calculation of the cost of goods sold is beginning inventory + purchases – ending inventory.
We will demonstrate this with some amounts. Let's assume that a company began on December 1. During the month of December it purchased or manufactured $100,000 of goods. At the end of December 31, the company reported that its ending inventory was $15,000. As a result, its balance sheet will report inventory of $15,000 and its income statement will report cost of goods sold of $85,000. In January it purchases $130,000 of goods and at the end of January 31 it reports inventory of $20,000. It will report January's cost of goods sold as $125,000 (beginning inventory of $15,000 plus purchases of $130,000 minus ending inventory of $20,000).
Now let's assume that only one error occurred and it involved the calculation of the December 31 ending inventory. Instead of the $15,000 that had been reported, the true amount of inventory was $19,000. That meant the December 31 balance sheet understated the true cost of inventory by $4,000. It also meant that the income statement's cost of goods sold was not $85,000. Rather, the true cost of goods sold was $81,000 ($100,000 minus $19,000 of inventory). In January, the true cost of goods sold is $129,000 (beginning inventory of $19,000 plus the purchases of $130,000 minus the January 31 inventory of $20,000).
To recap, the December 31 balance sheet reported the incorrect ending inventory and the December and January income statements reported the incorrect cost of goods sold, and gross profit and net income. The true cost of goods sold for December was $81,000—not the $85,000 that was reported. The true cost of goods sold for January was $129,000—not the $125,000 that was reported. That one error in calculating the December 31 inventory cost resulted in December's cost of goods sold being too high and January's cost of goods sold being too low. That in turn meant that the reported gross profit for December was $4,000 too low and January's reported profit was $4,000 too high.",what
At what point are revenues considered to be earned?,"Revenues, which are derived from an entity's main activities such as the sale of merchandise or the performance of service, are considered to be earned when the earning process has been substantially completed.
For example, a merchandiser's sales revenues are considered earned when the goods have been shipped or delivered to the customers and the merchandiser has a right to a collectible accounts receivable. (Under accrual accounting it is not necessary to have received the cash in order to have earned the revenues.) The reason is that the substantial and difficult parts of the selling process (having the merchandise, finding customers, getting customers to place orders, and delivering the merchandise to customers) have been completed. Collecting the accounts receivable is usually an automatic process which requires little or no effort.
General guidance for determining when revenues are earned can be found in paragraphs 83 and 84 of the FASB's Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No. 5, Recognition and Measurement in Financial Statements of Business Enterprises and in an Intermediate Accounting textbook.",what
What are common-size financial statements?,"Common-size financial statements present the financial statement amounts as a percentage of a base number. For example, the common-size income statement will report the revenue and expense amounts as percentages of net sales. The common-size balance sheet will report each asset, liability, and owner equity amount as a percentage of total assets.
Common-size financial statements allow you to compare the financial statements of large companies with the financial statements of smaller companies, because you are comparing percentages instead of dollars. For example, a small retailer can compare her cost of goods sold (perhaps 78%) to a much larger retailer's cost of goods sold (perhaps 80%). Similarly, one company's inventory might be 33% (of total assets) while a competitor's might be 28%.
Common-size financial statements are related to a technique known as vertical analysis.",what
Why isn't a corporation's dividend shown on its income statement?,"A dividend paid by a corporation is a distribution of previously earned net income (profits). A dividend is not an expense or a loss. Therefore, dividends declared and/or paid are not part of the computation of net income that is presented on the income statement.
Dividends declared by corporations are reported in their statements of changes in Retained Earnings and Stockholders' Equity.",what
Where is a contract with a customer reported on the balance sheet?,"A contract to perform future services for a customer is not reported on the balance sheet of the company that will be providing the services.  For example, if Company Jay and one of its customers sign a contract in December agreeing that Company Jay will deliver $20,000 of services beginning in January, the contract is not reported on Company Jay's December 31 balance sheet. (If the customer makes a deposit of $3,000 at the time of signing the contract, the $3,000 will be recorded by Company Jay in December with a $3,000 debit to Cash and a $3,000 credit to the liability account Customer Deposits or Unearned Revenues. With no downpayment or advance payment in December, there is no entry recorded.)
The $20,000 contract is not reported as an asset on Company Jay's December 31 balance sheet. The reason is that Company Jay has not earned any of the contract amount and therefore does not have a right or a receivable to the $20,000 as of December 31. Similarly, Company Jay's income statement for December and its December 31 owner's equity cannot include any earnings associated with the contract.",what
What are consolidated statements of operations?,"Consolidated statements of operations is the heading appearing on the financial statement also referred to as the income statement. In a small survey of 14 U.S. corporations with stock that is publicly-traded, I found that eight used the title consolidated statements of operations. The other six corporations used one of the following titles: consolidated statements of income, consolidated statements of earnings, or consolidated results of operations. In the case of smaller corporations and sole proprietorships, you will more likely see the heading income statements. Seasoned business owners often refer to this financial statement as the P&L, which is short for profit and loss statement.
The word statements (instead of statement) is used in the heading because publicly-traded U.S. corporations are required to present the income statements for each of their most recent three accounting years.
The term consolidated is used in the heading of the financial statements when the corporation controls several separate legal entities but is reporting the results as one economic entity.",what
What is the definition of net sales?,"The definition of net sales is sales minus sales discounts, sales returns, and sales allowances.",what
What is the transaction approach and balance sheet approach to measuring net income?,"The transaction approach to measuring net income is the traditional bookkeeping and accounting method. That is, individual transactions such as each sale, each purchase, and every expense are recorded into general ledger accounts. At any point you can go to an account such as Salaries Expense for Sales Staff and see the year to date amount of such an expense. With the use of accounting software, an enormous quantity of transactions can be recorded into many detailed accounts.
I believe that the balance sheet approach is also referred to as the capital maintenance approach. Under the balance sheet approach one looks at the change in stockholders' or owner's equity to determine the amount of net income during the period between balance sheets. This approach requires that you exclude any additional capital from the owners as well as any dividends or withdrawals distributed to the owners. For example, if stockholders' equity increased by $5 million with $2 million caused by the issuance of new shares of stock, and $1 million distributed as dividends, the net income would have been $4 million. We can verify the calculation with the following:  net income of $4 (an addition to equity) plus new investor money of $2 (an addition to equity) = $6 of additions to equity, minus dividends of  $1 (a decrease to equity) = $5 (the net increase to equity). Under this balance sheet approach you will not have the detailed information on revenues and expenses that would be available under the transaction approach.",what
Is the depreciation of delivery trucks a period cost or is it manufacturing overhead?,"The depreciation on the trucks used to deliver products to customers is a period cost. The depreciation on delivery trucks will be reported as an expense on the income statement in the period in which it occurs. It might be reported as part of Selling Expenses or as part of Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses.
The depreciation on the trucks used to transport materials or work-in-process between the facilities of a manufacturer is a component of manufacturing overhead. In other words, the depreciation on trucks used in the manufacturing process is assigned to the goods produced rather than being expensed directly.",what
What is a natural business year?,"A natural business year is the period of 12 consecutive months (or 52-53 consecutive weeks) ending at a low point of an organization's activities. For example, a school district will have a natural business year of July 1 through June 30, since classes for the school year end in early June.
A retailer's natural business year might be the 52-53 consecutive weeks ending on the Saturday closest to each February 1. This is a low point of activity as it follows the retailer's holiday season and its January clearance sales. The 52-53 week periods (instead of 12 month periods) will result in an equal number of Saturdays in most of the natural business years (as well as in the 13-week quarters and in the 4-5 week months).
Many companies have a natural business year of January 1 through December 31. On the other hand, some companies are required by government regulations to end their accounting years on December 31, even though it is not the end of their natural business year.
The term fiscal year is associated with companies having financial reporting years that do not end on December 31.",what
What is a lease?,"A lease is usually a written agreement between an owner of property (land, building, equipment, vehicle, etc.) and a person or business that will use the property for a stated period of time at a specified series of payments.
The owner of the property is known as the lessor and the person using the property is the lessee.
Some leases are for short periods of time and there is no intention of transferring ownership of the asset in exchange for the rent payments. Two examples of this type of lease are 1) the lease for a one-bedroom apartment covering a 12-month period and rent payments of $1,100 per month, and 2) the lease of a new automobile for 24 months with payments of $300 per month.
Other leases may be for longer periods and ownership of the asset will transfer to the lessee for a small additional payment. An example is a noncancellable lease requiring 60 monthly payments of $600 per month for a forklift truck. At the end of the lease period (after the 60th payment) the lessee may take ownership of the forklift truck for an additional payment of $500.
Since leases are contracts requiring a series of payments, there is a question of how the lease and the related payments should be accounted for by the lessee and the lessor. As of September 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) were close to issuing a common financial accounting reporting standard that will replace the present U.S. accounting rules.",what
What is a comparative income statement?,"A comparative income statement will consist of two or three columns of amounts appearing to the right of the account titles or descriptions. For example, the income statement for the year 2012 will report the amounts for each of the years 2012, 2011, and 2010. As a courtesy to the reader, the amounts from the most recent period are in the column closest to the titles. The older amounts are deemed to be less significant and thus appear furthest from the titles.
A comparative income statement gives the reader a frame of reference for comparing the current year amounts.",what
Is depreciation an operating expense?,"Depreciation Could Be Either an Operating Expense or a Non-operating Expense
Depreciation is an operating expense if the asset being depreciated is used in an organization's main operating activities.
Depreciation is a non-operating expense if the asset being depreciated is used in a peripheral or incidental activity of an organization.
Examples of When Depreciation is an Operating Expense
Examples of depreciation being reported as part of the operating expenses on the income statement include:

Depreciation of a retailer's store displays, warehouse equipment, delivery truck, and buildings used in its selling and general administrative functions. The depreciation will be reported on the retailer's income statement in the section containing its SG&A expenses.
Depreciation of the equipment and building used in the manufacturer's selling and general administrative functions. This depreciation will be reported on the manufacturer's income statement in the section containing its SG&A expenses.
Depreciation of equipment and building used in the manufacturing of products. This depreciation will be allocated to the goods produced and is considered part of a product's indirect costs. In the period in which a product is sold, its cost (including its share of depreciation) will be reported as part of the cost of goods sold, which is likely to be the largest operating expense on a manufacturer's income statement.",what
How are period costs reported in the financial statements?,"Under the accrual method of accounting, period costs such as selling, general and administrative expenses are reported on the income statement in the accounting period in which they are used up or expire. They are referred to as period costs because they are not assigned to products, and therefore cannot be included in the cost of items held in inventory.
If a selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense is prepaid, the prepaid portion will be reported as a current asset. When the prepaid expense expires, it will move to the income statement and become part of that period's SG&A expenses.
Interest expense is also a period cost unless it is determined to be a necessary cost of a self-constructed, long-lived asset.",what
The balance sheet and income statement are connected.,"In the tip of April 20, I mentioned that adjusting entries almost always involve both a balance sheet account and an income statement account. (For example, the cost of supplies that are no longer on hand is moved from the balance sheet to supplies expense on the income statement. Insurance premiums that are no longer prepaid are moved from the balance sheet to insurance expense on the income statement.) The first accounting course teaches us that the basic accounting equation is Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity. Owner's Equity or Stockholders' Equity is a section of the balance sheet that increases when the company's net income increases.
The point of these observations is the following tip: The number of balance sheet accounts is usually small in relation to the number of income statement accounts. If you can be certain that the relatively few balance sheet accounts have the correct ending balances, you can have some confidence that the bottom line of the income statement is proper. (The income statement may contain errors—perhaps you entered an amount into the wrong account—but the overall net income has a good chance of being correct.)
I received this tip from a CPA named Bob many years ago, when he helped me to delegate some accounting work. I continue to value his insight.",what
Are the sales taxes part of a retailer's sales?,"No. The sales taxes collected by a retailer are not part of its sales revenues. This means that the sales taxes collected by a retailer will not be reported on its income statement. Rather, the sales taxes collected are reported on the balance sheet as a current liability until they are remitted to the government.
To illustrate, let's assume that all of a retailer's products are subject to a state sales tax of 6%. If the retailer sells $500 of merchandise for cash, it will collect $530. This will be recorded with 1) a debit to Cash for $530, 2) a credit to Sales for $500, and 3) a credit to Sales Taxes Payable for $30. Note that the Sales account did not include the $30 of sales taxes.
When the retailer remits the sales taxes to the government, the liability account Sales Taxes Payable will be debited.",what
What is the earnings per share (EPS) ratio?,"The earnings per share ratio, or simply earnings per share, or EPS, is a corporation's net income after tax that is available to its common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of shares of common stock that are outstanding during the period of the earnings.
Net income available for common stock is the corporation's net income after income taxes minus the required dividend for the corporation's preferred stock, if it has preferred stock outstanding.
Additional information on the calculations and presentation of a corporation's earnings per share are contained in the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings per Share. It can be read at no cost at www.FASB.org/st.",what
What is a deferred asset?,"A deferred asset represents costs that have occurred, but because of certain circumstances the costs can be reported as expenses at a later time. One of these circumstances is the assurance from an electric utility's regulators that the costs being deferred will be recoverable through increases in future utility rates.
To illustrate, let's assume that an electric utility spent $300,000 for a project before it had to be abandoned. The state regulators ruled that the utility may recover the $300,000 from its customers in the form of higher rates over a 5-year period starting next year. Because of this assurance, the utility can record the $300,000 as a deferred asset. In each of the five subsequent years, the utility will credit the deferred asset account for $60,000 and will debit an expense for $60,000. Hence, the $60,000 of increased expenses will be matched with the $60,000 of increased revenues on five annual income statements.
Deferred assets are also referred to as deferred charges, deferred costs, or deferred debits. For the example we used above, utilities will use the term regulatory assets.
The balance in a deferred asset account will be reported on the balance sheet as a current asset and/or as a noncurrent asset depending on the facts involved.",what
FIFO and LIFO is best with which type of products?,"Since FIFO and LIFO pertain to the flow of products' costs, I believe the answer involves the rate of change in the costs of products. In other words, if the costs of a company's products are steady, it won't matter whether a company uses FIFO or LIFO. The reason is that the first or older costs will be similar to the latest or recent costs. On the other hand, if the costs of its products are increasing significantly, there will be significant difference in profits and inventory values between FIFO and LIFO.
In the U.S., accountants often cite LIFO as the preferred method when products' costs are changing. The reason is the matching of the latest costs of products with the sales revenues of the current period. U.S. tax  rules also allow for either FIFO or LIFO, but require that the same cost flow assumption be used on both the company's tax return and on the company's financial statements.
By using LIFO when the costs of products are increasing, the company will be matching the recent higher costs with the current period sales. This will provide not only the improved matching of costs with revenues, it will also result in lower taxable income.",what
What is inflation accounting?,"In the U.S., inflation accounting has resulted in optional supplementary disclosures on the effects of 1) general inflation, and 2) changes in the prices of specific types of assets. In other words, the main financial statements continue to report only the traditional, historical cost amounts without any adjustment for changing prices. [During the years 1979 to 1985, some supplementary disclosures on the effects of changing prices had to be included in the notes to the financial statements of the very large U.S. corporations. From 1986 until today, the supplementary disclosures are optional. Hence, the disclosures are not likely to be made.]
One reason that inflation accounting is now optional for U.S. corporations is that the U.S. inflation rate has been modest or low since 1983. Another reason is the belief that the cost of computing the disclosure amounts will be greater than the benefit to the readers of the financial statements.
To illustrate the logic of inflation accounting, let's assume that the general inflation rate and the changes in the costs of specific assets are increasing at a constant rate of 10% each year. This means that a power plant built for a cost of $1 billion will cost $10 billion at the end of a useful life of 25 years. By computing straight-line depreciation based on the historical cost, the income statement will report depreciation expense of $40 million per year ($1 billion/25 years). Obviously this is much lower than the current cost of the productive capacity being used up each year.
Similarly, if a retailer's cost of items in inventory is increasing at an annual rate of 10%, the cost of goods sold reported on the income statement (based on historical costs) will be less than the cost the company will spend in order to replace the units sold.
The use of historical costs during periods of increasing prices means that companies with large amounts of plant assets and inventory will be reporting net income that is greater than the true economic profit. As a result, the reported net income during inflationary periods is said to include illusory profit.",what
"If a mortgage payment is due by December 31, but the payment is not made until the following month, should the loan payment be accrued at December 31?","The interest portion of the mortgage payment should be accrued as of December 31 under the accrual method of accounting. In other words, there needs to be an adjusting entry dated December 31 to debit Interest Expense and to credit Interest payable for the amount of interest owed as of December 31.
The principal balance on the mortgage loan already appears in the general ledger and on the balance sheet as the liability Mortgage Loan Payable. Therefore, there is no accrual needed for the principal portion of the loan payment due at December 31.",what
What is Form 10-K?,"Form 10-K is a corporation's annual report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Form 10-K is required for U.S. corporations whose stock is publicly traded.
Form 10-K contains a wealth of information on the corporation in general such as its products, sales, markets, risks, officers, directors, and more. A significant portion of the Form 10-K is entitled Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. Another major section is Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. You will learn much about the corporation and about accounting by reading a corporation's entire Form 10-K. (In other words, don't skip the notes to the financial statements.)
A corporation's Form 10-K is usually available from each corporation's website (usually under Investor Relations). You can also access and download the SEC reports at no cost from http://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/webusers.htm.",what
What is meant by nonoperating revenues and gains?,"Nonoperating revenues are the amounts earned by a business which are outside of its main or central operations. Nonoperating revenues are also described as incidental or peripheral. A common example is a retailer's investment income or interest income. The retailer's main operations are purchasing and selling merchandise. Investing its idle cash in interest-bearing investments is outside of its main or central operations.
Gains often involve the disposal of property, plant and equipment for a cash amount that is greater than the carrying amount (or the book value) of the asset sold. An example would be a retailer's disposal of a delivery truck for a cash amount that is greater than the truck's carrying amount. Another example is a gain from a settlement of a lawsuit.
Nonoperating revenues and gains are often reported on the income statement after the subtotal Income from operations and will often appear with the caption Other income.",what
Is the sales tax on merchandise purchased for resale included in inventory?,"In our state, sales tax is paid only by the end customer. In other words, a retailer does not pay sales tax on merchandise that is purchased for resale. To avoid the sales tax, the retailer furnishes the supplier with a reseller's certificate, which allows the supplier to not charge the sales tax.
If a sales tax is paid by the reseller and the sales tax could have been avoided, the sales tax would have to be expensed immediately. Costs that are not necessary cannot be recorded as assets.
If the sales tax could not have been avoided, then the sales tax would be part of the cost of the merchandise purchased. If the merchandise has not been sold, the entire cost will be reported as inventory, a current asset on the balance sheet. If the merchandise has been sold, then the entire cost will be reported on the income statement as the cost of goods sold.",what
What does the term organic growth mean?,"Organic growth often refers to the growth in a company's sales that did not occur because of an acquisition of another company. Expressed another way, organic growth is the internal growth or the growth from its existing businesses—not from the businesses it acquired during the period.
For example, a company's sales may have increased 25% during the past year. However, all of the sales increase was the result of having acquired a competitor. Therefore, it had no organic growth.",what
Is an automobile loan payment an expense?,"Only the interest portion of an automobile loan payment is an expense. The principal portion of the loan payment is a reduction of the loan balance, which is reported as a Note Payable or Loan Payable in the liability section of the balance sheet.
Expressed another way, an automobile loan payment consists of two components: an interest payment and a principal payment. While the loan payment is a cash outflow or an expenditure, only the interest portion is an expense that will be reported on a company's income statement.",what
What accounts for the difference in inventory values between periodic LIFO and perpetual LIFO?,"The difference between periodic LIFO and perpetual LIFO involves the time at which costs are removed from inventory. Under periodic LIFO, the latest costs are assumed to be removed from inventory at the end of the year. Under, perpetual LIFO the latest costs are assumed to be removed from inventory at the time of each sale.
We will illustrate the difference by using the following information. A company's accounting year is January 1 through December 31 and the company sells only one type of product. In its beginning inventory are 2 units with a cost of $10 each. The company sells 1 unit on March 1. On April 1, the company purchases 5 units at a cost of $11 each. On September 1, the company sells 3 units. In summary, the company had 2 units on January 1, purchased 5 units on April 1, sold 4 units during the year, and has 3 units on hand at December 31.
Under periodic LIFO, the costs of the latest purchases starting with the end of the year are removed first. Since 4 units were sold during the year, the costs removed from inventory and charged to the cost of goods sold will be the latest cost of 4 units, which is $11 each. This means the cost of its December 31 inventory under periodic LIFO will be $31 (1 unit at $11 plus 2 units at $10).
Under perpetual LIFO, the costs of the latest purchases as of the date of each sale are removed first. On March 1, the latest cost at that time for the 1 unit sold was $10. At the time of the sales on September 1, the latest costs of the 3 units sold was $11 each. Under perpetual LIFO its cost of goods sold will be $43 (1 at $10 and 3 at $11), and its inventory will be reported at a cost of $32 (2 units at $11 and 1 unit at $10).",what
Why do companies use cost flow assumptions to cost their inventories?,"Cost flow assumptions are necessary because of inflation and the changing costs experienced by companies. If costs were completely stable, it wouldn't matter how costs were flowed.
To illustrate the cost flow assumption, let's assume that a company's product had a cost of $100 at the start of the year, at mid-year the cost was $105, and at the end of the year the cost was $110. Which cost would you match with the sale of one item at the end of the year? Would you match the $100 cost with the selling price of the unit sold? (If so, you are assuming a FIFO cost flow.) Would you match the $110 cost with the sale? (That's the LIFO cost flow assumption.) If you would matched the average of $105, you would be using the weighted-average cost flow assumption.
The cost flow assumption will also affect the inventory values. If you matched the $100 cost with the sale, the company's inventory will have the higher costs. If you matched the $110 cost with the sale, the company's inventory will have lower costs. The weighted-average cost would mean that both the inventory and the cost of goods sold would be valued at $105 per unit.
You must also realize that the cost flow assumption is independent of the physical flow of the products. This means you can rotate your company's inventory (by selling its oldest units first) and yet flow the costs by using LIFO or weighted average.
Many U.S. companies have switched their cost flow assumption from FIFO to the LIFO because they were experiencing rising costs. By flowing the recent higher costs into the cost of goods sold on the income statement and tax return (and keeping the older lower costs in inventory), they are reporting a more realistic net income and less taxable income.",what
What does NOI stand for?,"NOI is the acronym for net operating income. Net operating income is also referred to as income from operations.
NOI excludes discontinued operations, extraordinary items, and nonoperating (or other) items such as interest expense, interest revenues, gains, and losses.",what
Are earnings different from profits?,"Earnings and profits are often used interchangeably. Others might make a distinction between the two words.
In the case of earnings per share, earnings means a corporation's net income after income tax expense. However, in another context the word earnings could mean an amount that is prior to income tax expense. Some people might use the word earnings to mean an amount before all expenses are considered.
Some people use the word profits to mean net income before income tax expense, while others use the word profits to mean net income after income tax expense. The term gross profit means sales minus the cost of goods sold.
Knowing that people might use terms differently, you may need to ask the person a question to clarify their intended meaning.",what
Are repairs to office equipment an expense?,"Repairing and maintaining office equipment is an immediate expense. This is true even if the repair cost is a very large amount.
If a large expenditure is made to improve office equipment, that cost would be recorded as an asset and then depreciated over the remaining life of the equipment.
Small expenditures to improve office equipment are usually expensed immediately because of the materiality concept. This means the amount is so small that no one will be misled by having the entire amount appear immediately as an expense rather than appearing as depreciation expense over several years. Often improvements of less than $500 or $1,000 are considered immaterial and are expensed immediately.",what
What does the cost principle mean for a company's income statement?,"If a company has buildings, equipment and inventory, the cost principle will mean that the amount of depreciation expense and the cost of goods sold expense will be based on the costs when the assets were acquired. If these assets have increased in value, the depreciation and cost of goods sold reported on the income statement will be less than the value of the economic capacity being used up. As a result, the reported net income will be greater than the economic reality.
To illustrate this point let's assume that the cost of a bank building was $10 million and was fully depreciated during its first 30 years of use. The cost principle requires the depreciation expense on the bank's income statement for year 31 (and each year thereafter) to be $0 even if the bank building's market value has doubled. Similarly, a manufacturer using equipment that is fully depreciated will have lower manufacturing overhead and lower cost of goods sold because the current year's depreciation for the equipment is $0.
Generally, the cost principle requires that only the verifiable, historical costs recorded at the time of transactions will appear as expenses on the income statement. Unfortunately those recorded costs may not measure the economic reality that is occurring in the period of the income statement.",what
What is the periodic inventory system?,"Definition of Periodic Inventory System
The periodic inventory system does not update the general ledger account Inventory when a company purchases goods to be resold. Rather than debiting Inventory, the company debits the temporary account Purchases. Any adjustments related to these purchases of goods will be credited to a general ledger contra account such as Purchases Discounts or Purchases Returns and Allowances. When the balances of these three purchases accounts are combined, the resulting amount is known as net purchases.
When goods are sold under the periodic inventory system there is no entry to credit the Inventory account or to debit the account Cost of Goods Sold. Hence, the Inventory account contains only the ending balance from the previous year. As a result, the company must compute an inventory amount at the end of each accounting period in order to report the amount of its ending inventory for its balance sheet and the cost of goods sold for its income statement.
Computing the Inventory Amount Under the Periodic Inventory Method
At the end of an accounting year, the company's ending inventory is normally computed based on a physical count of its inventory items. However, the inventory amounts for the monthly and quarterly financial statements are usually estimates. Under the periodic inventory system the cost of goods sold is computed as follows: beginning inventory (previous year's ending inventory cost) + net purchases = cost of goods available - costs computed for the ending inventory = cost of goods sold. An alternative format is: net purchases plus the decrease in inventory or minus the increase in inventory = cost of goods sold.
Inventory Records Outside of the General Ledger
It should be noted that companies using the periodic inventory system in their general ledger accounts often have sophisticated inventory systems outside of the general ledger for tracking the items it purchases, produces, sells and has on hand.",what
How do I record exterior cement work? Is it an asset or an expense?,"If the cement work was done to repair or maintain existing cement work, then the expenditure should be recorded as an expense. Even if the cost is very large, repairs and maintenance must be expensed. The cost of repairs or maintenance cannot be recorded as an asset.
If the cement work is an addition or an improvement (more than repairing or maintaining existing cement work), the cost of the cement work is viewed as a new asset. If the amount is significant, you should record the expenditure as an asset and then depreciate the cost over the useful life. However, if the amount of the addition or the improvement is relatively small, the accounting concept of materiality allows you to expense the entire amount immediately.",what
Is a utility bill an expense?,"The utility bill for a retailer or for a service company is an expense. Under the accrual basis of accounting, the utility bill is an expense for the period indicated by the meter reading dates.
A manufacturer's utility bill is more complicated. The utility bill for its selling and general administration will be an expense for the period indicated by the meter reading dates. However, the utility bill for the direct and indirect manufacturing operations is part of its manufacturing overhead. As such, the utility bill will be assigned or allocated to the units produced. In other words, the utility bill will be clinging to the units produced. Some of the utility cost will be clinging to the units in inventory and therefore will be part of the cost of the asset inventory. Some of the utility cost will be clinging to the units that have been sold and will be part of the expense known as the cost of goods sold.",what
What are external financial statements?,"The external financial statements of a U.S. corporation should consist of a complete set of the following:

income statement (statement of earnings, statement of operations)
statement of comprehensive income
balance sheet (statement of financial position)
statement of cash flows (cash flow statement)
statement of stockholders' equity (statement of shareholders' equity, statement of equity)
notes to the financial statements

These financial statements become ""external"" when they are distributed to people and organizations not involved in the corporation's operations. Some examples of external users are current investors and lenders, potential investors and lenders, financial analysts, certain government agencies, credit rating organizations, certain customers and suppliers, and others.
Since the external financial statements are likely to be compared to those of other corporations (and to previously issued financial statements), it is imperative that standardized rules be followed. In the U.S. these common rules are known as generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which are established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).",what
Are income taxes affected by accelerated depreciation?,"Using accelerated depreciation on the income tax return will mean greater depreciation expense and smaller taxable income in the earlier years of an asset's life. However, it will be followed by smaller depreciation expense and greater taxable income in the later years of the asset's life.
For a corporation with consistent taxable income, the use of accelerated depreciation on the income tax return instead of the straight-line method, will defer some income tax until the later years of an asset's life. Over the entire life of the asset, the total depreciation expense is the same. The methods merely affect the timing of the depreciation.
It is also important to note that a corporation may use the straight-line method on its financial statements and at the same time use accelerated depreciation on its income tax returns. The differences in income taxes resulting from using different methods are referred to as timing differences or temporary differences.
You can learn more about the reporting of income taxes caused by timing and temporary differences by reading the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, available at www.FASB.org/st.",what
"If we dispose of an asset, will there be a change in the owner's equity?","The owner's equity of a sole proprietorship will change only if the disposal of an asset causes a gain or loss to be reported on the income statement.
To illustrate this, let's assume that a truck that was used in the business is sold for $5,000. If the truck had a cost of $40,000 and accumulated depreciation of $35,000 there will be no gain or loss reported on the income statement. The reason is the $5,000 received is equal to the $5,000 of book value that is being removed from the balance sheet. With no gain or loss on the disposal, the owner's equity is unchanged.
On the other hand, if the same truck is sold for $3,000 there will be a $2,000 loss ($3,000 of cash received versus the $5,000 of book value removed) reported on the income statement. When the account Loss on Disposal of Assets is closed, the owner's capital account will be reduced by the $2,000 loss.",what
Where do preferred stocks go on the P&L?,"The amount received from issuing preferred stock is reported on the balance sheet within the stockholders' equity section.
Only the annual preferred dividend is reported on the income statement. The annual preferred dividend requirement is subtracted from a corporation's net income and the remainder is described as the Income Available for Common Stock.",what
"Why can a retailer record its purchase of merchandise as a debit to purchases within the cost of goods sold, instead of the asset inventory?","Before we explain why companies will record the purchases of merchandise in the Purchases account instead of the Inventory account, let's agree that the objective of the accounting process is to have accurate financial statements. In this case we want an income statement which reports an accurate amount of cost of goods sold, and the resulting gross profit and net income. We need the balance sheet to report an accurate cost of inventory, and the resulting amount of current assets, working capital, total assets, and stockholders' equity. I believe this objective will require some type of an adjustment to the the Inventory account balance and to the cost of goods sold regardless of how the purchases of merchandise were initially recorded.
Now for the reason companies often record purchases in a purchases account. Generally, companies will have a relatively stable amount of inventory and the cost of its annual purchases will be many times the cost of its inventory. This means that most of the cost of its purchases will appear as the cost of goods sold on its income statement. For the minor change in the cost of inventory from the beginning to the end of the accounting period, an adjustment can be made. For example, let's assume that the cost of purchases during the year amounted to $560,000. Let's also assume that the inventory at the end of the year has a cost of $70,000 compared to the inventory cost of $67,000 at the end of the previous accounting year. An adjustment will be entered to debit the Inventory account for $3,000 which will increase the Inventory account balance from $67,000 to $70,000. The credit portion of the entry of $3,000 will cause the cost of goods sold to be reported as $557,000 ($560,000 of debits in the Purchases account during the year minus the amount that increased the cost of inventory: $3,000). After this adjustment, the balance sheet will report the true cost of the ending inventory of $70,000 and the income statement will report the true cost of goods sold of $557,000.",what
What is a permanent account?,"Definition of Permanent Account
In accounting, a permanent account refers to a general ledger account that is not closed at the end of an accounting year. The balance in a permanent account is carried forward to the subsequent year, where it becomes the beginning balance for the new year.
Permanent accounts are also known as real accounts.
Examples of Permanent Accounts
Generally, the balance sheet accounts are permanent accounts, except for the owner's drawing account which is a balance sheet account and a temporary account. (The owner's drawing account is a temporary account because its balance is closed to the owner's capital account at the end of each year in order to begin the next year with a $0 balance.) 
Examples of permanent accounts are:

Asset accounts including Cash, Accounts Receivable, Inventory, Investments, Equipment, and others
Liability accounts such as Accounts Payable, Notes Payable, Accrued Liabilities, Deferred Income Taxes, etc.
Owner's (Stockholders') equity accounts including Owner's Capital, Common Stock, Retained Earnings, and others",what
What is EBIT?,"EBIT is the acronym for earnings before interest and taxes. In other words, EBIT is a corporation's net income assuming it had no interest expense and no income tax expense. (Since the amount of earnings is based on the net income reported on the income statement, a corporation's other comprehensive income is not considered.)
A corporation's EBIT could be the same as its operating income. However, if the corporation has nonoperating revenues and/or gains and/or certain losses, the EBIT will differ from operating income.
EBIT is not a GAAP metric but EBIT may facilitate the comparison of companies' operating results for the following reasons:

Some corporations are Subchapter S Corporations which do not report corporation income tax expense
Some corporations are C Corporations which do report corporation income tax expense
Some corporations have significant debt and therefore report significant interest expense
Some corporations have little or no debt and therefore report little or no interest expense",what
Will the adjusting entry amounts appear in the balance sheet and income statement?,"Absolutely. The adjusting entry amounts must be included on the income statement in order to report all revenues earned and all expenses incurred during the accounting period indicated on the income statement. The adjusting entry amounts must also be included in the amounts reported on the balance sheet as of the end of the accounting period.
In the following accounting period, the accrual-type adjusting entries will usually be reversed. They are reversed or removed because the actual invoices or other documents containing the accrued revenues or expenses will be arriving and will be entered into the accounting records by the bookkeeper or the accounts payable clerk.",what
What is operating income?,"Definition of Operating Income
Operating income is defined as a corporation's operating revenues minus its operating expenses.
Operating income will be shown as a subtotal on many corporations' income statements. The amount of operating income is shown before the provision for income tax and before investment income, interest expense, or other non-operating income or expense items.
Operating income is also reported as income from operations, operating earnings, or operating profit. 
Major Components of Operating Income
The operating revenues are often described as net sales, while the operating expenses will include the cost of goods sold, selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A), and perhaps impairment charges. Some of the SG&A expenses may appear as separate amounts such as depreciation and amortization, and research and development.",what
What is EBITDA?,"EBITDA is the acronym for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.

What is a condensed income statement?,"A condensed income statement is one that summarizes much of the income statement detail into a few captions and amounts.
For example, a retailer's condensed income statement will summarize hundreds of categories of sales into one amount with the description Net Sales. Its detailed purchases and changes in inventory will be presented as one amount with the description Cost of Goods Sold. Perhaps thousands of operating expenses will be presented as one amount with the description Selling, General and Administrative, or SG&A.
The readers of a condensed income statement will be able to easily and quickly focus on the company's net income and its key components.",what
What is the cost of goods available?,"Definition of Cost of Goods Available
For non-manufacturing companies using the periodic inventory system in its general ledger, the cost of goods available (COGA, or cost of goods available for sale) for a year is the sum of the following: the costs in the beginning inventory (the prior year's ending inventory) + the cost of the current year's net purchases.
Allocating Cost of Goods Available to Inventory and Cost of Goods Sold
At the end of the year, the cost of goods available amount must be allocated or divided between:

Products or goods that are in ending inventory. This allocated amount will be reported on the end-of-the-year balance sheet.
Products or goods that have been sold during the year. This allocated amount will appear on the income statement for the year as cost of goods sold (COGS).

The allocation of the total amount of COGA between ending inventory and COGS will differ depending on a company's cost flow assumption. Three examples of cost flow assumptions are:

FIFO which assigns the recent unit costs of the purchases to inventory and the oldest unit costs to COGS.
LIFO which assigns the recent unit costs of the purchases to COGS and the oldest unit costs will remain in inventory.
Weighted-average which calculates a weighted-average unit cost based on each and all of the units in the COGA and then applies those unit costs to both the units in inventory and the units that have been sold.",what
Why is a product that sells for $50 reported in inventory at its cost of $40?,"Generally, items in inventory are valued at their cost—not their selling prices—because of the cost principle.
Another reason for not valuing items in inventory at their selling prices is that inventory items cannot be sold without a sales effort. Until that effort is made and an item is actually sold, the company cannot report the $10 increase from $40 to $50. This is referred to as the revenue recognition principle. In other words, only after an item is actually sold can the company report the revenue of $50 minus the cost of $40 for a gross profit of $10.
There are some exceptions to reporting inventory at cost. One exception is industries where no sales effort is required and the extensive effort of production has been completed. In these industries the inventory may be reported at its net realizable value, which is the sales value minus the costs to dispose of the items. The gold mining industry and certain other commodities are examples.
Another exception to reporting inventory at cost occurs in any industry when a product will have to be sold for less than its cost. In that situation the item should normally be reported at its net realizable value. (U.S. income tax rules require conformity between tax and financial reporting. As a result, there are complexities involved.)",what
What are gains?,"Definition of Gains
In financial accounting, gains often pertain to some of a company’s transactions which occur outside of the company’s main business activities. Transactions which are outside of a company’s main business activities are referred to as nonoperating activities. 
Gain vs Operating Income
Let's assume that a company is a retailer whose main business activities are the purchasing and reselling of merchandise. When the retailer sells $5,000 of merchandise that it had purchased at a cost of $3,000, the retailer’s income statement will report sales of merchandise of $5,000 and cost of goods sold of $3,000. The difference of $2,000 is part of the retailer's gross profit, operating income, and net income. The word ""gain"" is not appropriate since the activities involved the normal business activities of the retailer.
However, if the same retailer sells its old delivery van, this transaction is outside of the retailer’s main business activities of purchasing and selling merchandise. Therefore, the sale of the van will not be included with the sales of merchandise. Instead, a gain (or loss) will be reported as one of the company’s nonoperating items often under the heading of other income.
Calculating a Gain
To illustrate the calculation of a gain, let’s assume that the retailer sells its old van for $5,000 cash. At the time of the sale the van is on the retailer’s books at $3,500 (which consists of its original cost of $20,000 and accumulated depreciation of $16,500). Since this transaction is not a main business activity of the retailer and since the $5,000 of cash received is greater than the net cost of $3,500 being removed from the accounts, the retailer will report a nonoperating item described as gain on sale of van of $1,500. 
More Examples of Gains
Other examples of gains that could appear on a company’s income statement include:

Gain on sale of investments
Gain on sale of building
Gain on legal settlement
Gain on early extinguishment of debt",what
What is a defined benefit pension plan?,"A defined benefit pension plan is a retirement plan in which the employer commits to paying a specified monthly payment to each eligible employee when he or she retires at a stated age. The monthly benefit is often based on a formula such as a percentage for each year of employment times the employee's average monthly salary or wages during a three-year period prior to retirement. A hypothetical calculation for an employee retiring at age 65 might be 1% X 30 years of service X $4,000 per month average salary = $1,200 per month pension check.
Under the defined benefit pension plan, the employer commits to depositing enough money into a pension fund in order to cover the future benefits. Since there is uncertainty in the investment returns, the life expectancy of retirees, and other factors, the employer's ongoing contributions, pensions expense, and net income are uncertain. This risk has resulted in the decline of defined benefit pension plans and has increased the popularity of defined contribution pension plans.",what
What is a defined contribution pension plan?,"A defined contribution pension plan is one in which the employer contributes an amount into each eligible employee's account within an established plan. The employee decides on the investment strategy for the account and the resulting investment earnings, gains, or losses are recorded in his or her account. When the employee retires, the pension or retirement benefit is based upon his or her account balance. A 401(k) is an example of a defined contribution pension plan.
The defined contribution pension plan eliminates the employer's uncertainty about its future pension expense and liabilities. It also means simpler accounting. As a result, more companies are choosing defined contribution pension plans over defined benefit pension plans.",what
Should a retailer's delivery surcharges be reported as revenues or as other income?,"I believe that a retailer's delivery surcharges are a price adjustment and should be reported as operating revenues. The surcharges are operating revenues that will be matched with the higher operating expenses such as gasoline. The delivery surcharges should not be reported as nonoperating revenues or other income. Nonoperating revenues or other income items would be outside the main activities of the retailer and would include items such as interest earned or the gain on the sale of a plant asset.
The retailer can record the delivery surcharges in a separate operating revenue account. In other words the sales revenues account could be used to record the revenues excluding the surcharges and then another sales revenue account could be designated as the delivery surcharge revenues account. Those two accounts would then be added together to report total operating revenues.",what
What is a controller's cushion?,"A controller's cushion or controller's reserve involves temporarily recording too much expense for an item that the controller calculates. For example, the controller might budget $48,000 per year for depreciation and then record $4,000 of actual depreciation expense for each month. However, the controller expects the actual depreciation to be only $44,000 for the year.
For the first eleven months, the financial statements will report $44,000 of depreciation expense. Then in the 12th and final month of the year no depreciation expense is recorded. This means that depreciation expense will beat its budget by $4,000 ($44,000 of actual depreciation versus the annual budget of $48,000). This favorable $4,000 is the controller's cushion. The idea is that this will cushion the effects of some unexpected expenses or losses that come to light at the end of the accounting year.
The controller's reserve or controller's cushion is related to a concept known as budgetary slack.",what
What does it mean to recognize an expense?,"Definition of Recognize an Expense
To recognize an expense means to report the proper amount of an expense on the income statement for the appropriate accounting period.
When and How to Recognize an Expense

When there is a cause-and-effect relationship between a company's revenues and some of its expenses, these expenses should appear on the same income statement as the associated revenues. Accountants describe this as matching expenses with revenues. For instance, a company's sales of products which are properly reported on its July income statement will cause the related expense known as the cost of goods sold to be reported/recognized on the July income statement. If the company's sales reps have earned commissions on the July sales, these commissions should also be recognized/reported as Commissions Expense on the company's July income statement (regardless of when the company pays the commissions).
If a cause-and-effect relationship does not exist between a company's revenues and its costs, and there is no future economic benefit which can be measured, the costs should be recognized/reported immediately as expenses on the current income statement. A few examples include advertising, office salaries, interest on most loans, and research and development costs.
When a cost has a future economic benefit which can be measured, the accountant should report the cost as an asset. Then as the future benefit expires (is used up) the cost should be systematically recognized/reported as an expense on the appropriate income statements. Some examples include the expensing of prepaid insurance premiums and the depreciation of assets used in the company's business.

Use of Adjusting Entries
Companies use adjusting entries in order for their income statements and balance sheets to be reporting the proper amounts in the appropriate accounting periods under the accrual method of accounting.",what
What are generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)?,"Definition of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
Generally accepted accounting principles (commonly referred to as GAAP or US GAAP) are the common accounting rules that must be followed when a U.S. company prepares financial statements that will be distributed to people outside of the company. 
These common rules range from basic underlying principles and assumptions to the detailed rules established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) for complex financial transactions. The FASB has organized the generally accepted accounting principles in its Accounting Standards Codification (ASC).
Why Generally Accepted Accounting Principles are Required?
Generally accepted accounting principles are required so a knowledgeable reader of financial statements is able to do the following:

Compare a company's current financial statements to the earlier financial statements of the same company
Compare a company's financial statements to those of other companies (especially within the same industry)
Understand how a company recognizes/reports revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, etc.

Examples of the Basic Underlying Accounting Principles
The basic underlying accounting principles consist of the following:

Economic entity assumption
Going concern assumption
Time period assumption
Monetary unit assumption
Cost principle or measurement principle
Matching principle or expense recognition principle

What is Subchapter S?,"Subchapter S refers to a section of Chapter 1 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code.
A subchapter S corporation, which is also referred to as an S corporation, is a corporation that does not pay the income taxes on its income. Rather, the owners of the S corporation are responsible for the income taxes which pertain to their share of the S corporation's income. Hence, the income statement of an S corporation does not report income tax expense, and the balance sheet does not report income taxes payable.
There are certain requirements in order to elect the Subchapter S status. Learn more about Subchapter S corporations at www.IRS.gov or from a tax professional.",what
What is net sales?,"Definition of Net Sales
Under the accrual basis of accounting, net sales is the total amount of goods shipped/delivered to customers during a specified period of time minus any early payment discounts (if offered by the seller) and minus allowances for goods returned by customers, adjustments to the sales invoice amounts, etc. 
Does Sales Include Sales Tax?
The amount of a company's sales does not include the sales taxes collected by the seller. The reason is that the sales taxes included in the sales invoices are not revenues earned by the seller. Instead, the sales taxes are the state/local government's revenues. The seller is merely acting as an agent that is required to collect and remit the sales taxes to the government.
As a result, the sales taxes included in a company's sales invoices are recorded in a current liability account such as Sales Taxes Payable. When the company remits the sales taxes to the state or local government, the balance in Sales Taxes Payable is reduced. Any unremitted balance in Sales Taxes Payble is reported in the current liability section of the company's balance sheet.
Sales vs Net Sales
Assume that a company has sales invoices for the month amounting to $63,000. The sales invoices represent the goods shipped to customers and includes $1,000 of sales taxes pertaining to its retail customers. The company offers credit terms of 1/10, net 30 days and some customers paid within 10 days and were granted early payment discounts of $300. The company also granted allowances of $200 to customers who received damaged goods or had been given a price adjustment.
Given the above information, the company's sales are calculated as follows:
Sales invoices with a total of $63,000 minus $1,000 of sales taxes that were included as required by the state/local government = the company's sales of $62,000. Sales are also referred to as gross sales.
The company's net sales are calculated as follows:
Sales (or gross sales) of $62,000 minus early payment discounts of $300 and sales allowances of $200 = the company's net sales of $61,500.",what
Weekly Income Statement,"When I became a director of a meatpacking company, I was concerned about the thin profit margins, the corporation's lack of working capital, and my inexperience in the industry.
The company slaughtered cattle from Tuesday through Saturday. By Monday the products were shipped and the coolers were empty–what a perfect time to measure the profits for the seven day period that just ended. I suggested that we establish the workweek for payroll to be Tuesday though Monday and we replace the monthly income statement with a weekly income statement for this seven-day period. Our payroll service had the payroll processed by Wednesday evening and the next day we could review the company's profit for the week that ended just three days earlier. One manager's eyes lit up and he shared his excitement about no longer waiting until July 20 to see an income statement for the month of June.
The weekly statements were not only more timely, they were easier to prepare when it came to inventory and payroll. (When the company had monthly income statements and the month ended on a Wednesday, the company would have inventory of live cattle and products to be accounted for. The weekly payroll would have to be divided between months.) The cost of cattle was the largest cost, but that cost was available for each day, since cattle had to be paid for within 24 hours of purchase. It would be much easier getting the cattle information on a Monday when the plant was not operating. Of course we had to estimate utilities and supplies used during the seven-day period, but we also had to estimate those expenses when we prepared monthly financial statements.
Not only did we adopt weekly financial statements, we adopted an accounting and tax year that ended on the last Monday in January. We also prepared ""monthly"" financial statements that covered the four or five weeks ending on the last Monday of each month.
It wasn't long before the owner took the one-week income statement further. He started computing daily income statements in his head.",what
What is a calendar year?,"Definition of Calendar Year
A calendar year is the 12 consecutive months from January through December. In other words, it is the 365 days (366 days in a leap year) beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31.
Example of Calendar Years
In the U.S., individuals file their personal income tax returns based on the calendar year of January 1 through December 31. Many U.S. corporations also have accounting and income tax years that coincide with the calendar year of January 1 through December 31. However, U.S. corporations may have an accounting year and income tax year that is not a calendar year. 
Examples of Non-calendar Years
If a U.S. corporation has a non-calendar accounting year, it is referred to as a fiscal year.
An example is a U.S. retailer whose financial statements report the amounts for the fiscal year covering the 52-week period of Sunday, February 4, 2018 through Saturday, February 3, 2019. 
Often educational institutions have fiscal years that begin on July 1 and end on the following June 30.",what
What is the cost of goods sold?,"Definition of Cost of Goods Sold
The cost of goods sold is the cost of the products that a retailer, distributor, or manufacturer has sold.
The cost of goods sold is reported on the income statement and should be viewed as an expense of the accounting period. In essence, the cost of goods sold is being matched with the revenues from the goods sold, thereby achieving the matching principle of accounting.
When the cost of goods sold is subtracted from net sales, the result is the company's gross profit.
Examples of Calculating the Cost of Goods Sold
One way to calculate a retailer's cost of goods sold is to begin with the cost of the goods it had purchased during the accounting period and then adjust it for the change in inventory. For example, if 1,000 units of a company's only product were purchased but its inventory increased by 100 units, then the cost of 900 units will be the cost of goods sold. If 1,000 units of the product were purchased but the inventory decreased by 100 units then the cost of 1,100 units will be the cost of goods sold.
Using dollar amounts, let's assume that a retailer's cost of its merchandise purchases for a year was $300,000 while the cost of its inventory increased from $100,000 to $120,000. The result is that its cost of goods sold is $280,000 (purchases of $300,000 minus the $20,000 increase in inventory).
A second way to calculate the cost of goods sold is: the cost of the beginning inventory + the cost of goods purchased = cost of goods available - cost of ending inventory. Using the amounts above, we have $100,000 + $300,000 = $400,000 - $120,000 = $280,000.
If the cost of the ending inventory were $65,000, the cost of goods sold would have been $335,000 (purchases of $300,000 + the $35,000 decrease in inventory). 
Cost Flow Assumption Is Needed
When costs change during the accounting period, a cost flow will have to be assumed. Some common cost flow assumptions include FIFO, LIFO, and average.",what
What is the significance of FOB Shipping Point and FOB Destination?,"Significance of FOB Shipping Point and FOB Destination
The terms FOB shipping point and FOB destination have significance in accounting because they determine the following:

When a sale of goods and the related receivable occur
When the purchase of goods and the related liability occur
Whether the seller or buyer pays the shipping costs

If the seller of goods quotes a price that is FOB shipping point, the sale takes place when the seller puts the goods on a common carrier at the seller's dock. Therefore, when the goods are being transported to the buyer, they are owned by the buyer and the buyer is responsible for the shipping costs.
If a seller of goods quotes a price that is FOB destination, the sale takes place when they are unloaded at the buyer's destination. This means that the seller owns the goods while they are on the truck and the seller is responsible for the shipping costs.
Example of FOB Shipping Point
Assume that a seller quoted a price of $900 FOB shipping point and the seller loaded the goods onto a common carrier on December 30. Also assume that the goods are in transit until they arrive at the buyer's location on January 2. On December 30, the seller should record a sale, an account receivable, and a reduction in its inventory.
The buyer should record the purchase, the account payable, and the increase in its inventory as of December 30 (the date that the purchase took place). Since the goods on the truck belong to the buyer, the buyer should pay the shipping costs. These shipping costs will be an additional cost of the goods purchased.
Example of FOB Destination
Now assume that a seller quoted $975 FOB destination and the seller loaded the goods onto a common carrier on December 30. Also assume that the goods are on the truck until January 2, when they are unloaded at the buyer's location. On December 31, the goods were owned by the seller. Therefore, the seller should continue to report these goods in its inventory until January 2. The seller will be responsible for the shipping costs, which will be an expense in January when the sale is reported.
The buyer records the purchase, accounts payable, and the increase in inventory on January 2 when the buyer becomes the owner of the goods.",what
What is the difference between gross margin and markup?,"Definition of Gross Margin
Gross margin or gross profit is defined as net sales minus the cost of goods sold. 
However, some people intend for the term gross margin to mean the gross margin as a percentage of sales (or percentage of selling price). Others will use the term gross margin ratio to mean the gross margin as percentage of sales or selling price.
Example of Gross Margin
If a retailer sells a product for $10, and its cost was $8, the gross profit or gross margin is $2. 
The gross margin ratio is 20%, which is the gross profit or gross margin of $2 divided by the selling price of $10.
Definition of Markup
Markup in dollars is the difference between a product's cost and its selling price. [Note: some retailers may use the term markup to mean an additional markup from an earlier selling price.]
The markup is also expressed as a percentage of cost (not selling price).
Example of Markup
Assume that a product has a cost of $8 and the seller sets a selling price of $10. In dollars, the markup is $2 (the same as the $2 gross profit).
However, the markup is usually expressed as a percentage of the product's cost (not its selling price). Therefore, the $2 markup divided by the product's cost of $8 results in a markup that is 25% of cost.
Thus, if a retailer wants its income statement to show a gross profit that is 20% of sales, the retailer must mark up its products' costs by 25%.",what
What is the cost of sales?,"Definition of Cost of Sales
Cost of sales is often a line shown on a manufacturer's or retailer's income statement instead of cost of goods sold.
The cost of sales for a manufacturer is the cost of its finished goods in its beginning inventory plus the cost of goods manufactured during the accounting period minus the cost of finished goods in ending inventory.
The cost of sales for a retailer is the cost of merchandise in its beginning inventory plus the net cost of merchandise purchased during the accounting period minus the cost of merchandise in its ending inventory.
The cost of sales does not include selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, or interest expense.",what
How do you compute a selling price if you know the cost and the required gross margin?,"Definition of Selling Price
A selling price is the amount that a customer will pay to buy a product. If a retailer wants to earn a positive gross margin (or gross profit percentage), the selling price must include an additional amount that is added to the retailer's cost of the product. This additional amount must be sufficient to cover the retailer's selling, general and administrative expenses and some profit.
Example of Computing a Selling Price
Let's use the following information:

SP represents the Selling Price that the customer will pay
C represents the retailer's cost of the product
GP$ represents the product's Gross Profit in dollars
GM represents the product's Gross Margin
SP - C = GP$

If a retailer wants to earn a GM of 40%, it means that the GM needs to be 40% of SP, or 0.4SP. Therefore, the product's SP = C + 0.4SP.
Let's assume that a retailer's cost of a product is $100, thus CP = $100. This means that SP = $100 + 0.4SP. Restating this we have 0.6SP = $100. Which means SP = $166.67. 
Now let's verify that the selling price of $166.67 is correct. A selling price of $166.67 minus its cost of $100.00 equals a gross profit of $66.67. The gross profit of $66.67 divided by the selling price of $166.67 = a gross margin of 40%.",what
What is the difference between product costs and period costs?,"A manufacturer's product costs are the direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead used in making its products. (Manufacturing overhead is also referred to as factory overhead, indirect manufacturing costs, and burden.) The product costs of direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead are also ""inventoriable"" costs, since these are the necessary costs of manufacturing the products.
Period costs are not a necessary part of the manufacturing process. As a result, period costs cannot be assigned to the products or to the cost of inventory. The period costs are usually associated with the selling function of the business or its general administration. The period costs are reported as expenses in the accounting period in which they 1) best match with revenues, 2) when they expire, or 3) in the current accounting period. In addition to the selling and general administrative expenses, most interest expense is a period expense.",what
What is absorption costing?,"Definition of Absorption Costing
Absorption costing (or full absorption costing) indicates that all of the manufacturing costs have been assigned to (or absorbed by) the units produced. In other words, the cost of a finished product will include the costs of:

direct materials
direct labor
variable manufacturing overhead
fixed manufacturing overhead

Absorption costing is required for external financial reporting and for income tax reporting.
Another method of costing (known a direct costing or variable costing) does not assign the fixed manufacturing overhead costs to products.
Standard Costing: Fixed Manufacturing Overhead Variances
Standard Costing: Variable Manufacturing Overhead Variances",what
What is the gross margin ratio?,"Definition of Gross Margin Ratio
The gross margin ratio is a percentage resulting from dividing the amount of a company's gross profit by the amount of its net sales. (The gross margin ratio is also known as the gross profit margin or the gross profit percentage or simply the gross margin.)
Companies should be continuously monitoring its gross margin ratio to be certain it is sufficient to cover its selling, general and administrative expenses, interest expense, and to earn a profit.
Example of Gross Margin Ratio
To illustrate the gross margin ratio, let's assume that a company has net sales of $800,000 and its cost of goods sold is $600,000. As a result, its gross profit is $200,000 (net sales of $800,000 minus its cost of goods sold of $600,000) and its gross margin ratio is 25% (gross profit of $200,000 divided by net sales of $800,000).
Note: Gross margin ratios vary between industries. Therefore, you should compare a company's gross margin ratio to other companies in the same industry and to its own past ratios or its planned ratios.",what
What is cost accounting?,"Definition of Cost Accounting
Cost accounting is involved with the following:

Determining the costs of products, processes, projects, etc. in order to report the correct amounts on a company's financial statements, and
Assisting management in the planning and control of the organization
Preparing special analyses that assists in making the best decisions

Examples of Cost Accounting
A significant part of cost accounting involves the unit cost of a manufacturer's products in order to report the cost of inventory on its balance sheet and the cost of goods sold on its income statement. This is achieved with techniques such as the allocation of manufacturing overhead costs and through the use of process costing, operations costing, and job-order costing systems.
Cost accounting assists management to plan and control the business through budgeting for operations, capital budgeting for expanding operations, standard costing and the reporting of variances, transfer pricing, etc.
Special analyses includes cost behavior, cost-volume-profit relationships, make or buy decisions, selling prices for products, activity-based costing, and more.
Cost accounting had its roots in manufacturing businesses. However, today it extends to service businesses. For example, a bank will use cost accounting to determine the cost of processing a customer's check and/or a deposit, maintaining a checking account, processing international wire transfers, servicing a mortgage loan, etc. This in turn may provide management with guidance in the pricing of various services.",what
What is job order costing?,"Definition of Job Order Costing
Job order costing or job costing is a system for assigning and accumulating manufacturing costs of an individual unit of output. The job order costing system is used when the various items produced are sufficiently different from each other and each has a significant cost. (When a company's output consists of continuous flows of identical, low-cost units, the process costing system is more appropriate.)
Since there is a significant variation in the items manufactured, the job order costing system requires a separate job cost record for each item (or each job or special order). The job cost record will report each item's direct materials and direct labor that were actually used and an assigned amount of manufacturing overhead.
The job cost records also serve as the subsidiary ledger or documentation for the manufacturer's cost of the work-in-process inventory, the finished goods inventory, and the cost of goods sold.
Examples of Job Order Costing
A few examples of the use of job order costing are:

A company that designs and produces custom-made machines and/or machine tooling
A company that constructs custom-designed buildings
A company that modifies trucks to meet customers' special needs",what
How do I calculate the cost of goods sold for a manufacturing company?,"Calculation of the Cost of Goods Sold for a Manufacturer
The calculation of the cost of goods sold for a manufacturing company is:

Beginning Inventory of Finished Goods
Add: Cost of Goods Manufactured
Equals: Finished Goods Available for Sale
Subtract: Ending Inventory of Finished Goods
Equals: Cost of Goods Sold",what
How do you calculate the cost of carrying inventory?,"Definition of Cost of Carrying Inventory
The cost of carrying inventory (or cost of holding inventory) is the sum of the following:

Cost of money tied up in inventory, such as the cost of capital or the opportunity cost of the money.
Cost of the physical space occupied by the inventory including rent, depreciation, utility costs, insurance, taxes, etc.
Cost of handling the items.
Cost of deterioration and obsolescence.

Often the costs are computed for a year and then expressed as a percentage of the cost of the inventory items. Others may focus on the incremental costs of carrying or holding inventory.
The cost of carrying inventory will vary from company to company. For instance, if a company has a large cash balance with no attractive investment options, has excess space for storage, and its products have a low probability for deterioration or obsolescence, the company's holding or carrying costs are very low. A company with enormous debt, little space, and products subject to deterioration will have very high holding costs.
Example of Calculating the Cost of Carrying Inventory
Based on the above items, let's assume that a company's holding costs add up to 20% per year. If the company's inventory has a cost of $300,000 the cost of carrying or holding the inventory is approximately $60,000 per year.",what
What are conversion costs?,"Definition of Conversion Costs
Conversion costs is a term used in cost accounting that represents the combination of direct labor costs and manufacturing overhead costs. In other words, conversion costs are a manufacturer's product or production costs other than the cost of a product's direct materials. 
Expressed another way, conversion costs are the manufacturing or production costs necessary to convert raw materials into products.
The term conversion costs often appears in the calculation of the cost of an equivalent unit in a process costing system.
Examples of Conversion Costs
An example of direct labor are the employees working on the assembly line of a manufacturer.
Examples of manufacturing overhead include the utilities, indirect labor, repairs and maintenance, depreciation, etc. that is occurring within a company's manufacturing facilities.",what
What is the cost of goods manufactured?,"Definition of Cost of Goods Manufactured
The cost of goods manufactured is a calculation of the production costs of the goods that were completed during an accounting period. In other words, it includes the costs of direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead that are included in the products that moved from the manufacturing area to the finished goods inventory during the accounting period. The calculation is presented as a schedule or statement.
Example of the Cost of Goods Manufactured
The formula and format for presenting the cost of goods manufactured is:

The cost of the direct materials used 
PLUS the cost of the direct labor used 
PLUS the cost of manufacturing overhead assigned
EQUALS = the manufacturing costs incurred in the current accounting period
PLUS the cost of the beginning work-in-process inventory
MINUS the cost of the ending work-in-process inventory

The cost of goods manufactured is similar to a retailer's cost of goods purchased. Hence a manufacturer's cost of goods sold is computed as:

The cost of the beginning finished goods inventory
PLUS the cost of the goods manufactured
MINUS the cost of the ending finished goods inventory

The cost of goods manufactured is covered in detail in a cost accounting course. In addition, AccountingCoach PRO includes a form for preparing a schedule of the Cost of Goods Manufactured.",what
Are transportation-in costs part of the cost of goods sold?,"Definition of Transportation-in Costs
Transportation-in costs, which are also known as freight-in costs, are part of the cost of goods purchased. The reason is that accountants define ""cost"" as all costs necessary to get an asset in place and ready for use.
If a company purchases goods with terms such as FOB shipping point, the company will be responsible for any costs to get the products from the seller to the company's warehouse. In that situation, the company using the periodic system will likely have a purchases account entitled Transportation-in or Freight-in. (If goods are purchased with terms of FOB destination, the buyer will not have a separate transportation-in cost, because the seller is responsible for the costs of getting the goods to the buyer's location.) 
Transportation-in costs should be allocated or assigned to the products purchased. Therefore, the unsold products in inventory should include a portion of the transportation-in costs. The products that have been sold, should have their share of the transportation-in costs in the cost of goods sold).
Example of Transportation-in Costs
Let's assume that a bookstore purchases 20 copies of a bestselling book for $20 each and the terms are FOB shipping point. The shipping cost to get the books from the publisher to the bookstore amounts to $40. Therefore, this transportation-in cost of $40 amounts to $2 per book, resulting in a cost per book of $22. If 16 books are sold, the cost of goods sold will be $352 (16 X $22) and the inventory cost of the remaining 4 books will be $88 (4 X $22). In total, the bookstore had purchases of $400 + transportation-in cost of $40, resulting in the cost of goods available of $440. When we subtract the $88 cost of inventory, there is $352 as the cost of goods sold.",what
What are operating expenses?,"Definition of Operating Expenses
Operating expenses are the costs that have been used up (expired) as part of a company's main operating activities during the period shown in the heading of its income statement.
Examples of Operating Activities
Examples of a retailer's main operating activities involve the buying and selling of merchandise or goods. Therefore, the retailer's income statement will report the following operating expenses:

Cost of goods sold. These costs are reported as operating expenses on the income statement because of the matching principle: The cost of the merchandise that is sold is being matched with the revenues from selling the goods.
Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A). These costs are reported as operating expenses on the income statement because they pertain to operating the main business during that accounting period. These costs are expenses because they may have expired, may have been used up, or may not have a future value that can be measured.

Some authors define operating expenses as only SG&A. In other words, they do not include the cost of goods sold as an operating expense. Such a definition will be deficient when measuring a company's operating income. Clearly, the calculation of operating income cannot omit the cost of goods sold.",what
What should be the entry when goods are purchased at a discount?,"Definition of Goods Purchased at a Discount
There are two common types of discounts for companies buying goods to resell:

Trade discount
Early payment discount

Examples of Entries for Goods Purchased at a Discount
Trade discount. Some suppliers have catalogs with prices before any discounts. Let's assume that the supplier gives companies that purchase a high volume of goods a trade discount of 30%. A small volume buyer receives only a 10% discount. If a high volume company purchases $40,000 of goods, its cost will be $28,000 ($40,000 X 70%). To comply with the cost principle the company will debit Purchases (or Inventory) for $28,000 and will credit Accounts Payable for $28,000.
Early payment discount. Some suppliers offer discounts of 1% or 2% from the sales invoice amount, if the invoice is paid in 10 days instead of the usual 30 days. For instance, let's assume that a company purchases goods and the supplier's sales invoice is $28,000 with terms of 1/10, net 30. This means that the company can deduct $280 (1% of $28,000) if it pays the invoice within 10 days. Otherwise, the company must pay $28,000 within 30 days. The early payment discount is also referred to as a purchase discount or cash discount.
If the company pays the supplier's invoice within 10 days, there are two ways to record the early payment discount of $280:

Gross method. At the time goods are received: debit of $28,000 to Purchases, credit of $28,000 to Accounts Payable. At the payment date within 10 days: debit of $28,000 to Accounts Payable, credit of $27,720 to Cash, credit of $280 to Purchases Discounts (a contra account to Purchases)
Net method. (This method is used less often and only if the company has the resources to always pay within the discount period.) At the time the goods are received: debit of $27,720 to Purchases, credit of $27,720 to Accounts Payable. At the payment date within 10 days: debit $27,720 to Accounts Payable, credit $27,720 to Cash. [If the company fails to pay the invoice within the discount period, the payment will be a debit of $27,720 to Accounts Payable, a debit of $280 to Purchase Discounts, a credit to Cash for $28,000. Purchase Discounts Lost is an income statement account.]",what
How do you report a write-down in inventory?,"Definition of Write-down in Inventory
Under FIFO and average cost methods, when the net realizable value of inventory is less than the cost of the inventory, there needs to be a reduction in the inventory amount. Often the balance in the current asset account Inventory is reduced through a credit to a contra inventory account, which is referred to as a valuation account. The debit in the entry to write down inventory is recorded in an account such as Loss on Write-Down of Inventory, which is an income statement account.
Example of Reporting a Write-down in Inventory
Under FIFO and average cost methods, if the net realizable value is less than the inventory's cost, the balance sheet must report the lower amount. If the amount of the Loss on Write-Down of Inventory is relatively small, it can be reported on the income statement as part of the cost of goods sold. If the amount of the Loss on Write-Down of Inventory is significant, it should be reported as a separate line on the income statement.
Since the amount of the write-down of inventory reduces net income, it will also reduce the amount reported on the balance sheet for owner's equity or stockholders' equity. Thus, the balance sheet and the accounting equation will show a reduction in inventory and in owner's or stockholders' equity.",what
Why and how do you adjust the inventory account in the periodic method?,"Definition of Inventory Account in Periodic Method
Under the periodic method or periodic system, the account Inventory is dormant throughout the accounting year and will report only the cost of the prior year's ending inventory. The current year's purchases are recorded in one or more temporary accounts entitled Purchases. At the end of the accounting year, the beginning balance in the account Inventory must be changed so that it reports the cost (or perhaps lower than the cost) of the ending inventory.
Examples of Adjusting the Inventory Account
When using the periodic method, balance in the inventory account can be changed to the ending inventory's cost by recording an adjusting entry.
To illustrate, let's assume that the cost of a company's beginning inventory (last year's ending inventory) was $35,000. This balance will be the only amount in the account Inventory until the end of the year. Let's assume that at the end of the year a physical count of inventory is taken and it has an actual cost of $40,000. To adjust the Inventory account balance from a debit balance of $35,000 to a debit balance of $40,000, the following adjusting entry will be needed:

Debit Inventory for $5,000, and
Credit Inventory Change for $5,000

Let's also assume that the Purchases account showed a debit balance of $200,000 for the year.
The account Inventory Change is an income statement account that when combined with the amount in the Purchases account will result in the cost of goods sold. In our example, the $5,000 credit balance in the account Inventory Change will reduce the $200,000 of Purchases, resulting in the cost of goods sold of $195,000 ($200,000 of purchases minus the $5,000 of purchases that were not sold and caused inventory to increase). 
As an additional example, let's assume that in the following year the company's ending inventory has a cost of $29,000. However, the inventory account has the debit balance of $40,000 from the prior year. This situation will require the following adjusting entry:

Credit Inventory for $11,000, and
Debit Inventory Change for $11,000

Let's also assume that the Purchases account showed a debit balance of $230,000 for the year.
The debit balance of $11,000 in the account Inventory Change when combined with the debit balance of $230,000 in the Purchases account will result in the cost of the goods sold of $241,000 ($230,000 of purchases plus $11,000 that was sold from inventory). 
Textbooks may change the balance in the account Inventory (under the periodic method) through the closing entries. (One closing entry removes the amount of beginning inventory and one closing entry records the cost of the ending inventory.) We believe that an adjusting entry is more logical and efficient, especially when a company's monthly and year-to-date financial statements are prepared using accounting software.",what
Are salaries and wages part of expenses on the income statement?,"Definition of Salaries and Wages
Salaries and wages are forms of compensation paid to employees of a company.
Salaries and Wages as Expenses on Income Statement
Salaries and wages of a company's employees working in nonmanufacturing functions (e.g. selling, general administration, etc.) are part of the expenses reported on the company's income statement. Under the accrual method of accounting, the amounts are reported in the accounting period in which the employees earn the salaries and wages.
Salaries and Wages of Employees in Manufacturing
At a manufacturing company, the salaries and wages of employees in the manufacturing operations are assigned to the products manufactured. When the products are sold, the costs assigned to those products (including the manufacturing salaries and wages) are included in the cost of goods sold, which is reported on the income statement. (The costs of the products that are not sold are reported as inventory on the balance sheet. Hence, the inventory will contain some of the manufacturing salaries and wages.
The salaries and wages of people in the nonmanufacturing functions such as selling, general administrative, etc. are reported directly on the current income statement as expenses in the period in which they were earned by the employees.",what
What is the days' sales in inventory ratio?,"Definition of Days' Sales in Inventory
The financial ratio days' sales in inventory tells you the number of days it took a company to sell its inventory during a recent year. Keep in mind that a company's inventory will change throughout the year, and its sales will fluctuate as well. Therefore, you should view this as an average from the past.
The calculation of the days' sales in inventory is: the number of days in a year (365 or 360 days) divided by the inventory turnover ratio.
Example of Days' Sales in Inventory
To illustrate the days' sales in inventory, let's assume that in the previous year a company had an inventory turnover ratio of 9. Using 360 as the number of days in the year, the company's days' sales in inventory was 40 days (360 days divided by 9). Since sales and inventory levels usually fluctuate during a year, the 40 days is an average from a previous time.
It is important to realize that a financial ratio will likely vary between industries. Hence, a company's ratios should be compared to its own past financial ratios and to the ratios of companies within its industry.",what
What is the monthly close?,"Definition of Monthly Close
In accounting, monthly close is a series of steps and procedures that are followed so that a company's monthly financial statements are in compliance with the accrual method of accounting.
Since a company's business activities are ongoing, accountants might state ""we need to get a proper ""cut-off"" between the end-of-the-month transactions and those that belong in the following month.
If a company sells goods and has inventories, its monthly close will be more challenging. The company must be certain that the costs of the goods purchased are recorded in the same month as the goods are added to the inventories.
Reviewing the financial statements before they are distributed is also an important step in the monthly close. This could mean comparing the amounts and percentages on the current financial statements to those of earlier months. For example, if the current income statement shows the cost of goods sold as 86% instead of the normal 81%, the current month's amounts should be investigated before releasing the financial statements.",what
Why Does Inventory Get Reported on Some Income Statements?,"Reporting of Inventory on Financial Statements
Inventory is an asset and its ending balance is reported in the current asset  section of a company's balance sheet. Inventory is not an income statement account.
However, the change in inventory is a component in the calculation of the Cost of Goods Sold, which is often presented on a company's income statement.
An increase in inventory will be subtracted from a company's purchases of goods, while a decrease in inventory will be added to a company's purchase of goods to arrive at the cost of goods sold. 
[Rather than simply showing the change in inventory as an adjustment to cost of goods, some income statements will show the calculation of Cost of Goods Sold as Beginning Inventory + Net Purchases = Goods Available - Ending Inventory.]
Example of Presenting the Cost of Goods Sold Calculation
Assume that a company's beginning inventory was $100 and its ending inventory was $110, which is an increase of 10. Let's assume that a company purchased $1,000 of goods during the accounting period. A common method of presenting the calculation of the cost of goods sold on the income statement is: Purchases of $1,000 minus the increase in inventory of $10 = $990. It is common for textbooks to show this calculation of the cost of goods sold on an income statement: Beginning Inventory of $100 + Purchases of $1,000 = Cost of Goods Available of $1,100 - Ending Inventory of $110 = $990. Hence, both presentations show the cost of goods sold of $990.
Recap
Again, inventory is a current asset that is reported on the balance sheet. The change in inventory is used to adjust the amount of purchases in order to report the cost of the goods that were actually sold. If some of the purchases were added to inventory, they are not part of the cost of goods sold.",what
What is gross profit?,"Definition of Gross Profit
Gross profit is defined as net sales minus the cost of goods sold.
Gross profit is sometimes referred to as gross margin. (However, gross margin can also mean the gross profit expressed as a percentage of net sales.)
Gross profit is presented on a multiple-step income statement prior to deducting selling, general and administrative expenses and prior to nonoperating revenues, nonoperating expenses, gains and losses.
Example of Gross Profit
Let's assume that a manufacturer has net sales of $60,000 and its cost of goods sold (using absorption costing) is $39,000. Therefore, the manufacturer's gross profit is $21,000 ($60,000 minus $39,000). The gross profit ratio or gross profit percentage is 35% (gross profit of $21,000 divided by net sales of $60,000).",what
What is the difference between periodic and perpetual inventory systems?,"Periodic Inventory System
In a periodic system the account Inventory:

Has only the ending balance from the previous accounting year
Excludes the cost of purchases, purchases returns and allowances, etc. since these are recorded in accounts such as Purchases, Purchases Returns and Allowances, Purchases Discounts, etc.
Must be adjusted at the end of the accounting year in order to report the costs actually in inventory
Requires a physical inventory at least once per year and estimates within the year
Requires a cost flow assumption (FIFO, LIFO, average)

The periodic inventory system requires a calculation to determine the cost of goods sold.
Perpetual Inventory System
In a perpetual system the account Inventory:

Is debited whenever there is a purchase of goods (there is no Purchases account)
Is credited for the cost of the items sold (and the account Cost of Goods Sold is debited
Has a continuously or perpetually changing balance because of the above entries
Requires a physical inventory to correct any errors in the Inventory account
Requires a cost flow assumption (FIFO, LIFO, average)

With the perpetual inventory system, the cost of goods sold is readily available in the account Cost of Goods Sold.
[It is possible that a company uses the periodic system in its general ledger, but uses a different computer system outside of its general ledger to track the flow of goods in and out of inventory.]",what
What is the difference between cost and expense?,"Definition of Cost
A cost might be an expense or it might be an asset. 
Definition of Expense
An expense is a cost that has expired or was necessary in order to earn revenues. The matching principle guides accountants as to when a cost will be reported as an expense. 
Example of a Cost
A company's property insurance bill for the next six months of insurance shows a cost of $6,000. Initially the cost of $6,000 is reported as the current asset Prepaid Insurance (or Prepaid Expense) since the cost has not been used up (has not expired).
Example of an Expense
As a prepaid cost such as the $6,000 in the asset account Prepaid Insurance expires, the part that expires will be reported on the income statement as Insurance Expense. If the insurance cost is expiring at a rate of $1,000 per month, then each month the amount in the asset account Prepaid Insurance will decrease by $1,000 and Insurance Expense of $1,000 will be reported on the income statement.",what
What is net realizable value?,"Definition of Net Realizable Value
Net realizable value (NRV) is the cash amount that a company expects to receive. Hence, net realizable value is sometimes referred to as cash realizable value.
We often find the term net realizable value being associated with the current assets accounts receivable and inventory. While these two assets are initially recorded at cost, there are occasions when the company will collect less than the cost. When that occurs, the company must report the lower of 1) cost, or 2) the net realizable value. 
In the case of accounts receivable, net realizable value can also be expressed as the debit balance in the asset account Accounts Receivable minus the credit balance in the contra asset account Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts. 
In the context of inventory, net realizable value is the expected selling price in the ordinary course of business minus any costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.
Examples of Net Realizable Value
If Accounts Receivable has a debit balance of $100,000 and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts has a proper credit balance of $8,000, the resulting net realizable value of the accounts receivable is $92,000. Adjustments to the Allowance account are reported on the income statement as bad debts expense.
Now, let's assume that a company's inventory has a cost of $15,000. However, at the end of the accounting year the inventory can be sold for only $14,000 after it spends $2,000 for packaging, sales commissions, and shipping. Therefore, the net realizable value of the inventory is $12,000 (selling price of $14,000 minus $2,000 of costs to dispose of the goods). In that situation the inventory must be reported at the lower of 1) the cost of $15,000, or 2) the NRV of $12,000. In this situation, the inventory should be reported on the balance sheet at $12,000, and the income statement should report a loss of $3,000 due to the write-down of inventory.",what
What is the difference between gross profit margin and gross margin?,"Definition of Gross Profit
Gross profit is an amount that is computed as follows:

A company's net Sales minus its cost of goods sold
A product's selling price minus the product's cost

Gross profit is the amount before deducting the following expenses: selling, general, administrative, interest, and income tax.
Definition of Gross Profit Margin
Gross profit margin is also referred to as the gross profit percentage or gross margin ratio. In that situation the calculation is:

A company's gross profit divided by the company's net sales
A product's gross profit margin divided by the product's selling price

Definition of Gross Margin
Some use the term gross margin to mean exactly the same as gross profit. Perhaps they want to avoid the word profit  since the selling, general, administrative, and interest expense have not yet been considered.
Others will use the term gross margin to mean the gross profit margin or gross profit percentage or gross margin ratio.
Example of Gross Profit, Gross Profit Margin and Gross Margin
Assume that in its most recent year a company had net sales of $80,000 and cost of goods sold of $60,000. As a result, the company had a gross profit of $20,000 ($80,000 minus $60,000) and a gross profit margin of 25% ($20,000 divided by $80,000). Some people will say the company had a gross margin of $20,000 while others will say the company had a gross margin of 25%. Others might say the company had a gross margin ratio of 25%.",what
What is interest expense?,"Definition of Interest Expense
Interest expense is the cost of borrowing money during a specified period of time. Interest expense is occurring daily, but the interest is likely to be paid monthly, quarterly, semiannually, or annually.
Example of Interest Expense
Let's assume that a company uses the accrual basis of accounting. If the company borrows $100,000 on December 15 and agrees to pay interest on the 15th day of each month at the rate of 1% per month, the interest expense for the month of December will be approximately $500 ($100,000 x 1% x 1/2 month). The interest expense for the month of January will be $1,000 ($100,000 x 1%).
In this example, as of December 31 no interest has been paid on the loan that began on December 15. However, the company did incur one-half month of interest expense. Therefore, the company needs to record an accrual adjusting entry that debits Interest Expense for $500, and credits Interest Payable for $500.",what
Where is a contingent liability recorded?,"Recording a Contingent Liability
A potential or contingent liability that is both probable and the amount can be estimated is recorded as 1) an expense or loss on the income statement, and 2) a liability on the balance sheet. 
Disclosing a Contingent Liability
A loss contingency which is possible but not probable will not be recorded in the accounts as a liability and a loss. Rather, it will be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
A loss contingency that is probable or possible but the amount cannot be estimated means the amount cannot be recorded in the company's accounts or reported as liability on the balance sheet. Instead, the contingent liability will be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. 
Not Reporting or Disclosing a Contingent Liability
A loss contingency that is remote  will not be recorded and it will not have to be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. An example is a nuisance lawsuit where there is no similar case that was ever successful.
Example of Recording a Contingent Liability
Product warranties are often cited as a contingent liability that meets both of the required conditions (probable and the amount can be estimated). Product warranties will be recorded at the time of the products' sales by debiting Warranty Expense and crediting to Warranty Liability for the estimated amount.",what
What are manufacturing costs?,"Definition of Manufacturing Costs
Manufacturing costs are the costs of materials plus the costs to convert the materials into products. All manufacturing costs must be assigned to the units produced in order for a company's external financial statements to comply with U.S. GAAP.
The resulting unit costs are used for inventory valuation and for the calculation of the cost of goods sold.
Example of Manufacturing Costs
Manufacturing costs are typically divided into three categories: 

Direct materials, which is the cost of the materials that are traceable to the product, such as the aluminum in beverage cans
Direct labor , which are the wages and fringe benefits earned by the individuals who are physically involved in converting raw materials into a finished product
Manufacturing overhead, which includes all of the other costs incurred in the manufacturing activities. These indirect costs include repairs and maintenance, depreciation of the manufacturing equipment, utilities, salaries of manufacturing supervisors, etc.",what
What is a trade discount?,"Definition of Trade Discount
A trade discount is a routine reduction from the regular, established price of a product. The use of trade discounts allows a company to vary the final price based on each customer's volume or status.
Note that trade discounts are different from early-payment discounts. (Early-payment discounts of 1% or 2% are usually recorded by the seller in an account such as Sales Discounts and by the buyer using the periodic inventory method in an account such as Purchase Discounts.) Trade discounts are not recorded in a separate account by either the seller or the buyer.
Example of Trade Discounts
A distributor of merchandise may have a single catalog which displays a single price for each product. However, the distributor allows a trade discount from the catalog price based on each customer's volume. For example, one product may have a catalog price of $100. A casual buyer will be charged $100. However, a reseller will be given a trade discount of 20% from the catalog price, and will be charged $80. Lastly, a registered high-volume wholesaler will be given a trade discount of 27% and will be charged $73.
Recording Sales Having a Trade Discount
The company selling the product (and the buyer of the product) will record the transaction at the amount after the trade discount is subtracted. For example, when goods with list prices totaling $1,000 are sold to a wholesaler that is entitled to a 27% trade discount, both the seller and the buyer will record the transaction at $730. There will not be a general ledger account entitled Trade Discount.",what
Is the cost of goods sold an expense?,"Why the Cost of Goods Sold is an Expense
We often think of expenses as salaries, advertising, rent, commissions, interest, and so on. However, the cost of goods sold is also an expense that must be matched with the related sales. Hence, a company's operating income is its operating revenues minus the cost of goods sold and its sales, general and administrative expenses.
The FASB's Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No. 6, Elements of Financial Statements, paragraph 81, states that ""...expenses themselves are in many forms and are called by various names—for example, cost of goods sold, cost of services provided, depreciation, interest, salaries and wages...."" You can read the concepts statements at www.FASB.org/st.",what
What is an equivalent unit of production?,"Definition of Equivalent Unit of Production
An equivalent unit of production is an expression of the amount of work done by a manufacturer on units of output that are partially completed at the end of an accounting period. Basically the fully completed units and the partially completed units are expressed in terms of fully completed units.
Equivalent units are used in the production cost reports for the producing departments of manufacturers using a process costing system. Cost accounting textbooks are likely to present the cost calculations per equivalent unit of production under two cost flow assumptions: weighted-average and FIFO.
Example of Equivalent Units of Production
Assume that a manufacturer uses direct labor continuously in one of its production departments. During June, the department began with no units in inventory and then started and completed 10,000 units. In addition, it started 1,000 units but they were only 30% complete at the end of June. The production cost report for this department will indicate that it manufactured 10,300 (10,000 + 300) equivalent units of product during June.
If the department's direct labor cost was $103,000 during the month, it's June direct labor cost per equivalent unit will be $10 ($103,000 divided by 10,300 equivalent units). This means that $100,000 (10,000 X $10) of labor costs will be assigned to the finished units and $3,000 (300 equivalent units X $10 labor cost per equivalent unit) will be assigned to the 1,000 partially completed units.",what
What is inventory?,"Definition of Inventory
Inventory is a very significant current asset for retailers, distributors, and manufacturers. Inventory serves as a buffer between 1) a company's sales of goods, and 2) its purchases or production of goods.
Companies strive to find the proper amount of inventory so that it can meet the fluctuating demand of its customers, avoid disruptions in production, and minimize holding costs.
Since the costs of the items purchased or produced are likely to change (especially with inflation), companies must elect a cost flow assumption for valuing its inventory and its cost of goods sold. In the U.S. the common cost flow assumptions are FIFO, LIFO, and average.
A company's cost of inventory is related to the company's cost of goods sold that is reported on the company's income statement.
Examples of Inventories
Retailers and distributors are likely to have one type of inventory, namely merchandise.
Manufacturers will have three or four categories of inventories:

Raw materials
Work-in-process
Finished goods
Manufacturing and packaging supplies

Manufacturers are required to report the amounts of each inventory category on its balance sheet or in the notes to the financial statements.",what
What is inventory change and how is it measured?,"Definition of Inventory Change
Inventory change is the difference between the amount of last period's ending inventory and the amount of the current period's ending inventory.
Under the periodic inventory system, there may also be an income statement account with the title Inventory Change or with the title (Increase) Decrease in Inventory. This account is presented as an adjustment to purchases in determining the company's cost of goods sold. 
Example of Inventory Change
Let's assume that last year's ending inventory was $100,000 and the current year's ending inventory is $115,000. Under the periodic inventory system, this inventory increase of $15,000 could be recorded as a debit of $15,000 to Inventory (thereby increasing the account balance from $100,000 to $115,000, and as a credit of $15,000 to Inventory Change.
Next, assume that the company's net purchases for the year amounted to a net debit of $300,000. This $300,000 debit and the credit of $15,000 in Inventory Change results in the cost of goods sold of $285,000. The logic is that not all $300,000 of net purchases should be matched against sales since $15,000 of the purchases were added to inventory. (This is an alternative to the method used in introductory accounting textbooks, which is: beginning inventory of $100,000 + net purchases of $300,000 = $400,000 of cost of goods available – ending inventory of $115,000 = cost of goods sold of $285,000.)
Alternatively, if last year's ending inventory was $100,000 and the current year's ending inventory is $93,000, there will be a credit to Inventory for $7,000 and a debit to Inventory Change for $7,000. When the debit of $7,000 in the Inventory Change account is combined with the debit of $300,000 in net purchases, the cost of goods sold is $307,000. (The alternative is: beginning inventory of $100,000 + net purchases of $300,000 = cost of goods available of $400,000 – ending inventory of $93,000 = cost of goods sold of $307,000.)",what
What are goods in transit?,"Definition of Goods in Transit
Goods in transit refers to inventory items and other products that have been shipped by a seller, but have not yet reached the purchaser.
When goods are in transit at the end of an accounting period, they require special accounting attention since the goods are not physically present at either the seller's or the buyer's location. It is necessary to examine whether the sales terms were FOB shipping point or FOB destination. The rules to be followed are:

If the terms are FOB shipping point, the goods in transit are the property of the buyer
If the terms are FOB destination, the goods in transit are the property of the seller

Example of Goods in Transit
Let's assume that both a company (seller) and its customer (buyer) have accounting periods which end on December 31. The company ships a truckload of merchandise on December 30 to a customer who is located 2,000 miles away. The merchandise arrives at the customer's location on January 2. Between December 30 and January 2, the merchandise is an example of goods in transit. 
If the terms are FOB shipping point, the company (seller) will record a sale and receivable as of December 30, and will not include the goods in transit as its December 31 inventory. On December 31, the customer (buyer) is the owner of the goods in transit and will need to report a purchase, a payable, and must include the cost of the goods in transit in its inventory cost.
If the terms of the sale are FOB destination, the company (seller) will not have a sale and receivable until January 2. This means the company (seller) must include the cost of the goods in transit in its inventory as of December 31. [The customer (buyer) will not have a purchase, payable, or inventory of the goods as of December 31. The customer's (buyer's) purchase, payable, and increase in inventory will occur on January 2.]",what
What is EOQ?,"Definition of EOQ
EOQ is the acronym for economic order quantity. The economic order quantity is the optimum quantity of an item to be purchased at one time in order to minimize the combined annual costs of ordering and carrying the item in inventory.
EOQ is also referred to as the optimum lot size.
The formula to calculate the economic order quantity (EOQ) is the square root of [(2 times the annual demand in units times the incremental cost to process an order) divided by (the incremental annual cost to carry one unit in inventory)].
Example of EOQ Calculation
Assume that a company has steady demand of 12,000 units per year for one of its products. The company purchases the product from its supplier at a cost of $100 each. The company's incremental cost to process an order is $144 and its incremental annual cost to carry the product in inventory is $16 per unit.
EOQ = the square root of [(2 X 12,000 units of annual demand X $144 the incremental cost to process an order) / $16 the incremental annual cost to carry one unit in inventory] = the square root of [(2 X 12,000 X $144) / $16] = the square root of [$3,456,000 / $16] = square root of 216,000 units = 465 units (rounded to a whole unit).",what
How do you calculate the cost of goods sold for a retailer?,"Formula for Calculating a Retailer's Cost of Goods Sold
A retailer's cost of goods sold is:

The cost of the retailer's beginning inventory
Plus the cost of its net purchases (purchases minus purchase discounts and purchase returns and allowance) and freight-in
Equals the cost of goods available
Minus the cost of its ending inventory
Equals the cost of goods sold

A second formula for calculating a retailer's cost of goods sold is:

The cost of the retailer's net purchases including any freight-in
Plus the decrease in inventory OR minus the increase in inventory

Example of Calculating a Retailer's Cost of Goods Sold
Assume that a retailer's information includes: net purchases including freight-in is $450,000; beginning inventory had a cost of $50,000; ending inventory had a cost of $60,000.
Using the above information the cost of goods sold is $440,000.
One calculation is: beginning inventory of $50,000 + net purchases of $450,000 = cost of goods available of $500,000 - $60,000 of ending inventory = cost of goods sold of $440,000.
The other calculation is: net purchases of $450,000 minus the increase in inventory of $10,000 = the cost of goods sold of $440,000.
When there is inflation, the retailer must also elect a cost flow assumption in order to determine the cost of the ending inventory, which of course is a factor in the calculation of the cost of goods sold.",what
What is a LIFO Reserve?,"Definition of LIFO Reserve
The LIFO reserve is a contra inventory account that indicates the difference between the following:

Inventory cost reported on the balance sheet under the LIFO cost flow assumption
Inventory cost under the FIFO cost flow assumption

The credit balance in the LIFO reserve reports the difference since the time that LIFO was adopted. The change in the balance during the current year represents the current year's impact on the cost of goods sold.
The disclosure of the LIFO reserve allows readers to better compare the financial statements of a company using LIFO with the financial statements of a company using FIFO. Since the accounting profession has discouraged the use of the word ""reserve"", the inventory notes in the financial statements have descriptions such as Revaluation to LIFO, Excess of FIFO over LIFO cost, and LIFO allowance instead of LIFO reserve.
Example of LIFO Reserve
A U.S. company's accounting system uses FIFO, but the company wants its financial and income tax reporting to use LIFO due to the persistent increases in the cost of its inventory items. LIFO will result in the most recent higher costs being reported in the cost of goods sold resulting in less gross profit, less net income, less taxable income, and less income taxes than FIFO. LIFO also means that the older lower costs remain in inventory.
With consistently increasing costs (and stable or increasing quantities of inventory items) the balance in the LIFO reserve account will be an ever-increasing credit balance that reduces the company's FIFO inventory cost.",what
Are utility bills an expense or a liability?,"Definition of Utility Bills
Utility bills are invoices received by a company for the natural gas, electricity, water, and sewer charges that the company used during a previous month or other period of time. The usage and the amount of each bill is generally based on the meters located on the company's property. In other words, the utilities provide the gas, electricity, etc. in advance of being paid. Therefore, the company is receiving the gas, electricity, etc. before it pays for them and has a liability until the bills are paid. 
Example of Utility Bills
Let's assume that a retailer begins operations on December 1 and it uses natural gas for heating and it uses electricity for lighting and to operate its computers and equipment. Let's assume that the utility reads the meters on the last day of every month and prepares the utility bills based on the meters' readings. The retailer receives its first utility bills on January 8th and must remit the amount by February 2.
Under the accrual basis of accounting, the retailer's income statement for the month of December must report the cost of the gas and electricity that it used during December. On its December 31 balance sheet, the retailer must report the amounts it owes to the utilities as of December 31.
If the utility bills for December's usage are not available at the time that the retailer's financial statements are prepared, the retailer will record an accrual adjusting entry that debits Utilities Expense and credits Accrued Utilities Payable for December's estimated amount.
In our example, the utility bills for gas and electricity used in December are both an expense and a liability as of December 31. When the utility bills are paid, the liability is eliminated.",what
What is a purchase return?,"Definition of Purchase Return
A purchase return occurs when a buyer returns merchandise that it had purchased from a supplier. Since the return of purchased merchandise is time consuming and costly, under the periodic inventory system there will be an account Purchases Returns. This allows the company's management to see the magnitude of the returns that occurred.
The account Purchases Returns is a general ledger account that will have a credit balance (or no balance). Its credit balance will offset the debit balance in the Purchases account. 
Example of a Purchase Return
Let's assume that a company using the periodic inventory system, purchased merchandise having a cost of $1,000 with terms of net 30 days. This was recorded with:

A debit to Purchases for $1,000
A credit to Accounts Payable for $1,000

A few days later, the company discovered that some of the merchandise it received was of a lower quality. The company notified the supplier and was instructed to return the merchandise. Assuming this merchandise had a cost of $200, the company recorded the purchases return as follows:

A debit to Accounts Payable for $200
A credit to Purchases Returns $200

The debit of $1,000 in the Purchases account and the credit of $200 in the Purchases Returns will mean that for this transaction the company had net purchases of $800.",what
Is there a difference between work-in-process and work-in-progress?,"It depends on the user of the terms.
Definition of Work-in-Process
I use the term ""work-in-process"" to mean a manufacturer's inventory that is not yet completed. I think of work-in-process as the goods that are on the factory floor of a manufacturer. The amount of Work-in-Process Inventory would be reported along with Raw Materials Inventory and Finished Goods Inventory on the manufacturer's balance sheet as a current asset.
Definition of Work-in-Progress
I use the term ""work-in-progress"" to mean construction of long term assets (that will be used in the company's business) that are not yet completed. For example, if a company is constructing an addition to its building and the work is only partially completed, the amount spent so far would be recorded as Work-in-Progress, Construction in Progress, or Construction Work-in-Progress (CWIP) and the account would be on the balance sheet as a long-term asset in the section entitled Property, Plant and Equipment. When the project is completed and put into service, the amount would be transferred out of CWIP and would be reported in the account Buildings within Property, Plant and Equipment. At that point, the depreciation of the addition will begin. (If a company is constructing an assembly line or a huge machine that will take time to build, the amounts would also be accumulated in CWIP. When the project is completed and is placed into service, the amount will be transferred from CWIP to Equipment and depreciation will begin.)
To complicate matters, companies that produce items under a long-term contract will use an account entitled Construction-in-Process.
Your question points out the need for caution and an understanding of what the communicator intends. Keep in mind that the sender of a message might not realize that there are important differences between slightly different terms.",what
What is the difference between normal costing and standard costing?,"Definition of Normal Costing
Normal costing for manufactured products consists of following:

Actual cost of materials
Actual cost of direct labor
Applied manufacturing overhead cost based on a predetermined manufacturing overhead rate

The three product costs are used for calculating the cost of goods sold and the cost of the various inventories.
If there is a difference between the total amount of overhead costs applied to the products and the total amount of actual overhead costs incurred, the difference is referred to as a variance. If the amount of the variance is not significant, it will usually be assigned to the cost of goods sold. If the variance is significant, it should be prorated to the cost of goods sold, the work-in-process inventory, and the finished goods inventory based on their amounts of applied overhead.
Definition of Standard Costing
Standard costing for manufactured products consists of the following:

Predetermined materials costs
Predetermined direct labor costs
Predetermined manufacturing overhead costs

These standard costs are used to calculate the manufacturer's cost of goods sold and inventories.
If the actual costs vary only slightly from the standard costs, the resulting variances will be assigned to the cost of goods sold. If the variances are significant, they should be prorated to the cost of goods sold and to various inventories based on their amounts of the standard costs.",what
What is carriage inwards?,"Definition of Carriage Inwards
Carriage inwards refers to the transportation costs required to be paid by the purchaser when it receives merchandise it ordered with terms FOB shipping point. Carriage inwards is also known as freight-in or transportation-in.
Carriage inwards is considered to be part of the cost of the items purchased. Hence, for inventory items carriage inwards will be part of the cost of the goods available, the cost of inventory, and the cost of goods sold.
Example of Carriage Inwards
Assume that a company uses the periodic inventory method and it purchases goods with terms FOB shipping point. As a result the company is responsible for paying the cost of the carriage inwards. The company will record the amount in the general ledger account Carriage Inwards (or Freight-in or Transportation-in). The carriage inwards costs are considered to be part of the cost of items purchased, since an asset's cost is defined as all costs that are necessary to get the asset in place and ready for use.",what
What is the difference between net cash flow and net income?,"Under the accrual method of accounting, net income is calculated as follows: revenues earned minus the expenses incurred in order to earn those revenues. If a company earns revenues in December but allows those customers to pay in 30 days, the cash from the December revenues will likely be received in January. In this situation the December revenues will increase the December net income, but will not increase the company's December net cash flow.
Under accrual accounting, expenses are matched to the accounting period when the related revenues occur or when the costs have expired. For example, a retailer may have purchased and paid for merchandise in October. However, the merchandise remained in inventory until it was sold in December. The company's net cash flow decreases in October when the company pays for the merchandise. However, net income decreases in December when the cost of the goods sold is matched with the December sales.
There are many other examples of expenses occurring in one accounting period but the payments occur in a different accounting period. In short, the statement of cash flows is a needed financial statement because the income statement does not report cash flows.",what
What is a purchase discount?,"Definition of Purchase Discount
A purchase discount is a deduction that a company may receive if the supplier offers it and the company pays the supplier's invoice within a specified period of time. The purchase discount is also known as a cash discount or early-payment discount. (A supplier offering the discount will record the discounts taken by its customers in the account Sales Discounts.)
Purchase Discounts is also a general ledger account used by a company purchasing inventory goods and accounting for them under the periodic inventory system.
Example of Purchase Discount
Assume that a company receives a supplier's invoice of $5,000 with the credit terms 2/10 net 30. The company will be allowed to subtract a purchase discount of $100 (2% of $5,000) and remit $4,900 if the invoice is paid in 10 days. Otherwise, the company must pay the full $5,000 within 30 days.
If a company purchases office equipment for $20,000 and the invoice has credit terms of 1/10, net 30, the company can deduct $200 (1% of $20,000) and remit $19,800 if the invoice is paid within 10 days. If that occurs, the company will record the equipment at its cost of $19,800.",what
Are commissions a cost of goods sold account or an expense?,"Definition of Commissions
Commissions are compensation for obtaining sales. Hence, sales commissions are a selling expense and will be recorded in general ledger accounts having Sales Commissions Expenses in their title. Sales commissions are considered to be operating expenses and are presented on the income statement as SG&A expenses. (SG&A is the acronym for selling, general and administrative expenses.)
Sales commissions are not part of the cost of a product. Therefore, sales commissions are not assigned to the cost of goods held in inventory or to the cost of goods sold.",what
Are the goods purchased by a retailer an expense or an asset?,"Definition of Goods Purchased by a Retailer
The goods purchased by a retailer are the products or merchandise that it buys and plans to resell.
The goods that are sold during the accounting period must be reported on the retailer's income statement as the cost of goods sold. 
The goods that are unsold at the end of the accounting period must be reported on the retailer's balance sheet as inventory.
Accounting for the Goods Purchased
There are two ways to record the goods at the time the goods are purchased:

Their cost could be recorded in an expense account (such as Cost of Goods Sold)
Their cost could be recorded in an asset account (such as Inventory)

Either way, the Inventory account must be adjusted to the actual amount. The other part of the adjusting entry is recorded in the income statement account.
Examples of Accounting for Goods Purchased
Assume that a retailer begins the year with inventory having a cost of $800. It ends the year with inventory having a cost of $900. During the year the retailer purchased goods at a cost of $7,000. Let's also assume that the cost per unit did not change during the year.
If the retailer records the $7,000 of purchases as an expense (cost of goods sold), then at the end of the year the retailer's adjusting entry must debit Inventory for $100 (since the inventory has increased from $800 to $900). The other account in this adjusting entry is the expense Cost of Goods Sold which is credited for $100. As a result, the income statement will report the cost of goods sold at $6,900 ($7,000 minus the $100 credit). The balance sheet will report inventory of $900 ($800 plus the debit of $100).
If the retailer records the $7,000 of purchases as an asset, the Inventory account balance increases from $800 to $7,800. Since the actual inventory at the end of the year is $900, the adjusting entry must credit Inventory for $6,900 ($7,800 minus $900) and debit Cost of Goods Sold for $6,900.
Regardless of whether the goods purchased were initially recorded as an expense or as an asset, the amounts must be adjusted so that the financial statements report the expense (reported as the cost of goods sold on the income statement for the year) at $6,900 and the asset inventory (reported on the balance sheet as of the end of the year) at $900.",what
What is the difference between FIFO and LIFO?,"Difference Between FIFO and LIFO
The difference between FIFO and LIFO will exist only if the unit costs of a company's products are increasing or decreasing.
U.S. companies may elect either the FIFO or the FIFO cost flow assumptions. However, after making a change, a company cannot switch back. For U.S. income tax reporting, a company must use the same cost flow assumption as it uses on its financial statements.
Example of Difference Between FIFO and LIFO
Let's assume that a retail store carried only one product during its first year of business. It purchased 30 units in January at a cost of $40 each, 30 units in June at $43 each, and 30 units in November at $46 each. Thus, for the year the retailer purchased 90 units with a total actual cost of $3,870 [[email protected]$40 + [email protected]$43 + [email protected]$46]. Let's also assume that 70 units were sold and that 20 units remain in inventory at the end of the year.
Using FIFO the company assumes that first costs (the oldest costs) for 70 units will be removed from inventory and will become the cost of goods sold. Therefore, the FIFO cost of the 70 units sold had a cost of $2,950 [[email protected]$40 + [email protected]$43 + [email protected]$46]. FIFO also means the 20 units remaining in inventory had the most recent cost of $46 each for a total of $920.
Using LIFO and the periodic inventory system, the company assumes that the last costs (the most recent actual costs) for 70 units will be removed from inventory first and will become the cost of goods sold regardless of which units were physically shipped to customers. Therefore, the LIFO cost of the 70 units sold is $3,070 [[email protected]$46 + [email protected]$43 + [email protected]$40]. LIFO also means that the 20 units remaining in inventory had the oldest cost of $40 each for a total of $800.
In our example, LIFO results in $120 less of ending inventory ($800 vs. $920), $120 more of cost of goods sold, and therefore $120 less of gross profit. The lower gross profit and the associated lower taxable income for a U.S. company can result in less taxable income, which may result in less income tax payments for a profitable corporation.",what
What is the inventory turnover ratio?,"Definition of Inventory Turnover Ratio
The inventory turnover ratio is an important financial ratio that indicates a company's past ability to sell its goods. Converting inventory into cash is critical for a company to pay its obligations when they are due.
How to Calculate the Inventory Turnover Ratio
The calculation for the inventory turnover ratio is: cost of goods sold for a year divided by average inventory during the same 12 months. 
A higher inventory turnover ratio is viewed as better than a lower ratio.
Note: The cost of goods sold is used (not sales) in calculating the inventory turnover ratio because the company's inventory is recorded and reported at its cost (not at its selling prices). However, be cautioned that some people will use sales and therefore will be overstating the inventory turnover ratio. It is also important to use the average amount of inventory throughout the entire year since using only the end-of-the-year amounts may result in a much lower average.
Example of Inventory Turnover Ratio
To illustrate the inventory turnover ratio, let’s assume that during the most recent year a company’s cost of goods sold was $3,600,000 and the average cost of its inventory account during the year was $400,000. As a result, the company’s inventory turnover ratio is: cost of goods sold of $3,600,000 divided by average inventory of $400,000 = 9 times during the recent year. This could be compared to the company's ratio in previous years and to other companies in the same industry.
Even with a favorable inventory turnover ratio, a company may have some excess and obsolete inventory items. Therefore, it is wise to compare the quantity of each item in inventory to the quantity of each item sold during the past year.",what
What is a customer deposit?,"Definition of Customer Deposit
A customer deposit could be money that a company receives from a customer prior to the company earning it (by providing the customer with goods or services). In other words, the company receives the asset Cash and has an obligation to provide the goods or services to the customer or to return the money. Hence, the current liability account Customer Deposits is credited. When the company earns the deposit amount, the current liability will be debited and Sales Revenues will be credited.
A customer deposit could also refer to the money a bank receives from a depositor. Since the bank is not earning this money, the amount is recorded by the bank with a debit to Cash and a credit to Customer Deposits.
Example of Customer Deposit
Let's assume that Ace Manufacturing Inc. agrees to produce an expensive, custom-made machine for one of its customers. Ace requires that the customer pay $50,000 before Ace begins to design and construct the machine. The $50,000 payment is made in December 2018 and the machine must be finished by March 31, 2019. The $50,000 is a down payment toward the machine's price of $400,000.
In December 2018 Ace will debit Cash for $50,000 and will credit Customer Deposits, a current liability account. When the machine is completed in 2019, Ace will debit Customer Deposits for $50,000 and will credit Sales Revenues for $50,000.",what
What is the difference between inventory and the cost of goods sold?,"Definition of Inventory
Inventory for a retailer or distributor is the merchandise that was purchased and has not yet been sold to customers. A manufacturer's inventory consists of raw materials, packaging materials, work-in-process, and the finished goods that are owned and on hand.
Inventory is generally valued at its cost and it is likely to be the largest component of the company's current assets. Since the unit cost of inventory items will change over time, a company must select a cost flow assumption (FIFO, LIFO, average) for removing the costs from inventory and sending them to the cost of goods sold.
Definition of Cost of Goods Sold
The cost of goods sold is the cost of the products that have been sold to customers during the period of the income statement. How the costs flow out of inventory will have an impact on the company's cost of goods sold. The cost of goods sold will likely be the largest expense reported on the income statement.
Example of Inventory Cost and Cost of Goods Sold
To show the connection between inventory and the cost of goods sold, let's assume that a retailer sells only one product. Let's also assume that the retailer begins the year with 100 units of the product and purchases an additional 1,500 units throughout the year. The combination of the beginning inventory plus the purchases is known as the goods available for sale, which in this example is 1,600 units. If there are 125 units on hand at the end of the year, the ending inventory will report the cost of 125 units. The cost of goods sold for the year will be the cost of the 1,475 units that are no longer available.",what
What is the gross profit method of inventory?,"Definition of Gross Profit Method
The gross profit method is a technique for estimating the amount of ending inventory. The gross profit method might be used to estimate each month's ending inventory or it might be used as part of a calculation to determine the approximate amount of inventory that has been lost due to theft, fire, or other reasons.
The gross profit method of estimating ending inventory assumes that the gross profit percentage or the gross margin ratio is known. For example, if a company purchases goods for $80 and sells them for $100, its gross profit is $20. This results in a gross profit percentage or gross margin ratio of 20% of the selling price. Therefore, when the company has sales of $50,000 it is assumed that its cost of those goods will be $40,000 (80% of $50,000 in sales; or sales of $50,000 minus $10,000 of gross profit). 
Example of Gross Profit Method
Assume you need to estimate the cost of a company's July 31 inventory. The last time the inventory was calculated was seven months earlier on December 31 when it had a cost of $15,000. Since December 31, the company purchased goods having a cost of $42,000; its sales were $50,000; and the gross profit percentage has remained at 20% (hence its cost of goods sold would be 80% of sales). The inventory at the end of the day on July 31 is estimated as follows:

Inventory cost at December 31 was $15,000
Purchases between December 31 and July 31 had a cost of $42,000
Cost of goods available: $57,000 ($15,000 + $42,000)
Cost of goods sold: sales of $50,000 X 80% = $40,000
Ending Inventory at July 31 at its estimated cost: $17,000 ($57,000 cost of goods available minus $40,000 of cost of goods sold)",what
Is the installation labor for a new asset expensed or included in the cost of the asset?,"Accounting for Labor to Install Asset
The definition of an asset's cost is all costs that are necessary to get an asset in place and ready for use. Therefore, the cost of the installation labor (wages and related fringe benefits) is part of the cost of the asset (and not an immediate expense of the accounting period).
The total cost of the asset, including installation costs, will become an expense when the asset depreciated over the asset's useful life.",what
What are inventoriable costs?,"Inventoriable costs are 1) the costs to purchase or manufacture products which will be resold, plus 2) the costs to get those products in place and ready for sale. Inventoriable costs are also known as product costs.
To illustrate, let's assume that a retailer purchases an item for resale by paying $20 to the supplier. The item is purchased FOB shipping point, which means that the retailer must pay the freight from the supplier to its location. If that freight cost is $1, then the retailer's inventoriable cost is $21. Assuming this is the only item in the retailer's inventory, the retailer's balance sheet will report inventory at a cost of $21. When the item is sold, the retailer's inventory will decrease by $21 and the $21 will be reported on the income statement as the cost of goods sold.
In the case of a manufacturer, a product's inventoriable costs are the costs of the direct materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead incurred in manufacturing the product.",what
What is managerial accounting?,"Definition of Managerial Accounting
Managerial accounting is also known as management accounting and it includes many of the topics that are included in cost accounting.
Some of the managerial topics involve the computation of a manufacturer's product costs that are needed for the external financial statements which must comply with US GAAP. Other topics involve analyses and reports that are not distributed outside of the company but are used by management in its decision making and in the planning and control of the business operations.
Examples of Managerial Accounting Topics
Managerial accounting topics often include:

Job order costing
Process costing
Absorption costing vs. variable costing
Understanding cost behavior and cost-volume-profit analysis
Operational budgeting
Standard costing and variance analysis
Activity based costing
Pricing of individual products and services
Analyzing the profitability of product lines, customers, territories, etc.
Capital budgeting
Ratio analysis",what
What is a standard cost?,"Definition of Standard Cost
A standard cost is described as a predetermined cost, an estimated future cost, an expected cost, a budgeted unit cost, a forecast cost, or as the ""should be"" cost. Standard costs are often an integral part of a manufacturer's annual profit plan and operating budgets.
When standard costs are used in a manufacturing setting, a product's standard cost for a future accounting period will consist of the following:

Direct materials: a standard quantity of each material and a standard cost per unit of material
Direct labor: a standard quantity of labor and a standard cost per hour of labor
Manufacturing overhead: a budget for the fixed overhead, the standard variable overhead rate, and the standard quantity for applying a fixed and variable overhead rates

In a standard costing system, the standard costs of the manufacturing activities will be recorded in the inventories and the cost of goods sold accounts. Since the company must pay its vendors and production workers the actual costs incurred, there are likely to be some differences. The differences between the standard costs and the actual manufacturing costs are referred to as  cost variances  and will be recorded in separate variance accounts. Any balance in a variance account indicates that the company is deviating from the amounts in its profit plan.
While standard costs can be a useful management tool for a manufacturer, the manufacturer's external financial statements must comply with the cost principle and the matching principle. Therefore, significant variances must be reviewed and properly assigned or allocated to the cost of goods sold and/or inventories.
AccountingCoach PRO includes forms to assist in a better understanding of standard costs and their related variances.",what
Why would a company use LIFO instead of FIFO?,"Definitions of FIFO and LIFO
FIFO and LIFO are two of the cost flow assumptions used by U.S. companies with inventory items.
FIFO moves the first/oldest costs from inventory and reports them as the cost of goods sold and leaves the last/more recent costs in inventory.
LIFO moves the latest/more recent costs from inventory and reports them as the cost of goods sold and leaves the first/oldest costs in inventory.
A U.S. company may switch from FIFO to LIFO. However, after the switch the company must use LIFO consistently. 
Reason for Using FIFO Instead of LIFO
If a U.S. corporation's cost of inventory items are continuously increasing and the corporation has been experiencing operating losses and negative taxable income, the use of FIFO means matching its oldest/lower costs with its current sales. The result is a larger gross profit and a positive operating income.
Reason for Using LIFO
If a U.S. corporation's costs of inventory items are continuously increasing, a profitable U.S. corporation will have lower income tax payments with LIFO. This results from matching the most recent higher costs of its items to the most recent sales. (The higher cost of goods sold means lower net income and lower taxable income than FIFO.)
Another reason for a company to use the LIFO cost flow assumption is to improve the matching of costs with sales. If the company had matched the old low costs using FIFO, the company would show a greater profit that was partly caused by merely holding some old inventory items.",what
What are the effects of overstating inventory?,"If a corporation overstates its inventory, it will also be overstating its gross profit and net income as well as its current assets, total assets, retained earnings, stockholders' equity, and all of the related financial ratios.
The gross profit and net income are overstated as a result of overstating inventory because not enough of the cost of goods available is being charged to the cost of goods sold. The higher amount of net income means that the reported amount of retained earnings and stockholders' equity is also too high.
Since the overstated amount of inventory at the end of one accounting period becomes the beginning inventory of the following period, the following period's cost of goods sold will be too high and will result in the period's gross profit and net income being too low. (The retained earnings and other balance sheet amounts will be correct at the end of the second period.)",what
What are cost flow assumptions?,"Definition of Cost Flow Assumptions
The term cost flow assumptions refers to the manner in which costs are removed from a company's inventory and are reported as the cost of goods sold. In the U.S. the cost flow assumptions include FIFO, LIFO, and average. (If specific identification is used, there is no need to make an assumption.)
FIFO, LIFO, average are assumptions because the flow of costs out of inventory does not have to match the way the items were physically removed from inventory.
Example of Cost Flow Assumptions
To illustrate, let's assume that a company has four units of the same product in its inventory. The units were purchased at increasing costs and in the following sequence: $40, $41, $43, and $44. If the company physically removes and sells the oldest unit (the unit that had a cost of $40), the cost removed from inventory and reported as the cost of goods sold (COGS) will vary depending on the cost flow assumption:

Under the FIFO cost flow assumption, the oldest cost of $40 is removed from inventory and charged to COGS
Under the LIFO cost flow assumption, the most recent cost of $44 is removed from inventory and charged to COGS
Under the average cost flow assumption, the average cost of $42 is removed from inventory and charged to COGS

Other than a one-time change to a better cost flow assumption, the company must consistently use the same cost flow assumption.",what
Is there a difference between the accounts Purchases and Inventory?,"Purchases Account Under the Periodic Inventory System
The general ledger account Purchases is used to record the purchases of inventory items under the periodic inventory system. Under the periodic system the account Inventory will have no entries until it is adjusted at the end of the accounting year so that it reports the cost of the ending inventory.
Under the periodic system, the cost in the account Purchases will be added to the cost of the beginning inventory to arrive at the cost of goods available. The cost of the ending inventory is computed through a physical count (or an estimate) and is subtracted from the cost of goods available to arrive at the cost of goods sold.
Inventory Account Under the Perpetual Inventory System
The account Purchases is nonexistent with the perpetual inventory system. Under the perpetual inventory system, the cost of inventory items purchased are recorded directly into the account Inventory.
Under the perpetual system, the costs of the goods sold are removed from the account Inventory when the goods are sold and are recorded in the account Cost of Goods Sold. As a result, the balance in the account Inventory should be the cost of the ending inventory.",what
"If inventory is understated at the end of the year, what is the effect on net income?","If inventory is understated at the end of the year, the net income for the year is also understated.
Here's a brief explanation. If a company has a cost of goods available of $100,000 and it assigns too little of that cost to inventory, then too much of that cost will appear on the income statement as the cost of goods sold. Too much cost on the income statement will mean too little net income.
Another way to view this is through the accounting equation, Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity. If you assign too little of the cost of goods available to Assets, then the amount of Owner's Equity will be too little—caused by net income being too little.",what
What is FIFO?,"Definition of FIFO
In accounting, FIFO is the acronym for First-In, First-Out. It is a cost flow assumption usually associated with the valuation of inventory and the cost of goods sold. Under FIFO, the oldest costs will be the first costs to be removed from the balance sheet account Inventory and will be the first costs to be included in the cost of goods sold on the income statement. Therefore, under the FIFO cost flow assumption the most recent costs will remain in Inventory to be reported on the company's balance sheet.
Example of FIFO 
Let's assume that a company sold only one product and had 10 units on hand at the beginning of the accounting year with a cost of $19 each. During the year the company purchased an additional 145 units in this order: 40 units at $20, 50 units at $21, and 55 units at $22. Let's also assume that the company uses the periodic inventory system, the FIFO cost flow assumption and that 130 units were sold. Therefore, there will be 25 units remaining in inventory. With the FIFO cost flow assumption, the first costs to come out of inventory and become the cost of goods sold are: [email protected]$19 + [email protected]$20 + [email protected]$21 + [email protected]$22. The costs that remain in inventory will be [email protected]$22.",what
What is inventory valuation?,"In the U.S. inventory valuation is the dollar amount associated with the items contained in a company's inventory. Initially the amount is the cost of the items defined as all of the costs necessary to get the inventory items in place and ready for sale. (The costs of selling and administration are not included in the cost of inventory.)
Since the inventory items are constantly being sold and restocked and since the costs of the items are constantly changing, a company must select a cost flow assumption. Cost flow assumptions include first-in, first-out; weighted average; and last-in, first out. The company is expected to be consistent in its application of the selected cost flow assumption.
A manufacturer's inventory valuation will include the costs of production, namely direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead. Manufacturers are also required to consistently follow their cost flow assumptions.
Inventory valuation is important in that it affects the cost of goods sold, a significant amount reported on the company's income statement. Inventory is also an important component of a company's current assets, working capital, and current ratio.
If the net realizable value of a company's inventory declines to a value which is less than its cost, the company is usually required to report the inventory at its net realizable value. (Net realizable value is the expected selling price minus the the costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.)",what
What are production costs?,"Definition of Production Costs
In managerial accounting and cost accounting, production costs are the costs that occur in the manufacturing facilities.
Production costs are also referred to as manufacturing costs, product costs, and a manufacturer's inventoriable costs.
Examples of Production Costs
A manufacturer's production costs consists of the costs for the following:

Direct materials
Direct labor
Manufacturing overhead",what
What are the reasons for high inventory days?,"Definition of Inventory Days
I assume that inventory days is referring to the days' sales in inventory. If so, then inventory days is also related to the inventory turnover ratio. For instance, when the inventory turnover is low, the days' sales in inventory will be high. When the inventory turnover is high, the days' sales in inventory will be low.
Examples or Reasons for High Inventory Days
Assume that a company maintains a constant quantity of items in inventory. If economic or competitive factors cause a sudden and significant drop in sales, the inventory days or days' sales in inventory will increase.
Next, let's assume that a retailer increases its inventory quantities for some new products and for some special promotions of existing products. If the sales do not increase, the inventory days or days' sales in inventory will increase.",what
What is stock?,"In accounting there are two common uses of the term stock. One meaning of stock refers to the goods on hand which is to be sold to customers. In that situation, stock means inventory.
The term stock is also used to mean the ownership shares of a corporation. For example, an owner of a corporation will have a stock certificate which provides evidence of his or her ownership of a corporation's common stock or preferred stock. The owner of the corporation's common or preferred stock is known as a stockholder.",what
What is LIFO?,"Definition of LIFO
LIFO is the acronym for last-in, first-out, which is a cost flow assumption often used by U.S. corporations in moving costs from inventory to the cost of goods sold.
Under LIFO, the most recent costs of products purchased (or manufactured) are the first costs to be removed from inventory and matched with the sales revenues reported on the income statement. This means that the oldest costs remain in inventory.
LIFO became popular due to inflation and the fact the U.S. income tax rules permit corporations (and other businesses) to use LIFO. With LIFO a corporation is able to match its recent, more-inflated costs with its sales thereby reporting less taxable income than would occur using another cost flow assumption. LIFO is justified because matching the latest costs with the latest sales revenues is a better indicator of the corporation's current profitability (as opposed to matching older lower costs with recent sales revenues).
It is important to understand that LIFO is a cost flow assumption and the flow of costs can be different from the flow of the physical units. In other words, under LIFO a corporation can ship its oldest physical units of product first, but can remove from inventory the cost of the most recently purchased items.
Example of LIFO
Assume that a corporation uses LIFO and has three units of a product in its inventory. Due to its supplier raising its prices, the corporation purchased the items at different costs and in the following sequence: $40, $44, and $46. The corporation ships the oldest item (the one purchased for $40) to a customer at a selling price of $60. However, under the LIFO cost flow assumption the company reports its cost of goods sold at $46 (the latest cost) and reports a gross profit of $14. (The costs of $40 and $44 remain in inventory.) 
Had the corporation used FIFO, it would have removed $40 from inventory and matched it with the selling price of $60. The result would have been a gross profit of $20 (instead of $14 using LIFO). As a result, LIFO allowed the corporation to avoid paying income tax on the additional $6.",what
What is the gross profit method?,"The gross profit method is a technique used to estimate the amount of ending inventory. The technique could be used for monthly financial statements when a physical inventory is not feasible. (However, it is no substitute for an annual physical inventory.) It is also used to estimate the amount of missing inventory caused by theft, fire or other disaster.
Here's how the gross profit method works. First you must determine the gross profit percentage (gross profit margin) that your company is currently experiencing. For example, if a retailer buys its merchandise for $0.70 and sells the merchandise for $1.00, it has a gross profit of $0.30. The gross profit of $0.30 divided by the selling price of $1.00 means a gross profit margin of 30% of sales. This also means that the retailer's cost of goods sold is 70% of sales.
Next, compute the sales value of the merchandise sold since the last time an inventory amount was known. Let's assume that the sales amounted to $100,000. Given the sales value of $100,000 the cost of the goods sold should be approximately $70,000 (70% from above times $100,000).
Add the cost of the goods purchased since the last inventory to that inventory amount. Let's assume that previous inventory amount was $15,000 and that there were purchases of $75,000. That means the cost of goods that were available for sale totals $90,000 ($15,000 + $75,000). Since the estimated cost of goods sold was $70,000 (from above), the estimated cost of goods in inventory should be approximately $20,000 ($90,000 minus $70,000).
Be certain that the gross profit percentage is indicative of reality and remember that the resulting amount is an estimate.",what
What is work-in-process inventory (WIP)?,"You can think of work-in-process (WIP) inventory as the goods that are on the factory floor. The manufacturing of these goods has begun but has not yet been completed.
You can also think of work-in-process inventory as the general ledger current asset account that reports the cost of the goods that are on the factory floor. In the U.S. the cost reported as WIP should be the cost of the direct materials, direct labor and the allocation of manufacturing overhead for the goods on the factory floor.
As the WIP goods become completely manufactured, their cost will be credited to the WIP account and will be debited to the Finished Goods Inventory account.
You can expect to see the cost of a manufacturer's work-in-process inventory in the notes to its financial statements.",what
What is inventory shrinkage?,"Inventory shrinkage is the term used to describe the loss of inventory. For example, if the inventory records of a retailer report that 3,261 units of Product X are on hand, but a physical count indicates that there are only 3,248 units on hand, there is an inventory shrinkage of 13 units. The retailer's inventory shrinkage might be due to shoplifting, employee theft, damage, obsolescence, etc.
The term shrinkage is also used by manufacturers when referring to the loss of raw materials during a production process. For example, a manufacturer of baked food items will experience shrinkage throughout its processes due to ingredients adhering to the beaters and bowls, and also due to evaporation. This shrinkage is also known as spoilage or waste and it can be either normal or abnormal.",what
What is the entry when a contract is signed?,"Accounting Entry When Signing a Contract
Merely signing a contract does not by itself require a journal entry. In other words, signing a contract for a future transaction does not mean the company is increasing or decreasing an asset or a liability at the time of the signing. Of course, if cash or some other asset is exchanged at the time of the signing, it will have to be recorded.
While a journal entry is not required at the time the contract is signed, significant commitments that are contained in the contract must be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements of the parties to a noncancelable contract.
Examples of No Entry When Signing a Contract
Assume that an electric utility signs a noncancelable contract with a coal company to purchase 100 million tons of coal to be delivered over a one-year period that will begin in three months. On the day the contract is signed, the electric utility does not own any of the coal specified in the contract, nor does it owe for any of the coal, since the coal will not be delivered for at least three months. When the first trainload of coal arrives at the electric utility at least three months later, the utility will record the purchase of only the coal that has arrived and the related account payable.
Likewise, on the day the contract is signed, the coal company does not have a sale of the coal specified in the contract, and it does not have a receivable from the electric utility. Three months later, when the first shipment of coal is delivered to the utility, the coal company will record a sale of the coal and a related account receivable.
If the commitments made by the utility and the coal company are significant, those commitments must be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements of both the utility and the coal company.",what
What is the entry when merchandise has been received but not the vendor's invoice?,"If you received merchandise, but have not received the vendor's invoice by the end of the accounting period, you need to 1) debit Purchases (periodic method) or debit Inventory (perpetual method) for the cost of the goods or merchandise received, and 2) credit Accounts Payable. You also need to include the merchandise in your physical inventory.
When the vendor's invoice is received and processed, be sure to reverse (remove) the above entry.",what
What are the ways to value inventory?,"Generally, the balance sheet of a U.S. company must value inventory at cost. In other words, a company's inventory is not reported at the sales value. (An exception occurs when a company's inventory consists of readily salable commodities that have quoted market prices.)
Since the costs of products may change during an accounting year, a company must select a cost flow assumption that it will use consistently. For instance, should the oldest cost be removed from inventory when an item is sold? If so, the company will select the cost flow assumption known as first-in, first out (FIFO). In the U.S. an alternative is to remove the period's most recent cost when an item is sold. This is known as last-in, first-out (LIFO). Another option is to use an average method such as the weighted-average method or the moving-average method. Both the LIFO method and the average methods will result in different values depending on whether a company uses the perpetual method or the periodic method. Still another option is to use the specific identification method.
The LIFO cost flow assumption can be achieved by tracking the units in inventory or by using price indexes. When price indexes are used, it is referred to as dollar-value LIFO. (Retailers often use a technique called dollar-value retail LIFO.)
The accountants' concept of conservatism can result in some inventories being valued at less than cost. Hence, an additional method for valuing inventory is the lower of cost or net realizable value. For example, if the net realizable value of a company's inventory has declined to an amount that is less than cost, the company will likely have to reduce its inventory cost. The amount of that adjustment will also reduce the current period's net income.
A company's inventory must be measured and reviewed very carefully as it is an important amount for determining a company's financial position and profitability.",what
What are direct materials?,"Direct materials are the traceable matter used in manufacturing a product. The direct materials for a manufacturer of dessert products will include flour, sugar, eggs, milk, vegetable oil, spices, and other ingredients in the recipes. In manufacturing, the direct materials are listed in each product's bill of materials. (Indirect materials such as oil for greasing the baking pans, etc. will likely be viewed as part of the manufacturing supplies and will be allocated to products along with other manufacturing overhead.)
The direct materials contained in manufactured products are also defined as:

a product cost (along with the costs of the direct labor and manufacturing overhead)
an inventoriable cost (along with the costs of direct labor and manufacturing overhead)
a prime cost (along with the cost of direct labor)

The costs of direct materials should be reported in the financial statements according to their location or position:

if not yet put into production, report as raw materials inventory on the balance sheet
if put into production but the goods are not completed, report as part of the cost of work-in-process inventory on the balance sheet
if put into production and the goods are completed but not yet sold, report as part of the cost of the finished goods inventory on the balance sheet
if put into production and the goods have been completed and sold, report as part of the cost of goods sold on the income statement",what
What is an invoice?,"An invoice is defined in a Webster's dictionary as ""an itemized bill for goods sold or services provided, containing individual prices, the total charge, and the terms.""
The invoice is often referred to as the sales invoice. However, the purchaser of the goods or services might refer to the invoice received from the vendor or supplier as a purchase invoice.",what
How does inflation affect the cost of goods sold?,"Inflation and the Cost of Goods Sold
Generally speaking, a company selling goods during periods of inflation will see an increase in its cost of goods sold. When and by how much will depend on the cost flow assumption that is used.
In the U.S., there are several cost flow assumptions available. However, a company must select one and then use it consistently. Below is an overview of three cost flow assumptions and how they affect the cost of goods sold. (However, the cost flow assumption will also affect the company's inventory valuation, as well as its gross profit, net income, income tax payments, and more.)

FIFO. This results in the oldest, lower costs as the first to flow out of inventory and becoming the cost of goods sold
LIFO. This results in the most recent, higher costs as the first to flow out of inventory and becoming the cost of goods sold
Average. This is a compromise between FIFO and LIFO.

More on FIFO
Since FIFO (first-in, first out) is moving the older/lower costs to the cost of goods sold, the recent/higher costs are in inventory. The lower cost of goods sold generally results in larger amounts of gross profit, net income, taxable income, income tax payments, and certain financial ratios. Economists may state that the larger profits using FIFO are illusory since the goods (that were sold) will have to be replaced at higher, current costs. To avoid paying income taxes on these illusory or phantom profits, many U.S. companies have switched from FIFO to LIFO.
More on LIFO
Since LIFO (last-in, first out) is moving the recent/higher costs to the cost of goods sold, the older/lower costs remain in inventory. The higher cost of goods sold generally results in smaller amounts of gross profit, net income taxable income, income tax payments, and certain financial ratios. Economists feel more comfortable with LIFO since the cost of goods sold is closer to the replacement costs of the goods.
The smaller amount of gross profit being reported on the income statement from using LIFO eliminates much of the illusory profit and brings attention to the need to increase selling prices or take other action to maintain its same level of profits. Avoiding paying income taxes on the illusory profits gives the company some of the money that will be required to replace the goods at the new inflated costs.
Keep in mind that these are general comments. You should always determine the specific facts for your situation and should consult with a professional accountant and tax adviser.",what
What is a purchase allowance?,"A purchase allowance is a reduction in the buyer's cost of merchandise that it had purchased. The purchase allowance is granted by the supplier because of a problem such as shipping the wrong items, the incorrect quantity, flaws in the goods, etc. In the case of a purchase allowance, the buyer does not return the merchandise to the supplier.
Under a periodic inventory system, the buyer will record the purchase allowance with 1) a credit to the account Purchase Allowances or to the account Purchase Returns and Allowances, and 2) a debit to Accounts Payable. (The supplier will record the allowance with a debit to Sales Allowances and a credit to Accounts Receivable.)
The buyer will offset the debit balance in its Purchases account with the credit balance in Purchase Allowances as part of its computation of net purchases.",what
Why do purchases appear as expenses on an income statement?,"Generally, the purchases of merchandise are sold in the year they are acquired. Hence, it is logical to match the current period's purchases as expenses on the same income statement that reports the current period's sales revenues.
If some of the purchases are not sold in the same period, there will be a change in inventory. An increase in the amount of inventory will appear on the income statement as a deduction to the current period's purchases. It is a deduction because some of the costs of the current period's purchases are not associated with the sales shown on the income statement. The deduction is reporting that some of the costs of purchases are being deferred to a later period when they will be sold. The deduction is necessary in order to achieve the matching principle: matching the proper amount of the costs of the goods sold with the sales revenues of the accounting period.
A decrease in the amount of inventory will appear on the income statement as an addition to the cost of the purchases. This recognizes that some of the sales included some costs of purchases that were made in an earlier accounting period.",what
What is safety stock?,"Definition of Safety Stock
Safety stock is an additional quantity of an item held by a company in inventory in order to reduce the risk that the item will be out of stock. Safety stock acts as a buffer in case the sales of an item are greater than planned and/or the company's supplier is unable to deliver additional units at the expected time. If the company is a manufacturer, a safety stock of materials could minimize the risk of production being disrupted. 
Of course there are additional holding or carry costs associated with safety stock. However, the holding costs could be less than the cost of not filing a customer's order on time or having to stop its production line.
Example of Safety Stock
Assume that a company uses the economic order quantity (EOQ) model to determine the amount of product or materials it orders. Since the model requires an assumption (estimate) of annual demand, there is a risk that demand will be greater than the estimate used. Let's say that the company's EOQ is 1,000 units. As a precaution, the company may decide to always have an additional 100 units on hand as its safety stock. If demand is not constant, the company could increase the quantity of its safety stock during its peak sales periods and then reduce the quantity during periods of low sales.",what
How do I compute the product cost per unit?,"In accounting, we define the product cost as the direct material, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead. Costs such as advertising, preparing invoices, delivery expense, office salaries, office rent and utilities, and interest on loans are examples of expenses that are not considered to be product costs. Rather, these costs are expensed immediately to the period instead of being assigned to a product.
To be profitable, a company must have its selling prices large enough to cover both the product costs of the units sold and the period expenses.
The product cost is used for valuing the inventory and for determining the cost of goods sold. Since some of the manufacturing overhead costs are fixed in total (factory rent, factory depreciation, factory managers' salaries), the per unit cost of a product will depend upon the number of units manufactured during a given year. In other words, the cost of a product is not know with precision, even though accountants will compute the per unit cost to the nearest penny.",what
How do I record money received for an insurance claim on inventory loss?,"The money received from an insurance company for a claim involving a loss on inventory stock is debited to Cash. Any other proceeds from disposing of the inventory items will also be debited to Cash.
In addition, the Inventory account is credited for the carrying cost of the inventory items, which is usually the original cost of the items. If the total of the debits to Cash is greater than the credits to Inventory, the difference is credited to a gain account, such as Gain from Inventory Damage. If the total of the debits to Cash is less than the credits to Inventory, the difference is a debit to a loss account, such as Loss from Inventory Damage.",what
Why does LIFO usually produce a lower gross profit than FIFO?,"LIFO usually produces a lower gross profit than FIFO  only because the costs of the goods purchased or produced have been increasing over the past decades. Since LIFO assigns the latest costs of the goods purchased or produced to the cost of goods sold, the rising costs mean a higher amount of cost of goods sold on the income statement. That in turn means a lower gross profit than assigning the first or oldest costs to the cost of goods sold under FIFO.
If costs were to steadily decrease over several years, LIFO would result in a higher gross profit than FIFO. The reason is that LIFO would be assigning the latest costs (which will be lower costs than the first or oldest costs) to the cost of goods sold on the income statement. That in turn means a higher gross profit than under the FIFO cost flow assumption.",what
Should inventories be reported at their cost or at their selling prices?,"Generally inventories are reported at their cost. A merchant's inventory would be reported at the merchant's cost to purchase the items. A manufacturer's inventory would be at its cost to produce the items (the cost of direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead).
However, if the net realizable value (NRV) of the inventory is less than the cost, the NRV will usually need to be reported on the balance sheet instead of the cost. Net realizable value is defined as the expected selling price in the ordinary course of business minus any costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. When the cost of the inventory is written down to its NRV, the amount of the write down is reported on the income statement. (In a few industries, such as gold mining and meatpacking, it is accepted practice to report the inventory at its net realizable value.)
Since the unit cost of items in inventory is likely to be changing (think inflation), the costs used for inventory reporting will be based on a cost flow assumption. For example, the FIFO cost flow assumption will result in the inventory being reported at the more recent costs, since the first costs are assumed to have been the first costs out of inventory. Under the LIFO cost flow assumption, the inventory will be valued at the older costs, since the more recent costs are assumed to be the first costs to flow out of inventory.",what
Why is the distinction between product costs and period costs important?,"The distinction between product costs and period costs is important to:

Properly measure a company's net income during the time specified on its income statement, and
To report the proper cost of inventory on the balance sheet

Definition of Product Costs
Product costs include the costs to manufacture products or to purchase products. If a product is unsold, the product costs will be reported as inventory on the balance sheet. When the product is sold, its cost is removed from inventory and will be included on the income statement as the cost of goods sold. Product costs are also referred to as inventoriable costs.
Examples of Product Costs
The product costs for a retailer will be the amount paid to the supplier plus any freight-in. Product costs for a manufacturer will be the direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead used to manufacture a product.
Definition of Period Costs
Period costs are expenses that will be reported on the income statement without ever attaching to products. Since they are not product costs, period costs will not be included in the cost of inventory. Instead, period costs will be referred to as period expenses since they will be reported on the income statement as selling, general and administrative (SG&A) or interest expenses.
Example of Period Costs
Selling expenses (such as commissions, salaries of sales employees, advertising), general and administrative (general office salaries, rent, utilities, etc.), and interest expense will be reported on the income statement when they are directly related to sales or when they are used up. For example, the insurance premiums that a company pays for nonmanufacturing protection will be expensed in the period in which the insurance premiums expire. (However, the insurance premiums for the manufacturing operations will become part of the product costs as the insurance premiums expire.)",what
Why is the accuracy of inventory valuation so important?,"Having an accurate valuation of inventory is important because the reported amount of inventory will affect 1) the cost of goods sold, gross profit, and net income on the income statement, and 2) the amount of current assets, working capital, total assets, and stockholders' or owner's equity reported on the balance sheet. In fact, an incorrect inventory valuation will cause two income statements to be incorrect. The reason is the ending inventory of one accounting period will automatically become the beginning inventory in the subsequent accounting period.",what
Is the rental cost of a building considered overhead?,"The rental cost of a building used in manufacturing is part of manufacturing overhead. Manufacturing overhead is an indirect product cost. Indirect product costs are allocated or assigned to products on some reasonable basis. As a result, the rental cost of a manufacturing building will cling to the products manufactured. If the goods manufactured are in inventory, some of the rent of the manufacturing facility is in inventory. When a product is sold, the manufacturing rent that is included in the product cost will be part of the cost of goods sold.
The rental cost of a building that is not used for manufacturing (e.g. rent for a sales office, rent for the general administrative office) is not part of the manufacturing overhead. This rent does not cling to the products and will not be part of the cost of an item in inventory. The rent for nonmanufacturing facilities is immediately expensed in the accounting period when the building is rented.
If a rented building is used for both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing activities, the rent should be allocated to each (perhaps on the basis of square footage).",what
What does it mean to rotate stock?,"To rotate stock means to arrange the oldest units in inventory so they are sold before the newer units. For example, a grocery store will restock its shelves by putting the oldest units in the front part of the shelves. The newest units will be placed in the back of the shelves. The hope is that the customer will select the most convenient (older) units from the front of the shelf.
It is important to rotate stock in all areas: retail display area, warehouse, factory, etc. The reason to rotate stock is to reduce the losses from deterioration and obsolescence.
Ideally, when a company rotates its stock the units are physically flowing first-in, first-out (FIFO). However, in the accounting for the cost of inventory and the cost of the goods sold, the company may use a cost flow assumption which is different from the flow of the physical units. For example, a U.S. company may use the last-in, first-out (LIFO) cost flow assumption even though it diligently rotates its stock of goods.",what
Can absorption costing cause an increase in net income?,"Absorption costing could result in an increase in net income if a company increases its production and its inventory. This occurs because fixed manufacturing overhead is allocated to more production units—some of which will be reported as inventory.
To illustrate, let's assume that a company has no beginning inventory and it has production plans for 100,000 units. Let's also assume that its annual fixed manufacturing overhead is $600,000. If 100,000 units are produced, the fixed manufacturing cost per unit will be $6 ($600,000 divided by 100,000 units). If the 100,000 units are sold for $20 each, the income statement will report sales revenues of $2,000,000 and its cost of goods sold will include $600,000 of fixed manufacturing overhead.
Now let's assume that the company decides to produce 120,000 units even though sales are expected to remain at 100,000 units. Because the fixed manufacturing overhead remains at $600,000 the cost per unit for fixed manufacturing overhead will be $5 ($600,000 divided by 120,000 units produced). In this case the company will report the same sales revenues of $2,000,000 (100,000 units sold times $20) but its cost of goods sold will include only $500,000 of fixed manufacturing overhead (100,000 units sold times $5). The company's balance sheet account Inventory will include $100,000 (20,000 units times $5) of the company's fixed manufacturing overhead.
As was illustrated above, the income statement will report a lower cost of goods sold when production and inventory increased. A smaller cost of goods sold will mean more gross profit and more net income.
Standard Costing: Fixed Manufacturing Overhead Variances
Income Statement: Manufacturer - Corporation, Multiple-Step",what
Why is inventory turnover important?,"Inventory turnover is important because a company often has a significant amount of money tied up in its inventory. If the items in inventory do not get sold, the company's money will not become available to pay its employees, suppliers, lenders, etc.
It is also possible that a company's inventory will become less in demand, perhaps become obsolete, or even deteriorate. If that occurs some of the company's money will be lost. Having slow-moving items in inventory also uses valuable space and makes the warehouse less efficient.
I assume that the risk of holding inventory was the reason for the quick ratio (also known as the acid-test ratio). In this financial ratio, inventory is excluded from the current assets that will be compared to the company's current liabilities.
While inventory is critical for meeting customers' needs, having too much of the wrong inventory items can result in financial problems.",what
What is COS?,"In accounting, the acronym COS could indicate either cost of sales or cost of services.
The income statements of many retailers and manufacturers use the phrase cost of sales instead of cost of goods sold. In other words, for these corporations COS is the same as COGS.
The income statements of some service companies will use COS to mean the cost of services. Other service companies choose to report cost of revenues, while others will include their cost of services as part of operating expenses.",what
Is standard costing GAAP?,"Standard costing was developed to assist a manufacturer plan and control its operations. Generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP require that a manufacturer's financial statements comply with the cost principle. This means that the inventories, the cost of goods sold, and the resulting net income must reflect the manufacturer's actual costs.
Standard costing will meet the GAAP requirements if the variances between the standard costs and the actual costs are properly prorated to the inventories and to the cost of goods sold prior to issuing the financial statements.",what
Why does an inventory error affect two periods?,"An inventory error affects two periods because 1) the ending inventory of one period will become the beginning inventory for the following period, and 2) the calculation of the cost of goods sold is beginning inventory + purchases – ending inventory.
We will demonstrate this with some amounts. Let's assume that a company began on December 1. During the month of December it purchased or manufactured $100,000 of goods. At the end of December 31, the company reported that its ending inventory was $15,000. As a result, its balance sheet will report inventory of $15,000 and its income statement will report cost of goods sold of $85,000. In January it purchases $130,000 of goods and at the end of January 31 it reports inventory of $20,000. It will report January's cost of goods sold as $125,000 (beginning inventory of $15,000 plus purchases of $130,000 minus ending inventory of $20,000).
Now let's assume that only one error occurred and it involved the calculation of the December 31 ending inventory. Instead of the $15,000 that had been reported, the true amount of inventory was $19,000. That meant the December 31 balance sheet understated the true cost of inventory by $4,000. It also meant that the income statement's cost of goods sold was not $85,000. Rather, the true cost of goods sold was $81,000 ($100,000 minus $19,000 of inventory). In January, the true cost of goods sold is $129,000 (beginning inventory of $19,000 plus the purchases of $130,000 minus the January 31 inventory of $20,000).
To recap, the December 31 balance sheet reported the incorrect ending inventory and the December and January income statements reported the incorrect cost of goods sold, and gross profit and net income. The true cost of goods sold for December was $81,000—not the $85,000 that was reported. The true cost of goods sold for January was $129,000—not the $125,000 that was reported. That one error in calculating the December 31 inventory cost resulted in December's cost of goods sold being too high and January's cost of goods sold being too low. That in turn meant that the reported gross profit for December was $4,000 too low and January's reported profit was $4,000 too high.",what
What are nonmanufacturing overhead costs?,"Nonmanufacturing overhead costs are the business expenses that are outside of a company's manufacturing operations. These are often referred to as the selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses plus the company's interest expense. Examples of the nonmanufacturing overhead costs include the salaries and other expenses for the following business activities: selling, distribution, marketing, finance, IT, human resources, legal, and so on. (We have additional examples within our AccountingCoach.com topic Nonmanufacturing Overhead.)
Since these costs are outside of the manufacturing function, they are not considered to be costs of the products. As a result, the nonmanufacturing costs are not allocated to the products for determining the costs for inventory or for the cost of goods sold. Instead, the nonmanufacturing costs are immediately expensed in the accounting period in which they are incurred. That is why accountants say that the nonmanufacturing costs are period costs or period expenses. (Only the manufacturing costs of direct materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead are product costs.)
While the nonmanufacturing overhead costs are not allocated to the products, the company must have its selling prices and sales revenues sufficient to cover both the product costs and the period expenses in order to avoid a negative net income.",what
Why does a company debit Purchases instead of Inventory?,"Under the periodic inventory system a company determines its inventory value based on an estimated or actual physical count of goods multiplied by the unit costs of the items. As a result, the costs of the goods purchased by the company will be debited to the temporary account Purchases. Under the periodic inventory system, there will also be temporary accounts that will be credited for Purchase Returns and Allowances and for Purchase Discounts.
If a company wants its Inventory account to have a running dollar amount, it will use the perpetual inventory system. Under the perpetual inventory system, the costs of the goods purchased are debited to Inventory. The perpetual system also requires that the Inventory account be credited for the cost of the goods sold, for purchase returns and allowances, and for purchase discounts.",what
What is cycle counting?,"Cycle counting refers to physically counting a portion of the inventory items on many days throughout the year instead of counting all of the items on a single day near the end of the year.
For example, cycle counting could mean counting one-twelfth of the inventory items each month. Therefore, each month one-twelfth of the inventory records would be adjusted so that they agree to the physical counts.
Another possibility would be to physically count the most important 15% of the inventory items every month and to cycle count the remaining 85%. Perhaps one-twelfth of the remaining 85% would be counted every month.
Cycle counting reduces the need for the costly process of shutting down the manufacturing process in order to count inventory. Cycle counting can also result in more accurate interim financial statements since inventory is a key part of a company's current assets and the calculation of its cost of goods sold.",what
What is the cost to store inventory?,"The cost to store, hold or carry inventory consists of 1) the cost of the space used including rent, heat, maintenance, etc., 2) the cost of the money tied up in inventory, 3) the cost of insurance and perhaps property tax, and 4) the cost of deterioration and obsolescence of the inventory items.
Some of the storage costs are a function of the cost or value of the inventory, while some storage costs are dependent on the physical size of the items. The costs to store or hold inventory are often stated on an annual basis, such as $3 per unit or 15% of an item's cost.
The calculation of the cost to store inventory should be based on the incremental annual costs or the company's opportunity costs. In other words, if a business has a large amount of cash, no debt, and a warehouse that is half empty, its costs to store inventory will be relatively low. Another company with little cash, much debt, and little available storage space will have relatively high costs of storing inventory.
The costs to store inventory are part of the economic order quantity (EOQ) formula or model that calculates the optimum order quantity. The economic order quantity is the number of units that will minimize the total annual costs of both ordering and storing inventory.",what
How do I determine the cost of missing inventory?,"The approximate cost of missing inventory is the difference between 1) the cost of the inventory that is actually on hand, and 2) the cost of the inventory that should be on hand based on the company's records.
If the company uses accounting software along with the perpetual inventory method (and the system is updated, reviewed, and adjusted routinely) then you can subtract the actual inventory on hand from the amounts shown by the software. The difference is the approximate amount of missing inventory.
If the perpetual inventory method is not used (or the system is not maintained properly) you can do the following:

Determine the cost of the inventory when the inventory was last counted. Perhaps this was the previous December 31.
Determine the cost of all the goods that were purchased since December31.
Combine Item 1 and Item 2 to arrive at the cost of goods available for sale.
Determine the cost of goods sold percentage. This is 100% minus the company's normal gross profit percentage. (This may appear on the income statements from the previous year.)
Multiply the cost of goods sold percentage times the sales since December 31. The result is the approximate cost of goods sold.
Subtract the approximate cost of goods sold (Item 5) from the cost of the goods available (Item 3). This is the approximate cost of goods that should be in inventory.
Determine the cost of the goods that are actually in inventory.
Subtract the cost of the goods that are actually in inventory (Item 7) from the cost of goods that should be in inventory (Item 6). The difference or shortage is the amount of missing inventory.",what
What is the effect on financial ratios when using LIFO instead of FIFO?,"During periods of significantly increasing costs, LIFO when compared to FIFO will cause lower inventory costs on the balance sheet and a higher cost of goods sold on the income statement.
This will mean that the profitability ratios will be smaller under LIFO than FIFO. The profitability ratios include profit margin, return on assets, and return on stockholders' equity.
The inventory turnover ratio will be higher when LIFO is used during periods of increasing costs. The reason is that the cost of goods sold will be higher and the inventory costs will be lower under LIFO than under FIFO.",what
Why is manufacturing overhead allocated to products?,"Manufacturing overhead, which is also known as factory overhead, burden, and indirect manufacturing costs, needs to be allocated to products for the following reasons:

Some of the goods manufactured are not sold in the same period in which they were produced.
The goods not sold must be reported at their cost in the company's asset entitled Inventory.
Accounting principles require that each product's inventory cost include both direct and indirect manufacturing costs.
Indirect costs by definition mean they are not directly traceable to a product and will require an allocation.
Some companies set their products' selling prices based on their costs. In the long run, the products' selling prices must be large enough to cover all of a company's manufacturing costs (including the indirect manufacturing costs) plus the company's selling, general and administrative expenses and a profit for the company's owners.

If a company never has inventory (because each period it sells all of its production) the allocation of manufacturing overhead could be avoided. The reason is that all of the manufacturing costs will be reported as the cost of goods sold. However, the company may still choose to allocate the manufacturing overhead for internal pricing decisions or to comply with a government contract.",what
What are LIFO layers?,"LIFO is the acronym for Last-In, First-Out. In the context of inventory, it means that the cost of the most recently purchased units will be the first costs to be matched with the recent sales on the income statement. (The oldest costs will remain in inventory.) When the end of the year quantity of inventory increases, the cost of the recently added units becomes a new layer—another LIFO layer. If the end of the year inventory quantity decreases, LIFO layers are ""peeled away"" starting with the latest (most recent) layer first. We will illustrate this with the following example.
Jay Corp. begins operations in 2011 using the LIFO cost flow assumption. It ended the year 2011 with 10 units in inventory at a cost of $20 each. Therefore its LIFO inventory consists of one layer (its base layer) having a cost of $200. During 2012 Jay Corp. purchased 100 units at $21 each and sold 95 units. Under the LIFO cost flow assumption, it is assumed that the 95 units sold had the most recent cost of $21 (even if the most recently purchased units were not physically shipped out to customers). The LIFO cost flow assumption results in the cost of the 10 units from 2011 remaining in inventory (10 X $20 = $200) and an additional layer being added in 2012. The 2012 LIFO layer will be the 2012 cost of 5 units (5 X $21 = $105). The LIFO inventory cost at the end of 2012 will be the 2011 LIFO base layer of $200 + the 2012 LIFO layer of $105...for a total LIFO inventory cost of $305.
Next, let's assume that in 2013 Jay Corp. purchases 100 units at $22 and sells 102 units. The LIFO cost flow assumption is that the 102 units sold would consist of the cost of the recently purchased 100 units at $22 plus the cost of 2 units purchased in 2012 at $21 each. In other words, Jay Corp. had to peel away part of the 2012 layer since that was the most recently added layer. This means the LIFO cost of inventory at the end of 2013 will consist of the 2011 LIFO base layer of 10 units at $20 each + the 2012 LIFO layer now at 3 units at their 2012 cost of $21 each...for a total LIFO inventory cost at the end of 2013 of $263 ($200 + $63).
If Jay Corp. increases its inventory during 2014 by 4 units at a cost of $22 each , a new 2014 LIFO layer of 4 units would be added. The LIFO cost for the inventory at the end of 2014 would be the following: the 2011 base layer (10 units at the 2011 cost of $20 each) + the 2012 LIFO layer (3 units at the 2012 cost of $21 each) + the 2014 LIFO layer (4 units at the 2014 cost of $22 each).",what
Are repairs to office equipment and factory equipment period costs?,"Repairs to office equipment are period costs. That is, the cost of the repairs to office equipment will be reported as a selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense in the period in which the repairs take place.
Repairs to factory equipment are not period costs. Rather, the costs of repairs to factory equipment are product costs. The repair costs within the factory are part of the factory overhead (also known as manufacturing overhead) which is assigned to the products when they are manufactured. When those products are sold, the costs of the products (raw materials, direct labor, and factory overhead) will be expensed as the cost of goods sold. Until the products are sold, the products' costs will be reported as the current asset Inventory.",what
What are phantom profits?,"The terms phantom profits or illusory profits are often used in the context of inventory (but can also pertain to depreciation) during periods of rising costs. The amount of phantom or illusory profit is the difference between the profit reported using historical cost—as required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)—and the profit that would have been reported if replacement cost had been used.
For example, Company X sells products that are petroleum based. The historical cost using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost flow might have resulted in $100 per unit appearing as the cost of goods sold on the recent income statement. Had the replacement cost of the product been used, the cost of goods sold might have been $145. Assuming the product was sold for $165, the financial statements will report a gross profit of $65 ($165 minus $100). If replacement cost would have been allowed and used, the gross profit would be $20 (selling price of $165 minus the replacement cost of $145). The amount of phantom or illusory profit was $45 ($65 reported minus $20 measured using replacement cost). An economist would argue that you must first replace the item before you can measure the profit. GAAP doesn't allow the use of replacement cost since that violates the (historical) cost principle.
During periods of inflation the amount of phantom or illusory profits will be reduced if the last-in, first-out (LIFO) cost flow assumption is used. The reason is that the last or more recent cost is closer to the replacement cost.
A similar situation occurs with depreciation. Under GAAP the amount of depreciation expense reported in the financial statements is based on the historical cost of the asset and is not based on the asset's replacement cost. For example, an electric utility is depreciating (and usually charging its customers) the original cost of a power plant until the plant is fully depreciated. However, the utility is using up the economic capacity of that plant and the economic capacity might have a replacement cost that is three times as much as the plant's original cost. The utility (or any manufacturer depreciating productive assets) will be reporting higher profits using depreciation expense based on old low cost instead of current replacement cost. The resulting higher profits (the difference between the depreciation under GAAp versus the depreciation based on replacement cost) are phantom or illusory profits.",what
Is depreciation an operating expense?,"Depreciation Could Be Either an Operating Expense or a Non-operating Expense
Depreciation is an operating expense if the asset being depreciated is used in an organization's main operating activities.
Depreciation is a non-operating expense if the asset being depreciated is used in a peripheral or incidental activity of an organization.
Examples of When Depreciation is an Operating Expense
Examples of depreciation being reported as part of the operating expenses on the income statement include:

Depreciation of a retailer's store displays, warehouse equipment, delivery truck, and buildings used in its selling and general administrative functions. The depreciation will be reported on the retailer's income statement in the section containing its SG&A expenses.
Depreciation of the equipment and building used in the manufacturer's selling and general administrative functions. This depreciation will be reported on the manufacturer's income statement in the section containing its SG&A expenses.
Depreciation of equipment and building used in the manufacturing of products. This depreciation will be allocated to the goods produced and is considered part of a product's indirect costs. In the period in which a product is sold, its cost (including its share of depreciation) will be reported as part of the cost of goods sold, which is likely to be the largest operating expense on a manufacturer's income statement.",what
FIFO and LIFO is best with which type of products?,"Since FIFO and LIFO pertain to the flow of products' costs, I believe the answer involves the rate of change in the costs of products. In other words, if the costs of a company's products are steady, it won't matter whether a company uses FIFO or LIFO. The reason is that the first or older costs will be similar to the latest or recent costs. On the other hand, if the costs of its products are increasing significantly, there will be significant difference in profits and inventory values between FIFO and LIFO.
In the U.S., accountants often cite LIFO as the preferred method when products' costs are changing. The reason is the matching of the latest costs of products with the sales revenues of the current period. U.S. tax  rules also allow for either FIFO or LIFO, but require that the same cost flow assumption be used on both the company's tax return and on the company's financial statements.
By using LIFO when the costs of products are increasing, the company will be matching the recent higher costs with the current period sales. This will provide not only the improved matching of costs with revenues, it will also result in lower taxable income.",what
What is inflation accounting?,"In the U.S., inflation accounting has resulted in optional supplementary disclosures on the effects of 1) general inflation, and 2) changes in the prices of specific types of assets. In other words, the main financial statements continue to report only the traditional, historical cost amounts without any adjustment for changing prices. [During the years 1979 to 1985, some supplementary disclosures on the effects of changing prices had to be included in the notes to the financial statements of the very large U.S. corporations. From 1986 until today, the supplementary disclosures are optional. Hence, the disclosures are not likely to be made.]
One reason that inflation accounting is now optional for U.S. corporations is that the U.S. inflation rate has been modest or low since 1983. Another reason is the belief that the cost of computing the disclosure amounts will be greater than the benefit to the readers of the financial statements.
To illustrate the logic of inflation accounting, let's assume that the general inflation rate and the changes in the costs of specific assets are increasing at a constant rate of 10% each year. This means that a power plant built for a cost of $1 billion will cost $10 billion at the end of a useful life of 25 years. By computing straight-line depreciation based on the historical cost, the income statement will report depreciation expense of $40 million per year ($1 billion/25 years). Obviously this is much lower than the current cost of the productive capacity being used up each year.
Similarly, if a retailer's cost of items in inventory is increasing at an annual rate of 10%, the cost of goods sold reported on the income statement (based on historical costs) will be less than the cost the company will spend in order to replace the units sold.
The use of historical costs during periods of increasing prices means that companies with large amounts of plant assets and inventory will be reporting net income that is greater than the true economic profit. As a result, the reported net income during inflationary periods is said to include illusory profit.",what
How do you calculate ending inventory?,"Physically Counting the Items in Inventory
One method for calculating the cost of a company's ending inventory is to 1) physically count the quantity of each of the items in inventory and then 2) multiply those quantities by each item's actual unit cost.
The actual unit costs must be consistent with the cost flow assumption (FIFO, weighted-average, etc.) that was elected by the company. Special attention is required for items that are on consignment or are in transit. Taking the physical counts can be very time consuming and complicated especially when inventory items are moving between operations. As a result, large companies are likely to physically count the inventory items only at the end of the accounting year.
Using the Quantities in the Company's Inventory System
A second method which can be used for interim financial statements is to calculate the ending inventory by using the quantities on the company's inventory system. Those quantities are multiplied by the actual unit costs that reflect the company's cost flow assumption. (Throughout the year the inventory system's quantities should be adjusted to agree with any physical counts. Some companies will physically count a different group of inventory items each month and compare those counts to the system's quantities.)
Estimating the Cost of the Ending Inventory
A third approach is to use the gross profit method to calculate the estimated cost of the ending inventories that will be used on the interim financial statements.",what
What does drop ship mean?,"One example of drop ship is a manufacturer shipping goods directly to one of its customers' customer (instead of delivering the goods to the customer that placed the order with the manufacturer). The following illustrates the concept of drop ship, drop shipping or a drop shipment.
Assume that XYZ Distributors Inc (XYZ) sells only the Premier brand of water heaters. XYZ receives an order for 40 of the water heaters from a condominium developer located 30 miles away. XYZ then places an order for 40 water heaters from Premier Manufacturing Corp. However, XYZ instructs Premier to deliver them directly to the condo project. So instead of delivering them to XYZ's warehouse, Premier is asked to drop ship them to the condo project. The drop ship means that XYZ will not have to receive the water heaters, unload them, reload them onto its trucks and then deliver them to the condo project. Hence the drop ship allows XYZ to avoid some expensive non-value-added activities.
When Premier ships the water heaters, it will bill XYZ and will send the invoice to XYZ. As a result XYZ will have a purchase and an account payable for the amount charged by Premier. XYZ will prepare its own sales invoice to bill the condo developer.",what
How can I determine the inventory methods used by other companies in my industry?,"You can find the inventory methods used by the companies in your industry whose stock is publicly traded by reading the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies contained in each company's Form 10-K. The Form 10-K is the annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission or SEC.
The Summary of Significant Accounting Policies will appear as the first or second item in the Notes to the Financial Statements.
Most publicly traded corporations will have an Investors Relations link at the bottom of their website's home page. On the Investors Relations page you will find a link to the corporation's SEC filings.",what
Is the sales tax on merchandise purchased for resale included in inventory?,"In our state, sales tax is paid only by the end customer. In other words, a retailer does not pay sales tax on merchandise that is purchased for resale. To avoid the sales tax, the retailer furnishes the supplier with a reseller's certificate, which allows the supplier to not charge the sales tax.
If a sales tax is paid by the reseller and the sales tax could have been avoided, the sales tax would have to be expensed immediately. Costs that are not necessary cannot be recorded as assets.
If the sales tax could not have been avoided, then the sales tax would be part of the cost of the merchandise purchased. If the merchandise has not been sold, the entire cost will be reported as inventory, a current asset on the balance sheet. If the merchandise has been sold, then the entire cost will be reported on the income statement as the cost of goods sold.",what
What accounts for the difference in inventory values between periodic LIFO and perpetual LIFO?,"The difference between periodic LIFO and perpetual LIFO involves the time at which costs are removed from inventory. Under periodic LIFO, the latest costs are assumed to be removed from inventory at the end of the year. Under, perpetual LIFO the latest costs are assumed to be removed from inventory at the time of each sale.
We will illustrate the difference by using the following information. A company's accounting year is January 1 through December 31 and the company sells only one type of product. In its beginning inventory are 2 units with a cost of $10 each. The company sells 1 unit on March 1. On April 1, the company purchases 5 units at a cost of $11 each. On September 1, the company sells 3 units. In summary, the company had 2 units on January 1, purchased 5 units on April 1, sold 4 units during the year, and has 3 units on hand at December 31.
Under periodic LIFO, the costs of the latest purchases starting with the end of the year are removed first. Since 4 units were sold during the year, the costs removed from inventory and charged to the cost of goods sold will be the latest cost of 4 units, which is $11 each. This means the cost of its December 31 inventory under periodic LIFO will be $31 (1 unit at $11 plus 2 units at $10).
Under perpetual LIFO, the costs of the latest purchases as of the date of each sale are removed first. On March 1, the latest cost at that time for the 1 unit sold was $10. At the time of the sales on September 1, the latest costs of the 3 units sold was $11 each. Under perpetual LIFO its cost of goods sold will be $43 (1 at $10 and 3 at $11), and its inventory will be reported at a cost of $32 (2 units at $11 and 1 unit at $10).",what
What is net working capital?,"Definition of Net Working Capital
Net working capital is the amount (as opposed to being a ratio) remaining after subtracting a company's total amount of current liabilities from its total amount of current assets. Hence, the formula is: net working capital = current assets minus current liabilities. (Net working capital is also known as working capital.)
Example of Net Working Capital
As an example, a company with current assets of $130,000 and current liabilities of $100,000 has $30,000 of net working capital. This amount may be sufficient for some companies but inadequate for other companies.
Difference Between Net Working Capital and Liquidity
Net working capital is often cited as one of the indicators of a company's liquidity. However, the amount of net working capital alone does not assure a company of the liquidity necessary to pay its current liabilities when they come due. For example, if a company's current assets consist mainly of slow-moving inventory and some slow-paying accounts receivable, the company may not be able to convert its current assets to a sufficient amount of cash in time to pay its obligations. Not having sufficient cash to pay employees, suppliers and other creditors may lead to serious problems.
In contrast, another company that sells fast-moving products online with customers paying with credit cards will have liquidity even with a small amount of net working capital. If this company's suppliers also have credit terms of net 60 days or the company pays its bills by using its business credit card, the company may be able to operate with negative working capital.
Managing Working Capital
In short, net working capital management is critical for a company's positive relationships with lenders, suppliers, employees and customers. All of the components of net working capital should be examined in detail and managed properly.",what
Why do companies use cost flow assumptions to cost their inventories?,"Cost flow assumptions are necessary because of inflation and the changing costs experienced by companies. If costs were completely stable, it wouldn't matter how costs were flowed.
To illustrate the cost flow assumption, let's assume that a company's product had a cost of $100 at the start of the year, at mid-year the cost was $105, and at the end of the year the cost was $110. Which cost would you match with the sale of one item at the end of the year? Would you match the $100 cost with the selling price of the unit sold? (If so, you are assuming a FIFO cost flow.) Would you match the $110 cost with the sale? (That's the LIFO cost flow assumption.) If you would matched the average of $105, you would be using the weighted-average cost flow assumption.
The cost flow assumption will also affect the inventory values. If you matched the $100 cost with the sale, the company's inventory will have the higher costs. If you matched the $110 cost with the sale, the company's inventory will have lower costs. The weighted-average cost would mean that both the inventory and the cost of goods sold would be valued at $105 per unit.
You must also realize that the cost flow assumption is independent of the physical flow of the products. This means you can rotate your company's inventory (by selling its oldest units first) and yet flow the costs by using LIFO or weighted average.
Many U.S. companies have switched their cost flow assumption from FIFO to the LIFO because they were experiencing rising costs. By flowing the recent higher costs into the cost of goods sold on the income statement and tax return (and keeping the older lower costs in inventory), they are reporting a more realistic net income and less taxable income.",what
What is a limitation of the inventory turnover ratio?,"One limitation of the inventory turnover ratio is that it tells you the average number of times per year that a company's inventory has been sold. For example, if during the past year a company had sales of $7 million, cost of goods sold of $5 million, and its inventory cost averaged $1 million, the company's inventory turnover was on average 5 ($5 million of cost of goods sold divided by $1 million of inventory cost). A turnover ratio of 5 indicates that on average the inventory had turned over every 72 or 73 days (360 or 365 days per year divided by the turnover of 5).
However, the average turnover ratio of 5 might be hiding some important details. What if four items make up 40% of the company's sales and account for only 10% of the inventory cost? These fast selling items will have a turnover ratio of 20 (cost of goods sold of $2,000,000 divided by their average inventory cost of $100,000) meaning these items turn every 18 days (360 days divided by the turnover of 20). This means that the remaining items in inventory will have a cost of goods sold of $3,000,000 and their average inventory cost will be $900,000. As a result, the majority of the items in inventory will have an average turnover ratio of 3.3 ($3,000,000 divided by $900,000). In other words, the majority of items are turning on average every 109 days (360 days divided by the turnover ratio of 3.3). That's a significant difference from the 72 days that we first computed on the totals.
People within the company can overcome the shortcomings described above, since they have access to all of the sales and inventory detail. A computer generated report can compute the inventory turnover ratio and the days' sales in inventory for each and every item sold and/or held in inventory. By reviewing each item, the slow moving items will not be hidden behind an average.",what
What is net purchases?,"Definition of Net Purchases
Net purchases is the term used for the combination of the amounts recorded in the following general ledger temporary accounts: Purchases, Purchases Discounts, and Purchases Returns and Allowances. These accounts are used by companies having inventories of goods and which use the periodic inventory system in their general ledgers.
Examples of Net Purchases
To illustrate the calculation of net purchases, let's assume that a company had the following activity:

the account Purchases shows a debit balance of $250,000 which is the gross amount of its purchases of goods that were bought to resell
the account Purchases Discount shows a credit balance of $3,000 as a result of the company earning early payment discounts that were offered by its vendors
the account Purchases Returns and Allowances has a credit balance of $9,000 resulting from vendors' credit memos received by the company

Based on the above activity the company's net purchases are $238,000 ($250,000 - $3,000 - $9,000).",what
What is a product cost?,"Definition of a Retailer's Product Cost
In accounting, a retailer’s product cost is the cost paid to a supplier plus any other costs that are necessary to get the product in place and ready for sale. For example, if a retailer pays $40 to its supplier and then pays $10 to get it delivered to its warehouse, the retailer’s product cost is $50. 
Definition of a Manufacturer's Product Cost
A manufacturer’s product cost includes the cost of each product’s raw materials plus the costs of converting the raw materials into products. The manufacturer's product costs are usually classified into three groups:

Raw materials used in the product
Direct labor used to make the product
Manufacturing overhead incurred to make the product

Since the manufacturing overhead costs are indirect costs, they must be allocated to the products manufactured to comply with financial accounting standards and U.S. income tax regulations. The details for allocating or assigning the manufacturing costs to the products manufactured are contained in the college course known as cost accounting or managerial accounting.
Product Costs Are Used for Inventory and Cost of Goods Sold
Both the product costs of a retailer and the product costs of a manufacturer are also referred to as inventoriable costs, since the product costs are used to value their goods in inventory. When the goods are sold, the product costs will be removed from inventory and will appear on the income statement as the cost of goods sold.
SG&A Not Included in Product Costs
The selling, general, administrative (SG&A) and interest costs of a retailer and/or a manufacturer are not product costs. Rather, they are reported as expenses on the income statement of the accounting period in which they were incurred.",what
Can a cost be both a direct cost and an indirect cost?,"A cost can be both a direct cost and an indirect cost. One of many examples is the cost of a supervisor in a department within a factory.
Let's assume that Sam earns $50,000 per year as the supervisor of the machining department of a factory. Sam's $50,000 is a direct cost of the machining department because Sam works only in the machining department. Hence, this $50,000 is directly traceable to the machining department.
Sam's $50,000 is also an indirect product cost. It is an indirect cost because the supervisor of the machining department is part of the factory overhead costs that must be assigned to the products. (Instead of being assigned we could say that manufacturing overhead must be allocated or applied to products by using an overhead rate.) We might also say that Sam's $50,000 is part of the factory overhead costs that must be absorbed by the products by means of a factory overhead rate.",what
What is the periodic inventory system?,"Definition of Periodic Inventory System
The periodic inventory system does not update the general ledger account Inventory when a company purchases goods to be resold. Rather than debiting Inventory, the company debits the temporary account Purchases. Any adjustments related to these purchases of goods will be credited to a general ledger contra account such as Purchases Discounts or Purchases Returns and Allowances. When the balances of these three purchases accounts are combined, the resulting amount is known as net purchases.
When goods are sold under the periodic inventory system there is no entry to credit the Inventory account or to debit the account Cost of Goods Sold. Hence, the Inventory account contains only the ending balance from the previous year. As a result, the company must compute an inventory amount at the end of each accounting period in order to report the amount of its ending inventory for its balance sheet and the cost of goods sold for its income statement.
Computing the Inventory Amount Under the Periodic Inventory Method
At the end of an accounting year, the company's ending inventory is normally computed based on a physical count of its inventory items. However, the inventory amounts for the monthly and quarterly financial statements are usually estimates. Under the periodic inventory system the cost of goods sold is computed as follows: beginning inventory (previous year's ending inventory cost) + net purchases = cost of goods available - costs computed for the ending inventory = cost of goods sold. An alternative format is: net purchases plus the decrease in inventory or minus the increase in inventory = cost of goods sold.
Inventory Records Outside of the General Ledger
It should be noted that companies using the periodic inventory system in their general ledger accounts often have sophisticated inventory systems outside of the general ledger for tracking the items it purchases, produces, sells and has on hand.",what
"When calculating inventory turnover, do you use sales or the cost of goods sold?","I calculate the inventory turnover by using the cost of goods sold. I use the cost of goods sold because inventory is in the general ledger at its cost and it is reported on the balance sheet at cost. Since inventory is the cost of goods on hand, it makes sense to relate it to the cost of goods sold.
Assume that during the past year a company's inventory had an average cost of $10,000. (This was the average of the amounts in the asset account Inventory and the average of the amounts reported on the balance sheet during the past year.) Also assume that during the year the company has sales of $60,000 and its cost of goods sold was $40,000. On average, the inventory turned over 4 times ($40,000 of cost of goods sold during the year divided by $10,000 the average cost of goods on hand during the year.)",what
What is a burden rate in inventory?,"I assume that the burden rate in inventory refers to a manufacturer's indirect manufacturing costs, which are also referred to as factory overhead, indirect production costs, and burden. In the U.S., a manufactured product's cost consists of direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead. Since manufacturing overhead is an indirect cost, it is usually assigned or allocated through an overhead rate or burden rate. Two examples of an overhead or burden rate are 1) a percentage of direct labor, and 2) an hourly cost rate assigned on the basis of machine hours.
A product's manufacturing cost, consisting of direct materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead, is used to report the cost of goods sold and also the cost of units in inventory. Therefore, if you look at the detail of a product's inventory cost, you may see the manufacturing overhead being assigned or applied to the unit through a burden rate.",what
What are byproducts?,"Byproducts, or by-products, are products with relatively little value that emerge from a common process along with the main products. The main products have significant value and are referred to as joint products. The point at which the byproducts and joint products emerge from the common process is known as the split-off point. The costs prior to the split-off point are known as the common costs.
Since the value of the byproducts is usually insignificant, the accounting for the byproducts can vary. Here are two of several methods of accounting for byproducts:

The byproducts could be valued at the split-off point at their net realizable value. This amount reduces the common costs which will be allocated to the joint products at the split-off point.
None of the common costs is assigned to the byproducts. As a result the full amount of the common costs are allocated to the joint products at the split-off point. When the byproducts are sold, the amount received is reported as revenues.",what
Is a utility bill an expense?,"The utility bill for a retailer or for a service company is an expense. Under the accrual basis of accounting, the utility bill is an expense for the period indicated by the meter reading dates.
A manufacturer's utility bill is more complicated. The utility bill for its selling and general administration will be an expense for the period indicated by the meter reading dates. However, the utility bill for the direct and indirect manufacturing operations is part of its manufacturing overhead. As such, the utility bill will be assigned or allocated to the units produced. In other words, the utility bill will be clinging to the units produced. Some of the utility cost will be clinging to the units in inventory and therefore will be part of the cost of the asset inventory. Some of the utility cost will be clinging to the units that have been sold and will be part of the expense known as the cost of goods sold.",what
What are the disclosures for a manufacturer's inventory?,"A manufacturer should disclose the following categories of inventory: raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods, manufacturing supplies, and packaging supplies. When some of these amounts are not significant, some categories may be combined, such as raw materials and supplies, or raw materials and work-in-process.
In addition, a manufacturer (and others with inventory) should disclose the method for valuing the inventory. This includes whether it is cost or the lower of cost or net realizable value, and also the cost flow assumption such as 1) first-in, first-out or FIFO, 2) last-in, first-out or LIFO, 3) weighted average, etc. If LIFO is used, the company must disclose what the dollar amount of inventory would have been if FIFO had been used.",what
Where is a manufacturer's inventory reported in the balance sheet?,"A manufacturer's inventory will be reported in the current assets section of the balance sheet and in the notes to the financial statements. In the current assets section the amount of the manufacturer's inventory will be positioned after cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and receivables.
If only the sum of the manufacturer's inventory categories is listed in the current assets section, then the notes to the financial statements will report the detailed amounts for raw materials and supplies, work-in-process and finished goods.
The notes to the financial statements will also described how the manufacturer's inventory is valued. For example, the notes will disclose whether FIFO lower of cost or market, LIFO, weighted average, or other cost flow methods were used. If LIFO is used, then the excess of current cost over LIFO cost is also disclosed.",what
What is purchase discounts lost?,"The account Purchase Discounts Lost is found in the general ledger of a company that records vendors' invoices using the net method. An amount is entered in Purchase Discounts Lost only when the company fails to pay an invoice within the vendor's discount period.
To illustrate the net method and Purchase Discounts Lost, let's assume that a retailer's policy is to always pay a vendor's legitimate invoice within its discount period if the invoice offers an early payment discount. Let's also assume that one vendor's invoice is for $1,000 and has terms of 2/10, net 30 days. After reviewing and approving the invoice, the retailer will debit Purchases (or Inventory) for $980 ($1,000 minus 2% discount) and will credit Accounts Payable for $980.
If the retailer pays the vendor $980 within the 10-day discount period, it will be recorded with a debit to Accounts Payable for $980 and a credit to Cash for $980. However, if the retailer fails to pay the invoice within the discount period, the retailer will need to remit $1,000 to the vendor. In that case the retailer will credit Cash for $1,000; debit Accounts Payable for $980; and debit Purchase Discounts Lost for $20. Purchase Discounts Lost is considered to be an expense (as opposed to being a cost of the goods). The cost of the goods remains at $980 (the cash price) because in accounting cost is defined as cash or the cash equivalent amount. The $20 is viewed as interest expense or a financing charge since the retailer was apparently unable to remit the cash price of $980 within the discount period.",what
Is the sales tax paid on merchandise that you will resell an expense?,"I believe that most states have sales tax exemptions for merchandise purchased for resale. Check with your state's sales tax department to see if you can obtain a resellers permit to avoid being charged the sales tax by your suppliers.
If you purchase an asset and the sales tax is required, the sales tax should be recorded as part of the cost of the goods or services received. For example, if you were required to pay sales tax on the new company car, the cost of the car will include the sales tax. If you purchased supplies and the cost of the supplies was subject to sales tax, the sales tax is part of the cost of the supplies. If you received services that were subject to the sales tax, the sales tax is a necessary part of the cost of the services.",what
What is NIFO?,"NIFO is the acronym for next-in, first-out.
NIFO is a cost flow assumption, just as FIFO and LIFO are cost flow assumptions. However, NIFO is not acceptable for financial reporting since it calls for a future cost. NIFO is sometimes used as an expression of replacement cost.
Even though NIFO cannot be used for valuing inventory and the cost of goods sold on the financial statements, it is useful for making decisions. For example, some companies will use NIFO when determining selling prices.",what
"Why can a retailer record its purchase of merchandise as a debit to purchases within the cost of goods sold, instead of the asset inventory?","Before we explain why companies will record the purchases of merchandise in the Purchases account instead of the Inventory account, let's agree that the objective of the accounting process is to have accurate financial statements. In this case we want an income statement which reports an accurate amount of cost of goods sold, and the resulting gross profit and net income. We need the balance sheet to report an accurate cost of inventory, and the resulting amount of current assets, working capital, total assets, and stockholders' equity. I believe this objective will require some type of an adjustment to the the Inventory account balance and to the cost of goods sold regardless of how the purchases of merchandise were initially recorded.
Now for the reason companies often record purchases in a purchases account. Generally, companies will have a relatively stable amount of inventory and the cost of its annual purchases will be many times the cost of its inventory. This means that most of the cost of its purchases will appear as the cost of goods sold on its income statement. For the minor change in the cost of inventory from the beginning to the end of the accounting period, an adjustment can be made. For example, let's assume that the cost of purchases during the year amounted to $560,000. Let's also assume that the inventory at the end of the year has a cost of $70,000 compared to the inventory cost of $67,000 at the end of the previous accounting year. An adjustment will be entered to debit the Inventory account for $3,000 which will increase the Inventory account balance from $67,000 to $70,000. The credit portion of the entry of $3,000 will cause the cost of goods sold to be reported as $557,000 ($560,000 of debits in the Purchases account during the year minus the amount that increased the cost of inventory: $3,000). After this adjustment, the balance sheet will report the true cost of the ending inventory of $70,000 and the income statement will report the true cost of goods sold of $557,000.",what
What is lead time in purchasing?,"In purchasing, lead time is the estimated time between ordering goods and receiving the goods. For instance, if 100 units of Product X are ordered on April 11 and are expected to be received on April 25, the lead time is 14 days.
The estimated lead time is one of the factors used in calculating the reorder point of items carried in inventory.",what
What is obsolete inventory?,"Definition of Obsolete Inventory
Obsolete inventory refers to products that a company had purchased or produced which cannot be sold. The obsolete items may be the result of one or more of the following:

Innovations that make the products worthless, inconvenient, unattractive, etc.
New technologies that disrupt the way things are done
Decline in overall demand for the items
Arrival of unique competitors

Consequences of Obsolete Inventory
When inventory items become obsolete, the reality is that their value is significantly lower than their cost. As a result, the U.S. accounting rules require that the cost of the obsolete inventory items be reduced to their net realizable value. Failure to reduce their cost will mean that the following amounts on the company's financial statements will be overstated:

Inventory
Current assets
Working capital
Profits
Owner’s or stockholders’ equity

Benefits of Disposing of Obsolete Inventory
Since the value of the obsolete items may continue to decrease, it is wise to dispose of the items at any price as soon as possible. The benefits of disposing of the obsolete items will result in the company:

Having realistic financial statements
Being eligible for a U.S. income tax benefit
Having less inventory holding costs
Being confronted with the total cost of holding items in inventory",what
What is the cost of goods available?,"Definition of Cost of Goods Available
For non-manufacturing companies using the periodic inventory system in its general ledger, the cost of goods available (COGA, or cost of goods available for sale) for a year is the sum of the following: the costs in the beginning inventory (the prior year's ending inventory) + the cost of the current year's net purchases.
Allocating Cost of Goods Available to Inventory and Cost of Goods Sold
At the end of the year, the cost of goods available amount must be allocated or divided between:

Products or goods that are in ending inventory. This allocated amount will be reported on the end-of-the-year balance sheet.
Products or goods that have been sold during the year. This allocated amount will appear on the income statement for the year as cost of goods sold (COGS).

The allocation of the total amount of COGA between ending inventory and COGS will differ depending on a company's cost flow assumption. Three examples of cost flow assumptions are:

FIFO which assigns the recent unit costs of the purchases to inventory and the oldest unit costs to COGS.
LIFO which assigns the recent unit costs of the purchases to COGS and the oldest unit costs will remain in inventory.
Weighted-average which calculates a weighted-average unit cost based on each and all of the units in the COGA and then applies those unit costs to both the units in inventory and the units that have been sold.",what
What is the reorder point?,"The reorder point is the quantity of units in inventory that will trigger an order to purchase additional units. Let's assume that a company's reorder point for its Product X is 80 units. When the inventory of Product X drops to 80 units, the company places an order for additional units of Product X.
The reorder point is calculated by 1) estimating the sales in the near future, 2) estimating the number of days between ordering and receiving the additional units, and 3) the number of units of safety stock.
The reorder point indicates when to place an order. The economic order quantity indicates the optimum number of units to be ordered.",what
How can I determine the difference in earnings from using LIFO instead of FIFO?,"The difference in a corporation's earnings from using LIFO instead of FIFO can be determined by the amounts reported in the balance sheet account LIFO Reserve. Generally, the LIFO Reserve information is found in the notes to the financial statements.",what
What is illusory profit?,"Illusory profit, also called phantom profit, is the difference between 1) the profit reported using historical costs required by US GAAP, and 2) the profit computed using replacement costs. Illusory profit is greatest during periods of rising costs at companies with significant amounts of inventory and plant assets.
For example, when inventory is measured by using the first-in, first-out cost flow assumption under US GAAP, the actual historical cost of inventory that is charged to the cost of goods sold during periods of rising costs is smaller than the amount computed using replacement costs. This smaller amount of costs charged to the income statement means reporting greater profit. The difference in the profit is said to be illusory.
In the case of plant assets used during periods of rising costs, the depreciation expense reported on the income statement based on historical costs (required by US GAAP) will be less than the depreciation computed by using the higher replacement cost of the plant assets. The additional profit from this difference in depreciation is considered to be illusory profit.",what
What is meant by overabsorbed?,"Overabsorbed is usually used in the context of a manufacturer's production overhead costs. Since manufacturing overhead costs are not directly traceable to products, they need to be allocated, assigned, or applied to the products through an overhead rate. We also state that the products absorb the overhead costs through the overhead rate.
The overhead rate is normally a predetermined rate—meaning that it was calculated prior to the start of the accounting year by using 1) the expected amount of overhead costs, and 2) the expected volume of production. Because of these two estimates, it is unlikely that the amount of overhead allocated, applied, assigned, or absorbed will be equal to the actual overhead costs incurred.
If the actual products manufactured are assigned or absorb more overhead through the overhead rate than the actual amount of overhead costs incurred, the products have overabsorbed the overhead costs.
At the end of the accounting year, the amount of the overapplied, overassigned, or overabsorbed overhead is often credited to the cost of goods sold. The reasons are 1) the overabsorbed amount is not significant, and 2) most of the products absorbing too much overhead costs have been sold. If the overabsorbed amount is significant, then the amount overabsorbed must be prorated or allocated as a reduction to the cost of the inventories and to the cost of goods sold based on where the overabsorbed overhead costs are residing at the end of the accounting year.",what
What type of expense is the purchase of propane?,"Technically, the purchase of propane is not an expense. Depending on the business, the propane is an asset until it is used, resold, or included in a product that is sold. At that time it will become an expense.
If the purchased propane is used relatively soon, accountants will usually skip recording the asset. Here are three examples of how the expense might be reported on the company's income statement.
Example 1. A service company purchases $900 of propane to heat its office for the following month. Technically the propane is an asset until used. However, the accountant is likely to skip recording of the asset and will record the purchase as a $900 operating expense.
Example 2. A local dealer purchases large quantities of propane and then delivers the propane in small quantities to its customers. The dealer will record the purchase as the asset Propane Inventory. As the propane is sold, the dealer will reduce Propane Inventory for the cost of the propane sold and will increase the expense Cost of Goods Sold.
Example 3. A manufacturer uses propane in its factory operations. The cost of the propane purchased is likely to be recorded as Manufacturing Overhead. Manufacturing Overhead is allocated to the products manufactured and will be part of the products' cost. If the products are in Inventory, those products' costs are assets. If the products are sold, those products' costs will be expensed as Cost of Goods Sold.",what
Why does a cost system developed for inventory valuation distort product cost information?,"The cost system for inventory valuation may have been developed to provide a reasonable total cost of inventory and a reasonable total cost of goods sold in order to have reasonably accurate financial statements. If a company has small inventory amounts and significant sales, a simple cost system that spreads manufacturing overhead costs solely on the basis of machine hours can result in a reasonably accurate balance sheet and income statement.
While a simple cost system using just one cost driver (machine hours) may result in accurate financial statements, it often fails to provide the true cost of individual products that vary in complexity. For example, one product might require very few machine hours but will require many hours of special handling. The costs assigned on the basis of machine hours alone will be too low in relationship to the true cost of manufacturing this product. Another product might require many machine hours but no other activities. This product's cost will be overstated because the rate assigned via the machine hours will include an amount for other activities that generally occur for the other products manufactured.
A cost system developed for inventory valuation is limited to the cost of direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead. The total cost of providing products to a customer will also include nonmanufacturing expenses. One customer might require a company to incur additional selling, delivering, storing, and administrative expenses. Another customer might not require any of those activities and their related expenses.
Activity based costing attempts to calculate the true cost of a product and customer by assigning costs and expenses based on their root causes. Because there are many root causes, the company will assign costs based on many cost drivers. This results in more accuracy for the cost and expense of a specific product for a specific customer than simply spreading the manufacturing costs on the basis of one cost driver such as machine hours.",what
Are there two ABC methods in accounting?,"Some accountants use ABC to mean Activity Based Costing. Under this ABC a manufacturer will use many cost drivers to assign overhead costs to products. The objective of Activity Based Costing is to assign the overhead costs based on their root causes rather than merely spreading the costs on the basis of direct labor hours or production machine hours.
A second use of ABC involves categorizing inventory items into ""A"" items, ""B"" items, and ""C"" items. The ""A"" items are a relatively small number of items which account for the majority of the inventory's value. For example, the ""A"" items might be 20% of the items in inventory which account for 70% of the inventory value. At the other extreme the ""C"" items might be 60% of the items in inventory but they account for only 10% of the inventory value. The ""B"" items might be 20% of the items accounting for 20% of the inventory value. Under this system, the ""A"" items will receive the most attention since they account for 70% of the value. This ABC is sometimes referred to as Pareto analysis or Pareto's rule and it can be applied to more than inventory. For example, 20% of a company's customers might account for 70% of the company's sales.",what
What is the FISH inventory method?,"FISH is the acronym for first-in, still-here. FISH is an attempt to bring humor to the fact that some items have been sitting in inventory for years.
Unlike FIFO and LIFO, which are cost flow assumptions, FISH is simply a reference to the physical presence of old, unsold items in inventory.
If the same items have been sitting in inventory for years, there are potential accounting issues. For example, the value of the items may be less than their costs due to obsolescence or deterioration. In addition, the company continues to incur other costs of holding inventory such as the cost of capital, space, insurance, etc.",what
Are LIFO inventory amounts ever written-up to their market value?,"LIFO inventory amounts will not be written-up, even when the current market value of the inventory is far greater than the amount reported on the balance sheet.
The reason inventory is not increased to its current value is the cost principle, the cost flow assumption, consistency, and other accounting concepts and principles. When a company elects the LIFO cost flow assumption, it chooses to put its most recent costs in the cost of goods sold, and to leave its earlier costs in inventory. The company cannot violate the cost principle by later increasing the inventory to an amount that is greater than those earlier actual costs.
One place that you might find part of the difference between the LIFO cost reported on the balance sheet and its current market value is the ""Inventories"" footnote to the financial statements. For example, in General Electric's 2011 Annual Report to the SEC (Form 10-K), it indicates that if General Electric had not been using LIFO (for many years), its balance sheet inventory amount would have been greater by $450 million. That does not mean that the difference between its inventory cost and its market value is $450 million, but I suspect that it is part of the difference.",what
What is manufacturing overhead and what does it include?,"Definition of Manufacturing Overhead
Manufacturing overhead (also known as factory overhead, factory burden, production overhead) involves a company's manufacturing operations. It includes the costs incurred in the manufacturing facilities other than the costs of direct materials and direct labor. Hence, manufacturing overhead is referred to as an indirect cost.
Generally accepted accounting principles require that a manufacturer's inventory and the cost of goods sold shall consist of:

the cost of direct materials
the cost of direct labor
the cost of manufacturing overhead

Note: Expenses that are outside of the manufacturing facilities, such as selling, general and administrative expenses, are not product costs and are not inventoriable. They are reported as expenses on the income statement in the accounting period in which they occur.
Examples of Manufacturing Overhead
Some examples of manufacturing overhead costs include the following:

depreciation, rent and property taxes on the manufacturing facilities
depreciation on the manufacturing equipment
managers and supervisors in the manufacturing facilities
repairs and maintenance employees in the manufacturing facilities
electricity and gas used in the manufacturing facilities
indirect factory supplies, and much more

Because manufacturing overhead is an indirect cost, accountants are faced with the task of assigning or allocating overhead costs to each of the units produced. This is a challenging task because there may be no direct relationship. For example, the property taxes and insurance on the manufacturing buildings are based on the assets' value and not on the number of units manufactured. Yet these and other indirect costs must be allocated to the units manufactured.",what
What is a flexible budget?,"Definition of a Flexible Budget
A flexible budget is a budget that adjusts or flexes with changes in volume or activity. The flexible budget is more sophisticated and useful than a static budget. (The static budget amounts do not change. They remain unchanged from the amounts established at the time that the static budget was prepared and approved.)
For costs that vary with volume or activity, the flexible budget will flex because the budget will include a variable rate per unit of activity instead of one fixed total amount. In short, the flexible budget is a more useful tool when measuring a manager's efficiency.
Example of a Flexible Budget
Let's assume a company determines that its cost of electricity and supplies will vary by approximately $10 for each machine hour (MH) used. It also knows that other costs are fixed costs of approximately $40,000 per month. Typically, the machine hours are between 4,000 and 7,000 hours per month. Based on this information, the flexible budget for each month would be $40,000 + $10 per MH.
Now let's illustrate the flexible budget by using different levels of volume. If 5,000 machine hours were necessary for the month of January, the flexible budget for January will be $90,000 ($40,000 fixed + $10 x 5,000 MH). If the machine hours in February are 6,300 hours, then the flexible budget for February will be $103,000 ($40,000 fixed + $10 x 6,300 MH). If March has 4,100 machine hours, the flexible budget for March will be $81,000 ($40,000 fixed + $10 x 4,100 MH).",what
What is the difference between product costs and period costs?,"A manufacturer's product costs are the direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead used in making its products. (Manufacturing overhead is also referred to as factory overhead, indirect manufacturing costs, and burden.) The product costs of direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead are also ""inventoriable"" costs, since these are the necessary costs of manufacturing the products.
Period costs are not a necessary part of the manufacturing process. As a result, period costs cannot be assigned to the products or to the cost of inventory. The period costs are usually associated with the selling function of the business or its general administration. The period costs are reported as expenses in the accounting period in which they 1) best match with revenues, 2) when they expire, or 3) in the current accounting period. In addition to the selling and general administrative expenses, most interest expense is a period expense.",what
What is absorption costing?,"Definition of Absorption Costing
Absorption costing (or full absorption costing) indicates that all of the manufacturing costs have been assigned to (or absorbed by) the units produced. In other words, the cost of a finished product will include the costs of:

direct materials
direct labor
variable manufacturing overhead
fixed manufacturing overhead

Absorption costing is required for external financial reporting and for income tax reporting.
Another method of costing (known a direct costing or variable costing) does not assign the fixed manufacturing overhead costs to products.
Standard Costing: Fixed Manufacturing Overhead Variances
Standard Costing: Variable Manufacturing Overhead Variances",what
What is cost accounting?,"Definition of Cost Accounting
Cost accounting is involved with the following:

Determining the costs of products, processes, projects, etc. in order to report the correct amounts on a company's financial statements, and
Assisting management in the planning and control of the organization
Preparing special analyses that assists in making the best decisions

Examples of Cost Accounting
A significant part of cost accounting involves the unit cost of a manufacturer's products in order to report the cost of inventory on its balance sheet and the cost of goods sold on its income statement. This is achieved with techniques such as the allocation of manufacturing overhead costs and through the use of process costing, operations costing, and job-order costing systems.
Cost accounting assists management to plan and control the business through budgeting for operations, capital budgeting for expanding operations, standard costing and the reporting of variances, transfer pricing, etc.
Special analyses includes cost behavior, cost-volume-profit relationships, make or buy decisions, selling prices for products, activity-based costing, and more.
Cost accounting had its roots in manufacturing businesses. However, today it extends to service businesses. For example, a bank will use cost accounting to determine the cost of processing a customer's check and/or a deposit, maintaining a checking account, processing international wire transfers, servicing a mortgage loan, etc. This in turn may provide management with guidance in the pricing of various services.",what
What is job order costing?,"Definition of Job Order Costing
Job order costing or job costing is a system for assigning and accumulating manufacturing costs of an individual unit of output. The job order costing system is used when the various items produced are sufficiently different from each other and each has a significant cost. (When a company's output consists of continuous flows of identical, low-cost units, the process costing system is more appropriate.)
Since there is a significant variation in the items manufactured, the job order costing system requires a separate job cost record for each item (or each job or special order). The job cost record will report each item's direct materials and direct labor that were actually used and an assigned amount of manufacturing overhead.
The job cost records also serve as the subsidiary ledger or documentation for the manufacturer's cost of the work-in-process inventory, the finished goods inventory, and the cost of goods sold.
Examples of Job Order Costing
A few examples of the use of job order costing are:

A company that designs and produces custom-made machines and/or machine tooling
A company that constructs custom-designed buildings
A company that modifies trucks to meet customers' special needs",what
What are conversion costs?,"Definition of Conversion Costs
Conversion costs is a term used in cost accounting that represents the combination of direct labor costs and manufacturing overhead costs. In other words, conversion costs are a manufacturer's product or production costs other than the cost of a product's direct materials. 
Expressed another way, conversion costs are the manufacturing or production costs necessary to convert raw materials into products.
The term conversion costs often appears in the calculation of the cost of an equivalent unit in a process costing system.
Examples of Conversion Costs
An example of direct labor are the employees working on the assembly line of a manufacturer.
Examples of manufacturing overhead include the utilities, indirect labor, repairs and maintenance, depreciation, etc. that is occurring within a company's manufacturing facilities.",what
What is process costing?,"Definition of Process Costing
Process costing is a term used in cost accounting to describe one method for collecting and assigning manufacturing costs to the units produced. A processing cost system is used when nearly identical units are mass produced. (Job costing or job order costing is a system used to collect and assign manufacturing costs to units that vary from one another.)
Example of Process Costing
Let's assume that a company manufactures large quantities of an identical product. The product requires several processing operations, each of which occurs in a separate department. In the first department, the following processing costs were incurred during the month of June:

Direct materials of $150,000
Conversion costs of $225,000

If the equivalent of 100,000 units were processed in June, the per unit costs will be $1.50 for direct materials and $2.25 for conversion costs. These costs will then be transferred to second department where its processing costs will be added.",what
What is the difference between a cost center and a profit center?,"Definition of Cost Center
A cost center is a subunit of a company that is responsible only for its costs. A few examples of cost centers are:

Production departments within a factory
Service departments within a factory
Administrative departments such as IT and accounting
Definition of a Profit Center
A profit center is a subunit of a company that is responsible for revenues and costs. If a division of a company has responsibility for revenues, costs, and the resulting profits, it is a profit center.
Additional Comments
Cost centers and profit centers are usually associated with planning and control in a decentralized company.",what
What is a fringe benefit rate?,"Definition of Fringe Benefit Rate
A fringe benefit rate is a percentage that results from dividing the cost of an employee's fringe benefits by the wages paid to the employee for the hours actually worked.
Example of Fringe Benefit Rate
Let's assume that a company operates 5 days a week for 8 hours a day for 52 weeks a year resulting in a total of 2,080 hours per year. Next, let's assume that during the year an employee earns $20 per hour, and is entitled to 25 days or 200 hours off with pay (vacation, holidays, sick days). Therefore, the employee's wages for working on the job will be 1,880 hours per year (2,080 hours minus 200 hours) multiplied by $20 per hour = $37,600 for a year.
Next let's assume the following are the annual costs for the fringe benefits earned by the employee and paid by the employer:

$4,000 for paid time off (200 hours X $20)
$7,000 for the employee's health, life and disability insurances
$2,000 for the employee's retirement benefits
$1,000 for worker compensation insurance and unemployment tax
$3,000 for the employer's portion of the Social Security and Medicare taxes

The sum of the above fringe benefit costs paid by the employer is $17,000 for the year.
Dividing the annual fringe benefits cost of $17,000 by the employee's $37,600 of wages for the hours worked, results in a fringe benefit rate of 45.2%. Therefore, when a company pays the employee gross wages of $20 per hour worked, the company's cost is $29.04 per hour. (This is the $20 of gross wages per hour plus the $9.04 fringe benefit cost per hour.) Similarly, the employee is earning $29.04 for every hour worked.",what
What is a cost center?,"Definition of Cost Center
A cost center is often a department within a company. The manager and employees of a cost center are responsible for its costs but are not directly responsible for revenues or investment decisions.
Examples of Cost Centers
A manufacturer's cost centers will often include:

Each of its production departments
Each of the service departments or support departments within a production facility, such as the maintenance department and quality control department
A company's general, selling and administrative (SG&A) departments such as the company's human resource department, sales and marketing departments, IT department, accounting department, etc.

It is also possible for a company to have several cost centers within one department. For example, each assembly line could be a separate cost center within one production department. Even a special machine could be a separate cost center.
Cost centers are usually associated with the topics of decentralization, responsibility accounting, and planning and control.",what
Are salaries and wages part of expenses on the income statement?,"Definition of Salaries and Wages
Salaries and wages are forms of compensation paid to employees of a company.
Salaries and Wages as Expenses on Income Statement
Salaries and wages of a company's employees working in nonmanufacturing functions (e.g. selling, general administration, etc.) are part of the expenses reported on the company's income statement. Under the accrual method of accounting, the amounts are reported in the accounting period in which the employees earn the salaries and wages.
Salaries and Wages of Employees in Manufacturing
At a manufacturing company, the salaries and wages of employees in the manufacturing operations are assigned to the products manufactured. When the products are sold, the costs assigned to those products (including the manufacturing salaries and wages) are included in the cost of goods sold, which is reported on the income statement. (The costs of the products that are not sold are reported as inventory on the balance sheet. Hence, the inventory will contain some of the manufacturing salaries and wages.
The salaries and wages of people in the nonmanufacturing functions such as selling, general administrative, etc. are reported directly on the current income statement as expenses in the period in which they were earned by the employees.",what
What is the difference between actual overhead and applied overhead?,"Definition of Actual Overhead
In the context of actual and applied overhead, actual overhead refers to a manufacturer's indirect manufacturing costs. (Costs that are outside of the manufacturing operations, such as marketing and general management, are expenses of the accounting period and are not applied or assigned to products.)
Actual overhead are the manufacturing costs other than direct materials and direct labor. Since the overhead costs are not directly traceable to products, the overhead costs must be allocated, assigned, or applied to goods produced.
Examples of Actual Overhead
A few of the many overhead costs are:

Electricity used to power the production equipment
Natural gas to heat the production facilities
Depreciation of the production equipment and facilities
Normal repairs and maintenance of the production equipment
Salaries and benefits for production supervisors

These actual costs will be recorded in general ledger accounts as the costs are incurred.
Definition of Applied Overhead
Applied overhead is the amount of the manufacturing overhead that is assigned to the goods produced. This is usually done by using a predetermined annual overhead rate.
Example of Applied Overhead
Let's assume that a company expects to have $800,000 of overhead costs in the upcoming year. It also expects that it will have its normal 16,000 of production machine hours during the upcoming year. As a result, the company will apply, allocate, or assign overhead to the goods manufactured using a predetermined overhead rate of $50 ($800,000 divided by 16,000) for every production machine hour used.
Since the future overhead costs and future number of machine hours were not known with certainty, and since the actual machine hours will not occur uniformly throughout the year, there will always be a difference between the actual overhead costs incurred and the amount of overhead applied to the manufactured goods. Hopefully, the differences will be not be significant at the end of the accounting year.",what
How do I compute the units of production method of depreciation?,"Definition of Units of Production Depreciation
The units of production method of depreciation (which is also referred to as the units of activity method) assumes that an asset's useful life is more related to its usage rather than the mere passage of time. Under the units of production method, depreciation during a given year will be greater when there is a higher volume of activity. In times of low usage the asset's depreciation will be less.
Example of Calculating Units of Production Depreciation
To illustrate the units of production method, let's assume that a company has a machine with a cost of $500,000 and a useful life that is expected to end after producing 240,000 units of a component part. Further, the machine's salvage value at that point is assumed to be $20,000.
Given the above assumptions, the amount to be depreciated is $480,000 ($500,000 minus $20,000). Dividing the $480,000 by the machine's useful life of 240,000 units, the depreciation will be $2 per unit. If the machine produces 10,000 units in the first year, the depreciation for the year will be $20,000 ($2 x 10,000 units). If the machine produces 50,000 units in the next year, the depreciation will be $100,000 ($2 x 50,000 units). The depreciation will be calculated similarly each year until the asset's Accumulated Depreciation reaches $480,000.
The units of production method or units of activity method could be useful for depreciating airplanes and vehicles (based on miles used), printing machines (based on pages run), DVDs (based on number of times rented), etc.",what
What is cost allocation?,"Definition of Cost Allocation
Cost allocation is the assigning of a cost to several cost objects such as products or departments. The cost allocation is needed because the cost is not directly traceable to a specific object. Since the cost is not directly traceable, the resulting allocation is somewhat arbitrary. Because of the arbitrariness, some people describe cost allocation as the spreading of a cost.
Accountants have made efforts to improve the cost allocation techniques. Over time, manufacturers' overhead allocations have moved from a plant-wide rates to departmental rates. Some allocations that were allocated on the basis of direct labor hours are now based on machine hours. In order to improve those bases of allocations, some accountants are implementing activity based costing. The goal is to reduce the arbitrariness by identifying the various root causes of the overhead costs.
Examples of Cost Allocations
The following are only a few of the many cost allocations that occur in some companies or organizations:

The cost of a manufacturing building is allocated to each of the years that the building is expected to be used. Each year's depreciation is allocated to the departments that use the building. Each department's allocated cost is then allocated/assigned to the products that are processed in the department.
The electricity that is used in the production facility as measured by a single meter is allocated to the departments using the electricity. Each department's electricity is then allocated/assigned to the products processed in the department.
The cost of raw land that was purchased for $1 million is going to be developed into 80 residential lots of various sizes and 10 business lots of different sizes. The $1 million cost must be allocated to the resulting 90 lots in a meaningful way so that the developer can report the profit of selling two residential lots and the largest of the business lots. The basis for the allocation is likely to be the net realizable values of the lots.
The annual salary and benefits of an employee that spends time in three main functions of a nonprofit organization.",what
What are manufacturing costs?,"Definition of Manufacturing Costs
Manufacturing costs are the costs of materials plus the costs to convert the materials into products. All manufacturing costs must be assigned to the units produced in order for a company's external financial statements to comply with U.S. GAAP.
The resulting unit costs are used for inventory valuation and for the calculation of the cost of goods sold.
Example of Manufacturing Costs
Manufacturing costs are typically divided into three categories: 

Direct materials, which is the cost of the materials that are traceable to the product, such as the aluminum in beverage cans
Direct labor , which are the wages and fringe benefits earned by the individuals who are physically involved in converting raw materials into a finished product
Manufacturing overhead, which includes all of the other costs incurred in the manufacturing activities. These indirect costs include repairs and maintenance, depreciation of the manufacturing equipment, utilities, salaries of manufacturing supervisors, etc.",what
What is responsibility accounting?,"Definition of Responsibility Accounting
Responsibility accounting involves the internal accounting and budgeting for each responsibility center within a company. The objective of responsibility accounting is to assist in the planning and control of a company's responsibility centers.
Example of Responsibility Accounting
Typically each decentralized department and division within a company will receive a monthly report showing its budgeted and actual amounts for the most recent month as well as the year-to-date budgeted and actual amounts.",what
What are direct costs?,"Definition of Direct Costs
Direct costs are directly traceable to a cost object such as a product or a department. In other words, direct costs do not have to be allocated to a product, department, or other cost object. (A cost that must be allocated to a product, department, or other cost object is an indirect cost.)
Examples of Direct Costs
Assume that a company produces artisan furniture. The following are direct product costs and they are direct production department costs:

The cost of the wood
The cost of the craftsperson working on the furniture

The other costs of producing the furniture are indirect product costs, since they must be allocated to the furniture based on labor hours, machine hours, or some other activities. However, the indirect product costs could be direct production department costs.",what
What is the difference between depreciation expense and accumulated depreciation?,"Definition of Depreciation Expense
Depreciation expense is the amount of depreciation that is reported on the income statement. In other words, it is the amount of an asset's cost that has been allocated and reported as an expense for the period (year, month, etc.) shown in the income statement's heading.
Definition of Accumulated Depreciation
Accumulated depreciation reports the total amount of depreciation that has been reported on all of the income statements from the time that the assets were put into service until the date of the balance sheet. The account Accumulated Depreciation is a contra asset account because it will have a credit balance. The credit balance is reported in the property, plant and equipment section of the balance sheet and it reduces the cost of the assets to their carrying value or book value.
Example of Depreciation Expense and Accumulated Depreciation
To illustrate, let's assume that a retailer purchases new display racks at a cost of $84,000. This asset is estimated to have a useful life of 7 years (84 months) and no salvage value at the end of 7 years. Assuming the retailer uses the straight-line depreciation method, during each month of the display racks' lives the retailer's monthly income statement will report depreciation expense of $1,000. However, the credit balance in Accumulated Depreciation will be reported on the balance sheet at $1,000 at the end of the first month, $2,000 at the end of the second month, $3,000 at the end of the third month, etc. until the balance in Accumulated Depreciation reaches $84,000 at the end of the 84th month.",what
What is the difference between prime costs and conversion costs?,"Cost Categories of a Manufactured Product
Prime costs and conversion costs pertain to the three cost categories of a manufactured product:

Direct materials
Direct labor
Manufacturing overhead 

Definition of Prime Costs
Prime costs are the combination of the two direct product costs:

Direct materials costs
Direct labor costs

Definition of Conversion Costs
Conversion costs are the two categories of manufacturing costs that are needed to convert the direct materials into products:

Direct labor costs
Manufacturing overhead costs

As you can see, the direct labor costs are considered to be both a prime cost and a conversion cost.",what
What is a responsibility center?,"Definition of Responsibility Center
A responsibility center is a part or subunit of a company in which the manager has some degree of authority and responsibility. The company's detailed organization chart is a logical source for identifying responsibility centers. The most common responsibility centers are the numerous departments within a company.
Examples of Responsibility Centers
Responsibility centers are often categorized by the degree of authority and responsibility given to the manager:

Cost centers. In a cost center the manager is responsible only for costs. Examples of cost centers include a production department, maintenance department, accounting department, human resource department, etc.
Profit centers. In a profit center the manager is responsible for its costs and revenues. For example, a company may have a consumer products division and an industrial division to more effectively market the company's products. Each division's manager is responsible for sales and expenses. However, if the company's executive team makes all of the investment decisions, the divisions are considered to be profit centers.
Investment centers. In an investment center the manager is responsible for investment decisions as well as costs and revenues. For instance, in a large corporation with many subsidiary companies, the corporation may give authority to the head of each subsidiary to make decisions on the needed investments. In that situation the manager is the head of an investment center.",what
What is the traditional method used in cost accounting?,"The traditional method of cost accounting refers to the allocation of manufacturing overhead costs to the products manufactured. The traditional method (also known as the conventional method) assigns or allocates the factory's indirect costs to the items manufactured on the basis of volume such as the number of units produced, the direct labor hours, or the production machine hours. We will use machine hours in our discussion.
By using only machine hours to allocate the manufacturing overhead to products, it is implying that the machine hours are the underlying cause of the factory overhead. Traditionally, that may have been reasonable or at least sufficient for the company's external financial statements. However, in recent decades the manufacturing overhead has been driven or caused by many other factors. For example, some customers are likely to demand additional manufacturing operations for their diverse products. Other customers simply want great quantities of uniform products.
If a manufacturer wants to know the true cost to produce specific products for specific customers, the traditional method of cost accounting is inadequate. Activity based costing (ABC) was developed to overcome the shortcomings of the traditional method. Instead of just one cost driver such as machine hours, ABC will use many cost drivers to allocate a manufacturer's indirect costs. A few of the cost drivers that would be used under ABC include the number of machine setups, the pounds of material purchased or used, the number of engineering change orders, the number of machine hours, and so on.",what
What is variance analysis?,"Definition of Variance Analysis
In accounting, a variance is the difference between an actual amount and a budgeted, planned or past amount. Variance analysis is one step in the process of identifying and explaining the reasons for different outcomes.
Variance analysis is usually associated with a manufacturer's product costs. In this setting, variance analysis attempts to identify the causes of the differences between a manufacturer's 1) standard or planned costs of the inputs that should have occurred for the actual products manufactured, and 2) the actual costs of the inputs used for the actual products manufactured.
Example of Variance Analysis
Assume that a company manufactured 10,000 units of product (output). The company's standards indicate that it should have used $40,000 of materials (an input), but it actually used $48,000 of materials. The variance analysis may include the following:

There is an $8,000 unfavorable variance which needs to be analyzed
The $8,000 variance can be separated into a price variance and a quantity variance
The price variance identifies whether the actual cost per pound of the input was more or less than the planned or standard cost per pound
The quantity variance identifies whether the actual quantity of the input used was more or less than the planned or standard quantity for the actual output

The variance analysis of manufacturing overhead costs is more complicated than the variance analysis for materials. However, the variance analysis of manufacturing overhead costs is important since these costs have become a large percentage of manufacturing costs.",what
Are direct costs fixed and indirect costs variable?,"Direct Costs vs. Indirect Costs
The terms direct costs and indirect costs could be referring to a product, a department, a machine, geographic market, etc. (which are referred to as cost objects). 
If the cost object is a company's product that is being manufactured, the cost of the product's raw materials and the cost of the employees on the assembly line are direct costs since they are directly traceable to the product. However, the cost of the other employees in the manufacturing facility (maintenance, clean-up, material handlers, etc.) and the other costs of the manufacturing facility (depreciation, property tax, maintenance, heat, and insurance) are indirect product costs since these costs must be allocated to the product. These indirect product costs are also known as manufacturing overhead costs, factory overhead costs, and burden.
If the cost object is the company's production department, the depreciation of the production equipment and the salary of the manager of the production department are direct costs of the production department. However, the depreciation, heat, and maintenance, etc. of the building containing the production department (which also includes the warehouse for materials, the warehouse for finished goods, the shipping department, and quality control department) are indirect costs of the production department, since they must be allocated to the production department.
Fixed Costs vs. Variable Costs
If the cost object is a product being manufactured, it is likely that direct materials are a variable cost. (If one pound of material is used for each unit, then this direct cost is variable.) However, the product's indirect manufacturing costs are likely a combination of fixed costs and variable costs. For instance, if the managers within the manufacturing facility but not on the assembly line are paid salaries which total $20,000 per month, this cost is a fixed indirect product cost. The equipment maintenance expense and the temporary shipping clerks could be a variable indirect product cost, since this cost will vary with production volume.
If the cost object is the production department, the direct and indirect department costs are likely to be partly fixed and partly variable. For example, the production department has it own electric meter to measure the electricity used to operate its equipment. Therefore, the electricity cost is a direct production department cost that is variable since it changes with the volume of products manufactured. On the other hand the salaries of the production department supervisors are a direct production department cost that is fixed.",what
What is the high-low method?,"The high-low method is a simple technique for computing the variable cost rate and the total amount of fixed costs that are part of mixed costs. Mixed costs are costs that are partially variable and partially fixed. The cost of electricity used in a factory is likely to be a mixed cost since some of the electricity will vary with the number of machine hours, while some of the cost will not vary with machine hours. Perhaps this second part of the electricity cost is associated with circulating and chilling the air in the factory and from the public utility billing its large customers with a significant fixed monthly charge not directly tied to the kilowatt hours of electricity used.
The high-low method uses two sets of numbers: 1) the total dollars of the mixed costs occurring at the highest volume of activity, and 2) the total dollars of the mixed costs occurring at the lowest volume of activity. It is assumed that at both points of activity the total amount of fixed costs is the same. Therefore, the change in the total costs is assumed to be the variable cost rate times the change in the number of units of activity. Prior to using the high-low method, it is important to plot or graph all of the data available to be certain that the two sets of numbers being used are indeed representative.
To illustrate the high-low method, let's assume that a company had total costs of electricity of $18,000 in the month when its highest activity was 120,000 machine hours. (Be sure to match the dates of the machine hours to the electric meter reading dates.) During the month of its lowest activity there were 100,000 machine hours and the total cost of electricity was $16,000. This means that the total monthly cost of electricity changed by $2,000 when the number of machine hours changed by 20,000. This indicates that the variable cost rate was $0.10 per machine hour.
Continuing with this example, if the total electricity cost was $18,000 when there were 120,000 machine hours, the variable portion is assumed to have been $12,000 (120,000 machine hours times $0.10). Since the total electricity cost was $18,000 and the variable cost was calculated to be $12,000, the fixed cost of electricity for the month must have been the $6,000. If we use the lowest level of activity, the total cost of $16,000 would include $10,000 of variable cost (100,000 machine hours times $0.10) with the remainder of $6,000 being the fixed cost for the month.",what
What is the difference between normal costing and standard costing?,"Definition of Normal Costing
Normal costing for manufactured products consists of following:

Actual cost of materials
Actual cost of direct labor
Applied manufacturing overhead cost based on a predetermined manufacturing overhead rate

The three product costs are used for calculating the cost of goods sold and the cost of the various inventories.
If there is a difference between the total amount of overhead costs applied to the products and the total amount of actual overhead costs incurred, the difference is referred to as a variance. If the amount of the variance is not significant, it will usually be assigned to the cost of goods sold. If the variance is significant, it should be prorated to the cost of goods sold, the work-in-process inventory, and the finished goods inventory based on their amounts of applied overhead.
Definition of Standard Costing
Standard costing for manufactured products consists of the following:

Predetermined materials costs
Predetermined direct labor costs
Predetermined manufacturing overhead costs

These standard costs are used to calculate the manufacturer's cost of goods sold and inventories.
If the actual costs vary only slightly from the standard costs, the resulting variances will be assigned to the cost of goods sold. If the variances are significant, they should be prorated to the cost of goods sold and to various inventories based on their amounts of the standard costs.",what
What are fixed assets?,"Definition of Fixed Assets
Fixed assets are a company's tangible, noncurrent assets that are used in its business operations. The word fixed  indicates that these assets will not be used up, consumed, or sold in the current accounting year.
A company's fixed assets are reported in the noncurrent (or long-term) asset section of the balance sheet in the section described as property, plant and equipment. The fixed assets except for land will be depreciated and their accumulated depreciation will also be reported under property, plant and equipment.
Examples of Fixed Assets
Some of a manufacturer's fixed assets include:

Land, land improvements, buildings
Machinery and equipment
Trucks, automobiles
Furniture and fixtures
Computer systems",what
What is a cost driver?,"Ideally, a cost driver is an activity that is the root cause of why a cost occurs.
In the past century, the root cause of indirect manufacturing costs has changed from a single cost driver (such as direct labor hours) to several cost drivers. Due to sophisticated manufacturing and increased demands from customers, direct labor is no longer the main cost driver of indirect manufacturing overhead.
In addition to direct labor, today's drivers of indirect manufacturing costs include the number of machine setups required, the number of engineering change orders, the demands from customers for special inspections, handling and storage, the number of components in the units produced, and the number of production machine hours.
Manufacturers that want to know the true costs of their products need to know what is driving their indirect manufacturing costs. For these companies it is not sufficient to merely spread overhead costs to products by using a single factor such as direct labor hours or production machine hours.",what
What is insurance expense?,"Definition of Insurance Expense
Under the accrual basis of accounting, insurance expense is the cost of insurance that has been incurred, has expired, or has been used up during the current accounting period for the nonmanufacturing functions of a business.
A manufacturer will report on its income statement the insurance expense incurred for its selling, general and administrative functions. However, the insurance costs associated with the manufacturing function are included in the cost of the current period's output. Any prepaid insurance costs are to be reported as a current asset.
Example of Insurance Expense
Let's assume that a retailer has insurance policies for its property, general liability, vehicles, and employees' worker compensation, medical, dental, life, and disability. The company pays the premiums on the various insurance policies in advance. Any insurance premium costs that have not expired as of the balance sheet date should be reported as a current asset such as Prepaid Insurance. The costs that have expired should be reported in income statement accounts such as Insurance Expense, Fringe Benefits Expense, etc. Here's a recap for the cost of insurance at the retailer:

Expired insurance premiums are reported as Insurance Expense.
Unexpired insurance premiums are reported as Prepaid Insurance (an asset account).

If the retailer has incurred some insurance expense but has not yet paid the premiums, the retailer should debit Insurance Expense and credit Insurance Premiums Payable.",what
What are inventoriable costs?,"Inventoriable costs are 1) the costs to purchase or manufacture products which will be resold, plus 2) the costs to get those products in place and ready for sale. Inventoriable costs are also known as product costs.
To illustrate, let's assume that a retailer purchases an item for resale by paying $20 to the supplier. The item is purchased FOB shipping point, which means that the retailer must pay the freight from the supplier to its location. If that freight cost is $1, then the retailer's inventoriable cost is $21. Assuming this is the only item in the retailer's inventory, the retailer's balance sheet will report inventory at a cost of $21. When the item is sold, the retailer's inventory will decrease by $21 and the $21 will be reported on the income statement as the cost of goods sold.
In the case of a manufacturer, a product's inventoriable costs are the costs of the direct materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead incurred in manufacturing the product.",what
What is managerial accounting?,"Definition of Managerial Accounting
Managerial accounting is also known as management accounting and it includes many of the topics that are included in cost accounting.
Some of the managerial topics involve the computation of a manufacturer's product costs that are needed for the external financial statements which must comply with US GAAP. Other topics involve analyses and reports that are not distributed outside of the company but are used by management in its decision making and in the planning and control of the business operations.
Examples of Managerial Accounting Topics
Managerial accounting topics often include:

Job order costing
Process costing
Absorption costing vs. variable costing
Understanding cost behavior and cost-volume-profit analysis
Operational budgeting
Standard costing and variance analysis
Activity based costing
Pricing of individual products and services
Analyzing the profitability of product lines, customers, territories, etc.
Capital budgeting
Ratio analysis",what
What are indirect manufacturing costs?,"Definition of Indirect Manufacturing Costs
Indirect manufacturing costs are a manufacturer's production costs other than direct materials and direct labor. Indirect manufacturing costs are also referred to as manufacturing overhead, factory overhead, factory burden, or burden.
US GAAP requires that indirect manufacturing costs be allocated to, assigned to, or absorbed by the manufacturer's output (in addition to the cost of direct materials and direct labor) for its external financial statements. This is known as absorption costing and must be used in determining a manufacturer's cost of goods sold and the cost of its inventory.
In traditional cost accounting, the indirect manufacturing costs are allocated to the products manufactured based on direct labor hours, direct labor costs, or production machine hours. However, in recent decades the indirect manufacturing costs have increased significantly and are less likely to be caused by the quantity of direct labor or production machine hours. (This may not be a problem for financial reporting when the amount of inventory is consistently small, but it can be a problem for pricing and other decisions.)
Examples of Indirect Manufacturing Costs
Some examples of indirect manufacturing costs include:

depreciation, repairs and maintenance, electricity, etc. for the production facilities and the production equipment
salaries, wages and fringe benefits of the indirect manufacturing personnel such as production supervisors, material handlers, quality assurance, and other factory support personnel
factory supplies, outside services pertaining to manufacturing, and other manufacturing related costs",what
What is direct labor?,"Definition of Direct Labor
Direct labor refers to the employees and temporary staff who work directly on a manufacturer's products. (People working in the production area, but not directly on the products, are referred to as indirect labor.)
The direct labor cost includes the wages and fringe benefits of the direct labor employees and the cost of the temporary staff that are working directly on the manufacturer's products.
The direct labor cost is classified as the following:

A product cost (along with the costs of the direct materials and manufacturing overhead)
An inventoriable cost (along with the costs of the direct materials and manufacturing overhead)
A prime cost (along with direct materials)
A conversion cost (along with manufacturing overhead)",what
What is relevant range?,"Definition of Relevant Range
In accounting, the term relevant range usually refers to a normal range of volume or normal amount of activity in which the total amount of a company's fixed costs will not change as the volume or amount of activity changes. The term relevant range is included in the definition of fixed costs, because if a company's volume were to decline to an extremely low level, the company would take action to decrease its total amount of fixed costs. Similarly, if the company's volume were to increase dramatically, the company would likely have to increase the total amount of its fixed costs . 
Example of Relevant Range
Let's assume that a manufacturer's monthly production volume is consistently between 10,000 to 13,000 units of product requiring between 20,000 to 25,000 machine hours. Within these ranges of activity, the manufacturing operations run smoothly with the same amount of monthly fixed costs, which on average are approximately $200,000 per month for the cost of supervisors, rent, depreciation, and other fixed costs.
However, if the manufacturer's volume were to drop to say 7,000 units of product and/or to 14,000 machine hours, it would likely reduce the number of its supervisors, the space it rents, and some other fixed costs in order to reduce the $200,000 of monthly fixed costs. If the company's volume were to increase to 18,000 units of product and/or 30,000 machine hours, the company would likely have to increase its total fixed costs to pay for additional supervisors, space, and other fixed costs. Hence, an experienced accountant would say that the company's fixed costs are approximately $200,000 per month within a relevant range of activity.",what
What is a plant-wide overhead rate?,"A plant-wide overhead rate is a single rate used to assign or allocate all of a company's manufacturing overhead costs to its production output. (Manufacturing overhead costs are the indirect costs of production such as repairs, maintenance, depreciation, electricity, supervision, etc.) Often the plant-wide rate is an amount per machine hour, an amount per labor hour, or a percentage of a product's direct costs.
Using a plant-wide rate is logical when there is one root cause of the indirect production costs and the company manufactures similar products. For example, a company with a simple manufacturing operation that produces similar products could have a plant-wide overhead rate of $40 per machine hour if it has budgeted $800,000 of total manufacturing overhead costs and it expects to produce 20,000 machine hours of good output.
On the other hand, if the company manufactures diverse products, some of which use expensive equipment while some use only inexpensive equipment, a plant-wide rate is not appropriate. In response to this situation, manufacturers have developed departmental overhead rates. Thus, only the products that use the expensive equipment in a specific department will be assigned a higher overhead rate of perhaps $70 per departmental machine hour. The products requiring a simpler operation such as assembling may be assigned overhead at a rate of perhaps $20 per direct labor hour.
Some companies have moved beyond both the plant-wide rate and the departmental rates because they want to consider all of the activities that are driving up manufacturing overhead costs. These companies are attempting to find the root causes of the indirect manufacturing costs so they can assign the costs to products in a more logical manner (instead of merely spreading the costs arbitrarily via plant-wide or departmental production hours). This effort is known as activity based costing.",what
What is elastic demand?,"Definition of Elastic Demand
Elastic demand is the situation in which demand for a product or service is sensitive to price changes. 
Elastic demand is a major concern for a manufacturer that attempts to set a product's price based on the product's costs. For instance, if the manufacturer's production and sales have declined and it fails to cut fixed costs, the manufacturer could be worse off by increasing selling prices. It could even lead to a death spiral.
Examples of Elastic Demand
If the selling price of a product is increased, the number of units sold will decrease. If the selling price of a product is decreased, the number of units sold will increase. Elastic demand is also referred to as the price elasticity of demand.
[Inelastic demand means that the demand for a product is not sensitive to price changes.]",what
How do you calculate opportunity costs?,"First, you will not find opportunity costs in the general ledger. The reason is that opportunity costs are the profits associated with a missed or lost opportunity. For example, if a company has a limited number of machine hours available on its large specialized machine and the setup time is four hours, the company is losing the opportunity of producing profits during those four hours.
Opportunity costs are often thought of as the lost contribution margin, which is revenues minus variable costs. If the large specialized machine is billed out to customers at $200 per hour and the variable costs of operating the machine are $80 per hour, the contribution margin and the opportunity cost is $120 per machine hour. During the four-hour setup time, the company is losing or foregoing the contribution margin of $480. In other words, its opportunity cost for the setup time is $480.
While this opportunity cost of $480 per setup cannot be recorded in the general ledger accounts, it should be considered in quoting or setting prices for customers. It should also motivate the company to look for ways to reduce the time needed to set up the machine.",what
What is inventory valuation?,"In the U.S. inventory valuation is the dollar amount associated with the items contained in a company's inventory. Initially the amount is the cost of the items defined as all of the costs necessary to get the inventory items in place and ready for sale. (The costs of selling and administration are not included in the cost of inventory.)
Since the inventory items are constantly being sold and restocked and since the costs of the items are constantly changing, a company must select a cost flow assumption. Cost flow assumptions include first-in, first-out; weighted average; and last-in, first out. The company is expected to be consistent in its application of the selected cost flow assumption.
A manufacturer's inventory valuation will include the costs of production, namely direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead. Manufacturers are also required to consistently follow their cost flow assumptions.
Inventory valuation is important in that it affects the cost of goods sold, a significant amount reported on the company's income statement. Inventory is also an important component of a company's current assets, working capital, and current ratio.
If the net realizable value of a company's inventory declines to a value which is less than its cost, the company is usually required to report the inventory at its net realizable value. (Net realizable value is the expected selling price minus the the costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.)",what
What are production costs?,"Definition of Production Costs
In managerial accounting and cost accounting, production costs are the costs that occur in the manufacturing facilities.
Production costs are also referred to as manufacturing costs, product costs, and a manufacturer's inventoriable costs.
Examples of Production Costs
A manufacturer's production costs consists of the costs for the following:

Direct materials
Direct labor
Manufacturing overhead",what
What is the difference between a budget and a standard?,"A budget usually refers to a department's or a company's projected revenues, costs, or expenses. A standard usually refers to a projected amount per unit of product, per unit of input (such as direct materials, factory overhead), or per unit of output.
For example, a manufacturer will have budgets for its manufacturing or factory overhead departments. Let's assume that the budgeted manufacturing overhead for the upcoming year is expected to be $1,000,000 in order to produce the expected 100,000 identical units of product. The standard cost of manufacturing overhead per unit of product is $10 ($1,000,000 divided by 100,000 units). When the products are not identical, the $1,000,000 of manufacturing overhead might be divided by the expected number of machine hours required to manufacture the units of product. Assuming it will take 50,000 machine hours, the standard cost of the manufacturing overhead will be $20 per machine hour ($1,000,000 divided by 50,000 machine hours).",what
What is setup cost?,"Definition of Setup Cost
In manufacturing, setup cost is the cost incurred to get equipment ready to process a different batch of goods. Hence, setup cost is regarded as a batch-level cost in activity based costing.
Setup cost is considered to be a non-value-added cost that should be minimized.
Examples of Setup Costs
Setup costs include the following:

Costs of changing the tools or dies on the equipment
Preparing and moving materials or components to the equipment
Testing the initial output to be certain it meets the specifications

In addition to the out-of-pocket costs, such as the labor cost of setting up the equipment, there is also an opportunity cost. The opportunity cost of setting up the equipment is the lost opportunity to manufacture profitable output during the time that the equipment is being set up.",what
Is depreciation a direct or indirect cost?,"Depreciation can be either a direct cost or an indirect cost, or it can be both direct and indirect.
Let's illustrate this with the depreciation of a machine used in Department 23 of a manufacturer. The depreciation on that machine is a direct cost for Department 23. It is direct because it is traceable to Department 23 without any allocation.
The depreciation of this same machine will be an indirect cost of the products manufactured with that machine. It is indirect because the depreciation is allocated to the products. Perhaps the machine in Department 23 has depreciation of $50,000 per year (cost of machine of $500,000 divided by 10 years of useful life). The $50,000 of annual depreciation is then assigned or allocated to products based on the number of hours that products use the machine. For example, if the manufacture expects 20,000 machine hours of use in the current year, then it assigns or allocates $2.50 ($50,000/20,000) per machine hour to each product using the machine. If Product #189 requires one hour of this machine's time, Product #189 will have $2.50 as part of its indirect costs. Indirect manufacturing costs are also referred to as manufacturing overhead, factory overhead, or burden.",what
Why use normal costing instead of actual costing?,"Normal costing uses a predetermined annual overhead rate to assign manufacturing overhead to products. In other words, the overhead rate under normal costing is based on the expected overhead costs for the entire accounting year and the expected production volume for the entire year.
Under actual costing each month's actual costs and each month's actual production volume are used to assign overhead costs. Since most companies will experience month to month fluctuations in activity, the actual monthly overhead rates will likely vary from month to month.
Normal costing will result in an overhead rate that is more uniform and realistic for all of the units manufactured during an accounting year.",what
What are out-of-pocket costs?,"Out-of-pocket costs are those costs or expenses that require a cash payment in the current period or during a project.
For example, the wages of the person setting up a machine for a new production run are an out-of-pocket cost. However, the cost of the lost opportunity to be producing profitable output during the setup time is not an out-of-pocket cost. (The cost of not earning profits during the setup time, known as an opportunity cost, is often far greater than the out-of-pocket costs.)
Another example of out-of-pocket costs are the current year's repairs and maintenance expenses on a church that was constructed 15 years ago. However, the current depreciation expense on the church is not an out-of-pocket cost. The current period's depreciation is also referred to as a noncash expense.",what
Is rent expense a period cost or a product cost?,"When a company incurs rent for its manufacturing operations, the rent is a product cost. It is common for the rent to be included in the manufacturing overhead that will be allocated or assigned to the products. That rent as part of the manufacturing overhead cost will cling to the products. If the products remain in inventory, the rent is included in the manufacturing overhead portion of the product's cost. When products are sold, the rent allocated to those products will be expensed as part of the cost of goods sold.
If the rent is for items involved in the selling function (rent for office space, equipment, autos, etc.) or if the rent is for items in the administrative function of the company, the rent is a period cost and will be expensed in the period when the expense is incurred. These rents will not be allocated to the products for external financial statements.",what
How do I compute the product cost per unit?,"In accounting, we define the product cost as the direct material, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead. Costs such as advertising, preparing invoices, delivery expense, office salaries, office rent and utilities, and interest on loans are examples of expenses that are not considered to be product costs. Rather, these costs are expensed immediately to the period instead of being assigned to a product.
To be profitable, a company must have its selling prices large enough to cover both the product costs of the units sold and the period expenses.
The product cost is used for valuing the inventory and for determining the cost of goods sold. Since some of the manufacturing overhead costs are fixed in total (factory rent, factory depreciation, factory managers' salaries), the per unit cost of a product will depend upon the number of units manufactured during a given year. In other words, the cost of a product is not know with precision, even though accountants will compute the per unit cost to the nearest penny.",what
Why is the distinction between product costs and period costs important?,"The distinction between product costs and period costs is important to:

Properly measure a company's net income during the time specified on its income statement, and
To report the proper cost of inventory on the balance sheet

Definition of Product Costs
Product costs include the costs to manufacture products or to purchase products. If a product is unsold, the product costs will be reported as inventory on the balance sheet. When the product is sold, its cost is removed from inventory and will be included on the income statement as the cost of goods sold. Product costs are also referred to as inventoriable costs.
Examples of Product Costs
The product costs for a retailer will be the amount paid to the supplier plus any freight-in. Product costs for a manufacturer will be the direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead used to manufacture a product.
Definition of Period Costs
Period costs are expenses that will be reported on the income statement without ever attaching to products. Since they are not product costs, period costs will not be included in the cost of inventory. Instead, period costs will be referred to as period expenses since they will be reported on the income statement as selling, general and administrative (SG&A) or interest expenses.
Example of Period Costs
Selling expenses (such as commissions, salaries of sales employees, advertising), general and administrative (general office salaries, rent, utilities, etc.), and interest expense will be reported on the income statement when they are directly related to sales or when they are used up. For example, the insurance premiums that a company pays for nonmanufacturing protection will be expensed in the period in which the insurance premiums expire. (However, the insurance premiums for the manufacturing operations will become part of the product costs as the insurance premiums expire.)",what
What is a fixed cost?,"A fixed cost is one that does not change in total within a reasonable range of activity. For example, the rent for a production facility is a fixed cost if the rent will not change when there are reasonable changes in the amount of output or input. (Of course, if there is a need to double the output the rent will change when the company occupies additional work space.)
While a fixed cost remains constant in total, the fixed cost per unit of output or input will change inversely with the change in the quantity of output or input. For instance, if the rent of the production facility is fixed at $120,000 per year and there are 30,000 machine hours of good output during the year, the rent will be $4 ($120,000/30,000) per machine hour. If there are 40,000 machine hours during the year, the rent will be $3 ($120,000/40,000) per machine hour.
Many manufacturing overhead costs are fixed and the amounts occur in large increments. Some examples include depreciation on a company-owned factory, depreciation on machinery and equipment, salaries and benefits of manufacturing supervisors, factory administration costs, etc. One challenge for accountants is the allocation or assigning of the large fixed costs to the individual units of product (which likely vary in size and complexity). This allocation (or assigning or absorbing) is required by the accounting and income tax rules for valuing inventories and the cost of goods sold. If the fixed overhead is assigned using machine hours, one must keep in mind that the cost rate per machine hour is not how the fixed costs behave or occur. In our example, the cost of the rent might be assigned to the products at the rate of $3 or $4 per machine hour but the rent actually occurs at the rate of $10,000 per month.",what
Is the rental cost of a building considered overhead?,"The rental cost of a building used in manufacturing is part of manufacturing overhead. Manufacturing overhead is an indirect product cost. Indirect product costs are allocated or assigned to products on some reasonable basis. As a result, the rental cost of a manufacturing building will cling to the products manufactured. If the goods manufactured are in inventory, some of the rent of the manufacturing facility is in inventory. When a product is sold, the manufacturing rent that is included in the product cost will be part of the cost of goods sold.
The rental cost of a building that is not used for manufacturing (e.g. rent for a sales office, rent for the general administrative office) is not part of the manufacturing overhead. This rent does not cling to the products and will not be part of the cost of an item in inventory. The rent for nonmanufacturing facilities is immediately expensed in the accounting period when the building is rented.
If a rented building is used for both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing activities, the rent should be allocated to each (perhaps on the basis of square footage).",what
What is the meaning of fixed overhead absorbed?,"This phrase is used in cost accounting and involves the assigning, applying, or allocating of fixed manufacturing overhead costs to the units produced by a manufacturer.
Three examples of fixed manufacturing overhead costs include 1) depreciation of the manufacturing equipment, 2) the property tax on the factory building, and 3) the salaries of the factory supervisors. Each of these costs comes in large dollar amounts (they do not occur at a rate of say $1.00 per unit) and none is directly traceable to the products manufactured. The dollar amount of each of these costs will probably not change if the company produces 10% more units or 10% fewer units.
Because the fixed manufacturing overhead costs are indirect product costs (not directly traceable to the products) the accountant allocates (or assigns or applies) these costs to the products on some basis—perhaps on the basis of machine hours or through activity-based costing. While the accountant assigns or allocates these costs, the products are said to be absorbing these fixed manufacturing costs. (Absorption costing, which is required for external financial statements, means that each product's cost includes direct materials, direct labor, variable manufacturing overhead, and fixed manufacturing overhead.)
Fixed manufacturing overhead cost is usually applied to the products (and is absorbed by the products) through the use of a predetermined annual overhead rate that is based on some planned volume of production. If the actual product volume is less than the planned volume (and the costs are as planned) the fixed manufacturing overhead will be underabsorbed. When the actual volume exceeds the planned volume and the costs are as planned, the fixed manufacturing overhead will be overabsorbed.",what
"Under accrual accounting, how are worker comp premiums handled?","Worker comp insurance premiums should be charged to the areas where the related wages and salaries are charged.
Let's assume that the net cost of worker comp insurance after discounts and dividends is 5% of the wages and salaries of direct and indirect manufacturing employees. If for the month of January the direct labor is $40,000, then $2,000 of the worker comp cost should be included as direct labor. If indirect labor for January is $60,000 then $3,000 of worker comp cost should be included as the cost of the indirect labor.
If the general office worker comp rates are 0.2% of the general office wages and salaries, then 0.2% of January's general office wages and salaries will be expensed as worker comp insurance expense.
If the employer remits each month's worker comp cost to its insurance company each accounting period, there will be no prepaid insurance nor will there be a liability for accrued worker comp expense.
If the employer remits worker comp premiums to the insurance company in advance of the cost associated with wages and salaries, the amount that is prepaid as of the balance sheet date should be reported as Prepaid Insurance, a current asset. If the employer has remitted less than the worker comp cost associated with the wages and salaries, the amount owed to the insurance company as of the balance sheet date is reported as a current liability such as Accrued Worker Comp Payable.",what
Can absorption costing cause an increase in net income?,"Absorption costing could result in an increase in net income if a company increases its production and its inventory. This occurs because fixed manufacturing overhead is allocated to more production units—some of which will be reported as inventory.
To illustrate, let's assume that a company has no beginning inventory and it has production plans for 100,000 units. Let's also assume that its annual fixed manufacturing overhead is $600,000. If 100,000 units are produced, the fixed manufacturing cost per unit will be $6 ($600,000 divided by 100,000 units). If the 100,000 units are sold for $20 each, the income statement will report sales revenues of $2,000,000 and its cost of goods sold will include $600,000 of fixed manufacturing overhead.
Now let's assume that the company decides to produce 120,000 units even though sales are expected to remain at 100,000 units. Because the fixed manufacturing overhead remains at $600,000 the cost per unit for fixed manufacturing overhead will be $5 ($600,000 divided by 120,000 units produced). In this case the company will report the same sales revenues of $2,000,000 (100,000 units sold times $20) but its cost of goods sold will include only $500,000 of fixed manufacturing overhead (100,000 units sold times $5). The company's balance sheet account Inventory will include $100,000 (20,000 units times $5) of the company's fixed manufacturing overhead.
As was illustrated above, the income statement will report a lower cost of goods sold when production and inventory increased. A smaller cost of goods sold will mean more gross profit and more net income.
Standard Costing: Fixed Manufacturing Overhead Variances
Income Statement: Manufacturer - Corporation, Multiple-Step",what
What is the major weakness of the traditional method of allocating factory overhead?,"Under the traditional method of allocating factory overhead (manufacturing overhead, burden), most of the factory overhead costs are allocated on the basis of just one factor such as machine hours or direct labor hours. In other words, the traditional method implies there is only one driver of the factory overhead and the driver is machine hours (or direct labor hours, or some other indicator of volume produced).
In reality there are many drivers of the factory overhead: machine setups, unique inspections, special handling, special storage, and so on. The more diversity in products and/or in customer demands, the bigger the problem of allocating all the costs of these various activities via only one activity such as the production machine's hours.
Under the traditional method, the costs of performing all of the diverse activities will be contained in one cost pool and will be divided by the number of production machine hours. This results is one average rate that is applied to all products regardless of the number of activities and the complexity of those activities. Since the cost of many of the diverse activities do not correlate at all with the number of production machine hours, the resulting allocations are misleading.
Activity-based costing is intended to overcome the weakness of the traditional method by having various pools of costs and then allocating each pool's costs on the basis of its root cause.",what
What are semivariable costs?,"Semivariable costs are costs or expenses whose behavior is partially fixed and partially variable. Semivariable costs are also referred to as mixed costs.
A common example of a semivariable cost is the annual cost of operating a vehicle. Some of the vehicle's operating costs will vary with the number of miles driven while other costs will be the same in total regardless of the miles driven. For example, the vehicle's fuel costs will be variable. However, the depreciation, insurance and licensing may be fixed. Looking only at the vehicle's maintenance costs may indicate that some maintenance is done each November (regardless of the number of miles driven) while other maintenance is done every 6,000 miles.
A manufacturer's electricity cost is another example of a semivariable cost. Part of the monthly electricity bill will include 1) a fixed amount, and 2) a separate amount based on the number of kilowatt hours of electricity actually used by the company.
The manufacturer's electricity cost is also a semivariable cost in relationship with the company's machine hours. The portion of the electricity cost used to operate the production equipment is variable, but the portion of the electricity cost used for lighting and air conditioning the manufacturing facility is a fixed cost.
These simple examples illustrate that it can be difficult to understand how costs behave. There are many factors, activities, and drivers that influence the level of costs.",what
What is a service department?,"A service department is usually associated with a manufacturer. A service department is part of the factory operations, but does not produce the factory's output. Rather, it provides services to the factory's production departments. Some examples of service departments include the factory maintenance department, quality control, factory information technology departments, and the purchasing department.
The head of each service department is held responsible for the costs incurred in his or her service department. In traditional cost accounting each service department's costs are then allocated to the production departments. The service departments' costs become a production department's indirect factory overhead which is then allocated to the output of each production department.
The various methods of allocating service departments' costs are covered in cost accounting textbooks.",what
What is the death spiral?,"In cost accounting and managerial accounting, the term death spiral refers to the repeated elimination of products resulting from spreading costs on the basis of volume instead of their root causes. The death spiral is also known as the downward demand spiral.
To illustrate the death spiral let's assume that Product X is a simple, high-volume product that requires little manufacturing attention. If the accountant spreads the company's manufacturing overhead costs based on volume, Product X will appear to have high overhead costs. (In reality, Product X causes very little overhead cost especially when compared to the company's many complex, low-volume products.) If management responds to Product X's allocated high overhead costs and 1) seeks a price increase which causes the customer to move the production to a competitor with a lower price, 2) outsources the production, or 3) drops the product, then the company's manufacturing volume will decrease.
If the company does not reduce its fixed overhead to correspond to the decreased manufacturing volume and the accountant continues to spread the overhead costs—including the cost of excess capacity—on the basis of volume, the remaining products will have to be assigned more of the overhead costs. If management again reacts to the new, higher, allocated costs by seeking price increases which cause a loss of sales, outsources production, or drops the products, the company's manufacturing volume will again decrease. If fixed costs are not decreased accordingly and the accountant again spreads the overhead on the basis of a new, even smaller volume, the entire company could die from the high fixed costs and a small volume of products being produced and sold.
To avoid the death spiral, some companies attempt to allocate overhead costs based on activities and product complexities rather than simply spreading them on volume. Also, some companies do not allocate the costs of excess capacity to products in order to minimize the death spiral.",what
What are departmental overhead rates?,"Departmental overhead rates are used by many manufacturers instead of using a single, plant-wide overhead rate. The reason for departmental overhead rates is that a manufacturer is likely to produce many diverse products which use different processes (each of which has different costs).
To illustrate, let's assume that a manufacturer has three operations with each occurring in a separate department:

Dept #1 uses a large, sophisticated machine having a cost of $900,000
Dept #2 uses a small $40,000 machine to refine the products coming out of Dept #1
Dept #3 is an additional, optional process that uses a $10,000 machine

When the manufacturer divided its total manufacturing overhead for the upcoming year by the total machine hours for the upcoming year, the result was a plant-wide overhead rate of $30. If Product A requires 7 hours in Dept #1 and 1 hour in Dept #2, it will be assigned overhead of $240 [(7+1)X$30]. If Product B requires 2 hours in Dept #1, 2 hours in Dept #2, and 4 hours in Dept #3, it will also be assigned overhead of $240 [(2+2+4)X$30].
When departmental overhead rates were computed, the manufacturing overhead rate for Dept #1 was $50 per machine hour (resulting from high amounts of depreciation, electricity, maintenance, etc.). The overhead rate per machine hour for Dept #2 was $20, and $15 for Dept #3. Using the more accurate departmental overhead rates Product A will be assigned overhead of $370 [(7X$50)+(1X$20)]. Product B will be assigned overhead of $200 [(2X$50)+(2X$20)+(4X$15)].
Having multiple, departmental overhead rates will better reflect the costs of manufacturing Product A and Product B compared to using a single, plant-wide overhead rate.",what
Is the depreciation of delivery trucks a period cost or is it manufacturing overhead?,"The depreciation on the trucks used to deliver products to customers is a period cost. The depreciation on delivery trucks will be reported as an expense on the income statement in the period in which it occurs. It might be reported as part of Selling Expenses or as part of Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses.
The depreciation on the trucks used to transport materials or work-in-process between the facilities of a manufacturer is a component of manufacturing overhead. In other words, the depreciation on trucks used in the manufacturing process is assigned to the goods produced rather than being expensed directly.",what
Why is manufacturing overhead allocated to products?,"Manufacturing overhead, which is also known as factory overhead, burden, and indirect manufacturing costs, needs to be allocated to products for the following reasons:

Some of the goods manufactured are not sold in the same period in which they were produced.
The goods not sold must be reported at their cost in the company's asset entitled Inventory.
Accounting principles require that each product's inventory cost include both direct and indirect manufacturing costs.
Indirect costs by definition mean they are not directly traceable to a product and will require an allocation.
Some companies set their products' selling prices based on their costs. In the long run, the products' selling prices must be large enough to cover all of a company's manufacturing costs (including the indirect manufacturing costs) plus the company's selling, general and administrative expenses and a profit for the company's owners.

If a company never has inventory (because each period it sells all of its production) the allocation of manufacturing overhead could be avoided. The reason is that all of the manufacturing costs will be reported as the cost of goods sold. However, the company may still choose to allocate the manufacturing overhead for internal pricing decisions or to comply with a government contract.",what
Are repairs to office equipment and factory equipment period costs?,"Repairs to office equipment are period costs. That is, the cost of the repairs to office equipment will be reported as a selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense in the period in which the repairs take place.
Repairs to factory equipment are not period costs. Rather, the costs of repairs to factory equipment are product costs. The repair costs within the factory are part of the factory overhead (also known as manufacturing overhead) which is assigned to the products when they are manufactured. When those products are sold, the costs of the products (raw materials, direct labor, and factory overhead) will be expensed as the cost of goods sold. Until the products are sold, the products' costs will be reported as the current asset Inventory.",what
What is an indirect cost?,"An indirect cost is a cost that is not directly traceable to a cost object. Rather, the cost is common to several objects and requires an allocation.
For example, the depreciation of the factory building is an indirect cost of manufacturing products. The reason is that the annual cost of the factory building is not directly traceable to a specific unit of product manufactured during the year. The depreciation will be included in manufacturing overhead which is allocated to the units of  product manufactured during the year.",what
What do overabsorbed and underabsorbed mean?,"In cost accounting, manufacturing overhead costs are often assigned to products by using a predetermined overhead rate. The predetermined rate is likely based on an annual manufacturing overhead budget divided by some activity such as the expected number of machine hours. Instead of saying that the manufacturing overhead is assigned, we might say it is allocated, applied or apportioned to the products manufactured during the period. We could also say that the products have absorbed the overhead.
If the amount of overhead assigned to the products manufactured is greater than the amount of overhead actually incurred, the products have overabsorbed the overhead costs. If the amount of overhead assigned to the products is less than the amount of overhead actually incurred, the products have underabsorbed the overhead costs.
The cause of the overabsorption or underabsorption will be some combination of 1) the quantity of products manufactured, and 2) the actual overhead costs incurred.",what
Is depreciation an operating expense?,"Depreciation Could Be Either an Operating Expense or a Non-operating Expense
Depreciation is an operating expense if the asset being depreciated is used in an organization's main operating activities.
Depreciation is a non-operating expense if the asset being depreciated is used in a peripheral or incidental activity of an organization.
Examples of When Depreciation is an Operating Expense
Examples of depreciation being reported as part of the operating expenses on the income statement include:

Depreciation of a retailer's store displays, warehouse equipment, delivery truck, and buildings used in its selling and general administrative functions. The depreciation will be reported on the retailer's income statement in the section containing its SG&A expenses.
Depreciation of the equipment and building used in the manufacturer's selling and general administrative functions. This depreciation will be reported on the manufacturer's income statement in the section containing its SG&A expenses.
Depreciation of equipment and building used in the manufacturing of products. This depreciation will be allocated to the goods produced and is considered part of a product's indirect costs. In the period in which a product is sold, its cost (including its share of depreciation) will be reported as part of the cost of goods sold, which is likely to be the largest operating expense on a manufacturer's income statement.",what
Are insurance premiums a fixed cost?,"The cost of the insurance premiums for a company's property insurance is likely to be a fixed cost. The cost of worker compensation insurance is likely to be a variable cost. Whether a cost is a fixed cost, a variable cost, or a mixed cost depends on the independent variable.
Let's illustrate this by looking at the cost of property insurance. The cost of insuring the factory building is a fixed cost when the independent variable is the number of units produced within the factory. In other words, the factory's property insurance might be $6,000 per year whether its output is 2 million units, 3 million units, or 5 million units. On the other hand, if the independent variable is the replacement cost of the factory buildings, the insurance cost will be a variable cost. The reason is the insurance cost on $12 million of factory buildings will be more than the insurance cost on $9 million of factory buildings, and less than the insurance premiums on $18 million of factory buildings.
In the case of worker compensation insurance, the cost will vary with the amount of payroll dollars (excluding overtime premium) in each class of workers. For example, if the worker comp premiums are $5 per $100 of factory labor cost, then the worker comp premiums will be variable with respect to the dollars of factory labor cost. If the units of output in the factory correlate with the direct labor costs, then the worker compensation cost will also be variable with respect to the number of units produced. On the other hand, the worker compensation cost for the office staff is usually a much smaller rate and that worker compensation cost will not be variable with respect to the number of units of output in the factory. However, the worker compensation cost of the office staff will be variable with respect to the amount of office staff salaries and wages.
As you have seen, determining which costs are fixed and which are variable can be a bit tricky.",what
What is meant by the full cost of a product?,"Many (perhaps most) accountants use the term full cost to mean the full manufacturing or production cost of a product. To these accountants this means a product's cost of materials, labor, and both variable and fixed manufacturing overhead. These accountants do not include selling, administrative, or interest costs in their definition of the full cost of a product. Their view is consistent with the way that inventory and the cost of goods sold are reported on a company's financial statements.
Some accountants use the term full cost to mean more than a product's manufacturing or production costs (including fixed manufacturing overhead). These accountants use full cost to mean the manufacturing cost plus an allocated portion of the company's selling, administrative, and interest costs. These accountants are concerned that some products require a larger portion of selling and administrative costs while other products require a small portion. Only when a product's selling and administrative costs are combined with the product's manufacturing costs will they be able to determine whether each product's selling price is sufficient or is aligned with its ""full cost"".
It is important to realize that the term full cost can have different meanings to different business professionals.",what
What is theoretical capacity?,"Theoretical capacity is the level of a manufacturer's production that would be attained if all of its equipment and operations performed continuously at their optimum efficiency. Theoretical capacity is also referred to as ideal capacity.
As the names imply, the theoretical capacity or ideal capacity is not realistic due to repairs, maintenance, setups, and other factors that will result in down time.",what
What causes an unfavorable fixed overhead budget variance?,"An unfavorable fixed overhead budget variance results when the actual amount spent on fixed manufacturing overhead costs exceeds the budgeted amount. The fixed overhead budget variance is also known as the fixed overhead spending variance.
Fixed overhead costs are the indirect manufacturing costs that are not expected to change when the volume of activity changes. Some examples of fixed manufacturing overhead include the depreciation, property tax and insurance of the factory buildings and equipment, and the salaries of the manufacturing supervisors and managers.
Since the fixed manufacturing overhead costs should remain the same within reasonable ranges of activity, the amount of the fixed overhead budget variance should be relatively small.",what
What does an unfavorable volume variance indicate?,"An unfavorable volume variance indicates that the amount of fixed manufacturing overhead costs applied (or assigned) to the manufacturer's output was less than the budgeted or planned amount of fixed manufacturing overhead costs for the same time period. The unfavorable volume variance indicates that the period's output was less than the planned output.
The volume variance is also referred to as the production volume variance, the capacity variance, or the idle capacity variance.
In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued its Statement No. 151, which discusses the reporting of the fixed production overhead when less than normal capacity is utilized. The FASB's Statements of Financial Accounting Standards are available at no cost at www.FASB.org/st.",what
Is a favorable variance always an indicator of efficiency in operation?,"In a standard costing system, some favorable variances are not indicators of efficiency in operations. For example, the materials price variance, the labor rate variance, the manufacturing overhead spending and budget variances, and the production volume variance are generally not related to the efficiency of the operations.
On the other hand, the materials usage variance, the labor efficiency variance, and the variable manufacturing efficiency variance are indicators of operating efficiency. However, it is possible that some of these variances could result from standards that were not realistic. For example, if it realistically takes 2.4 hours to produce a unit of output, but the standard is set for 2.5 hours, there should be a favorable variance of 0.1 hour. This 0.1 hour variance results from the unrealistic standard, rather than operational efficiency.",what
Why would the cost behavior change outside of the relevant range of activity?,"Cost behavior often changes outside of the relevant range of activity due to a change in the fixed costs. When volume increases to a certain point, more fixed costs will have to be added. When volume shrinks significantly, some fixed costs could be eliminated.
Here's an illustration. A company manufactures products in its 100,000 square foot plant. The company's depreciation on the plant is $1,000,000 per year. The capacity of the plant is 500,000 units of output and its normal output is 400,000 units per year. When the company is manufacturing between 300,000 and 500,000 units, it needs salaried managers earning $400,000 per year. Below 300,000 units of output, some of the salaried manager positions would be eliminated. Above 500,000 units, the company will need to add plant space and managers.
For this example, the relevant range is between 300,000 units and 500,000 units of output per year. In that range the total of the two fixed costs is $1,400,000 per year. Below 300,000 units, the fixed costs will drop to less than $1,400,000 because some salaries will be eliminated and some of the space might be rented. When the volume exceeds 500,000 units per year, the company will need to add fixed costs because of the additional space and the additional managers. Perhaps the total fixed costs will be $2,000,000 for output between 500,000 units and 700,000 units.",what
What is a product cost?,"Definition of a Retailer's Product Cost
In accounting, a retailer’s product cost is the cost paid to a supplier plus any other costs that are necessary to get the product in place and ready for sale. For example, if a retailer pays $40 to its supplier and then pays $10 to get it delivered to its warehouse, the retailer’s product cost is $50. 
Definition of a Manufacturer's Product Cost
A manufacturer’s product cost includes the cost of each product’s raw materials plus the costs of converting the raw materials into products. The manufacturer's product costs are usually classified into three groups:

Raw materials used in the product
Direct labor used to make the product
Manufacturing overhead incurred to make the product

Since the manufacturing overhead costs are indirect costs, they must be allocated to the products manufactured to comply with financial accounting standards and U.S. income tax regulations. The details for allocating or assigning the manufacturing costs to the products manufactured are contained in the college course known as cost accounting or managerial accounting.
Product Costs Are Used for Inventory and Cost of Goods Sold
Both the product costs of a retailer and the product costs of a manufacturer are also referred to as inventoriable costs, since the product costs are used to value their goods in inventory. When the goods are sold, the product costs will be removed from inventory and will appear on the income statement as the cost of goods sold.
SG&A Not Included in Product Costs
The selling, general, administrative (SG&A) and interest costs of a retailer and/or a manufacturer are not product costs. Rather, they are reported as expenses on the income statement of the accounting period in which they were incurred.",what
Can a cost be both a direct cost and an indirect cost?,"A cost can be both a direct cost and an indirect cost. One of many examples is the cost of a supervisor in a department within a factory.
Let's assume that Sam earns $50,000 per year as the supervisor of the machining department of a factory. Sam's $50,000 is a direct cost of the machining department because Sam works only in the machining department. Hence, this $50,000 is directly traceable to the machining department.
Sam's $50,000 is also an indirect product cost. It is an indirect cost because the supervisor of the machining department is part of the factory overhead costs that must be assigned to the products. (Instead of being assigned we could say that manufacturing overhead must be allocated or applied to products by using an overhead rate.) We might also say that Sam's $50,000 is part of the factory overhead costs that must be absorbed by the products by means of a factory overhead rate.",what
What is a predetermined overhead rate?,"A predetermined overhead rate is often an annual rate for assigning or allocating indirect manufacturing costs to the goods it produces. Manufacturing overhead is allocated to products for various reasons including compliance with U.S. accounting principles and income tax regulations. 
A predetermined annual overhead rate is likely computed shortly before the start of the accounting year in which it will be used. The computation of the rate is 1) the budgeted amount of manufacturing overhead for the upcoming year divided by 2) the budgeted or normal number of machine hours (or some other activity) for the upcoming year. Using annual amounts (and the resulting annual rate) eliminates the monthly and seasonal fluctuations which may occur. 
A manufacturer producing only a few similar products might use a plant-wide overhead rate. However, if the products require different processes, it is better for each process to have its own specific overhead rate. These multiple overhead rates are also known as departmental overhead rates.",what
What is a burden rate in inventory?,"I assume that the burden rate in inventory refers to a manufacturer's indirect manufacturing costs, which are also referred to as factory overhead, indirect production costs, and burden. In the U.S., a manufactured product's cost consists of direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead. Since manufacturing overhead is an indirect cost, it is usually assigned or allocated through an overhead rate or burden rate. Two examples of an overhead or burden rate are 1) a percentage of direct labor, and 2) an hourly cost rate assigned on the basis of machine hours.
A product's manufacturing cost, consisting of direct materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead, is used to report the cost of goods sold and also the cost of units in inventory. Therefore, if you look at the detail of a product's inventory cost, you may see the manufacturing overhead being assigned or applied to the unit through a burden rate.",what
Isn't all overhead fixed?,"Not all overhead is fixed. Some manufacturing overhead costs, which are also referred to as indirect factory costs, are variable.
A common example of a variable overhead cost is the electricity used to operate factory equipment. The electricity is an indirect manufacturing cost (since it is not part of the direct materials or direct labor) and the total cost of the electricity used in the factory will increase when the equipment is used to create more products. There will also be less total electricity cost when the equipment produces fewer units of output.",what
What is the coefficient of determination?,"The coefficient of determination is a statistic which indicates the percentage change in the amount of the dependent variable that is ""explained by"" the changes in the independent variables.
For example, a manufacturer may have found through simple linear regression analysis involving 15 monthly observations that 64% of the change in the total cost of electricity (the dependent variable) was associated with the change in the monthly production machine hours (the independent variable). In this example the coefficient of determination is 0.64 or 64%.
The coefficient of determination is symbolized by r-squared, where r is the coefficient of correlation. Hence, a coefficient of determination of 0.64 or 64% means that the coefficient of correlation was 0.8 or 80%. (The range for the coefficient of correlation is -1 to +1, and therefore the range for the coefficient of determination is 0 to +1.)
It is important to note that a high coefficient of determination does not guarantee that a cause-and-effect relationship exists. However, a cause-and-effect relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable will result in a high coefficient of determination.",what
How do you determine the fixed portion of overhead cost?,"I suggest that the first step in determining the fixed portion of a mixed cost (a cost that is partially fixed and partially variable) is to graph the data. Label the vertical or y-axis of the graph as Total Manufacturing Overhead (or Total Electricity Cost if you are analyzing the individual components of overhead). Label the horizontal or x-axis of the graph as total machine hours (or some other indicator of volume). Then put a point on the graph for each of the past 12 months. If January had $100,000 of overhead and 6,000 MHs, enter a point on the graph where those two amounts intersect. After plotting all 12 months, you might see a pattern and/or you might see something unusual. Investigate the unusual before proceeding. Perhaps there was an accounting error or a very unusual situation that is not likely to recur. Once you are confident that the data is reasonable you can proceed. (Please note that the overhead costs need to be on an accrual basis. In other words, you need to have the costs that occurred when the machine hours occurred. Your data will be misleading if you relate this month's machine hours to the electricity bill that was paid this month, if that bill is for the previous month's electricity usage. Check the meter reading dates on the bill to be sure the dates of the electricity usage agree with the dates of the machine hours.)
Once you eliminated any ""outliers"" from the graph (or scattergraph) and you are confident that the dollar amounts are related to the activity on the x-axis, you can proceed. One technique is the High-Low method. This method uses only two of the points or months on your graph: the point where the MHs were the highest and the point where the MHs were the lowest...so long as those two points are not outliers. Let's assume that the highest number of MHs occurred in September. At that point the MHs were 10,000 and the total overhead cost was $140,000. Let's assume that the lowest activity occurred in January when the MHs were 6,000 and the total overhead cost was $100,000. If the range of these MHs (6,000 to 10,000) are not outside the range of normal activity, we know by definition that the fixed manufacturing costs will not change in this range as the MHs change. That means that any change in the total manufacturing costs in this range must be the change in the variable costs. Here's the formula: Variable Cost Rate = Change in total costs divided by the change in the MHs. In our example, Variable Cost Rate = $40,000 ($140,000 minus $100,000) divided by 4,000 MHs (10,000 MHs minus 6,000 MHs) equals $10 per MH. The total variable costs at the lowest activity = 6,000 MH times $10 variable rate = $60,000. Since the total overhead costs were $100,000 the fixed costs must have been $40,000. At the highest level of activity, the total variable costs = 10,000 MHs X $10 = $100,000. Since the total costs at this level were $140,000 the fixed costs must be $40,000. So we estimate (based on just two points) that the manufacturing overhead is $40,000 per month + $10 per MH.
A more sophisticated method for separating the fixed costs from the mixed costs would be to use all of the points (rather than only the highest and lowest). The technique to accomplish this is regression analysis. The use of regression analysis not only gives you the best equation for all the points, it also generates statistics on how much of the change in manufacturing overhead is caused by the MHs. Undoubtedly you will find that MHs are causing only part of the change in the overhead costs. This feedback is important if it prompts you to identify the other variables that are causing the manufacturing overhead costs to change.
In summary, the High-Low method is an overly simplistic tool. Be careful and spend time understanding the relationships between activities and costs. Manufacturing processes and costs are probably driven by many activities (not just MHs) and not all products may require the same activities.",what
Is a utility bill an expense?,"The utility bill for a retailer or for a service company is an expense. Under the accrual basis of accounting, the utility bill is an expense for the period indicated by the meter reading dates.
A manufacturer's utility bill is more complicated. The utility bill for its selling and general administration will be an expense for the period indicated by the meter reading dates. However, the utility bill for the direct and indirect manufacturing operations is part of its manufacturing overhead. As such, the utility bill will be assigned or allocated to the units produced. In other words, the utility bill will be clinging to the units produced. Some of the utility cost will be clinging to the units in inventory and therefore will be part of the cost of the asset inventory. Some of the utility cost will be clinging to the units that have been sold and will be part of the expense known as the cost of goods sold.",what
How can a manufacturer determine the precise cost of its products?,"A manufacturer may never be able to determine the precise cost of its individual products. The reason is that most of the manufacturing costs (other than materials and some labor) are indirect costs. This means that most of the manufacturing costs are not directly traceable to individual products and will need to be allocated to them. Examples of indirect manufacturing costs include the rent, property taxes, depreciation, heat, lighting, indirect production workers pay and benefits, repairs, maintenance, and others that occur in the factory.
In addition to the manufacturing costs, there are selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses and perhaps interest expense. Generally, accountants do not consider these expenses to be product costs. As a result these expenses are reported on the income statement when they occur and without any allocation to the products. However, these expenses are associated with some or all of the products.
The manufacturer can attempt to calculate the costs and expenses of each of its products, but I don't think the result will be the true, precise cost. In addition to the allocations (which are viewed as arbitrary), consider that changes in volume will affect a product's cost. For example, if a company's total fixed costs remain constant but its volume of products decreases by 20%, the cost of each product will increase. If volume increases, the cost of each product will decrease.
Activity-based costing (ABC) is an attempt to improve the allocation of costs by identifying more of the root causes of the costs (rather than merely spreading costs to products based on machine hours). Even with ABC there will be arbitrary allocations which will prevent knowing each product's precise cost.",what
What are the advantages of departmentalizing manufacturing overhead costs?,"The departmentalizing of manufacturing overhead costs allows for better planning and control if the head of each department is held responsible for the costs and productivity of his or her department.
The departmentalizing of manufacturing overhead costs also allows for the computation and application of several departmental overhead cost rates instead of having a single, plant-wide overhead rate. This is important when there are a variety of products and some require many operations in a department with high overhead rates, while other products require very few operations in the high cost department. There may also be products which require many hours of processing, but they occur in low cost departments.  For instance, the assembly and packing departments of a manufacturer are likely to have very low overhead cost rates. On the other hand, the fabricating and milling departments will likely have much higher overhead cost rates.",what
What is the weakness of traditional cost allocations?,"Traditional cost allocations are often based on volume such as number of products manufactured, number of direct labor hours, number of production machine hours, number of square feet, etc. Unfortunately, it is becoming more frequent that the common costs or indirect costs that require allocation are not caused by volume. In other words, traditional cost allocations are often based on something other than the root causes of the costs.
It is possible that a significant amount of manufacturing overhead might not be caused by production machine hours, yet the overhead is allocated using those hours. For example, a few of a manufacturer's low volume products may require significant amounts of engineering changes, additional inspections, frequent machine setups with unusually short production runs, special handling, additional storage, and so on. To allocate these special costs to all products on the basis of the number of production machine hours (instead of allocating those costs based on their root causes) will result in individual product costs that are inaccurate and misleading.",what
What is a dependent variable?,"In accounting, a dependent variable is likely to be the total of a mixed cost that will change as the result of several factors. A factor that causes the change in the total cost is referred to as the independent variable.
To illustrate, assume that a manufacturer wants to estimate its total electricity cost for each month. The total electricity cost will be the dependent variable. Since the manufacturer's machines use large amounts of electricity, the total cost of electricity is dependent on the number of machine hours. In this example, the machine hours will be an independent variable. (It is likely that there will be many independent variables that cause the change in the amount of the dependent variable.)
The dependent variable is usually expressed as y or y' (the estimated amount of y) and the amount is referenced on a graph's y-axis. (An independent variable is expressed as x and is referenced on a graph's x-axis.) Hence the equation for the monthly electricity cost will be y = a + bx, which signifies that the total electricity cost (y) for a specific month is equal to a fixed cost (a) plus a variable cost rate (b) multiplied times the number of machine hours (x) occurring during the month.",what
What is an independent variable?,"In accounting, an independent variable is ideally a factor that causes a change in the total amount of the dependent variable. In other words, an independent variable should be something that drives a mixed cost to increase or decrease.
To illustrate, let's assume that a manufacturer's production equipment uses a significant amount of electricity. Hence, the monthly electricity cost (the dependent variable) will increase when there is an increase in the number of production machine hours (the independent variable).
In reality there are likely to be many independent variables that cause a change in the amount of the dependent variable. In the case of the monthly electricity cost, the independent variables could also include the non-production machines using electricity, the physical size of the products, the skill level of the operators, the outside temperature and humidity, etc.
Multiple regression analysis is a statistical tool that can assist in determining the significant independent variables.",what
What is meant by overabsorbed?,"Overabsorbed is usually used in the context of a manufacturer's production overhead costs. Since manufacturing overhead costs are not directly traceable to products, they need to be allocated, assigned, or applied to the products through an overhead rate. We also state that the products absorb the overhead costs through the overhead rate.
The overhead rate is normally a predetermined rate—meaning that it was calculated prior to the start of the accounting year by using 1) the expected amount of overhead costs, and 2) the expected volume of production. Because of these two estimates, it is unlikely that the amount of overhead allocated, applied, assigned, or absorbed will be equal to the actual overhead costs incurred.
If the actual products manufactured are assigned or absorb more overhead through the overhead rate than the actual amount of overhead costs incurred, the products have overabsorbed the overhead costs.
At the end of the accounting year, the amount of the overapplied, overassigned, or overabsorbed overhead is often credited to the cost of goods sold. The reasons are 1) the overabsorbed amount is not significant, and 2) most of the products absorbing too much overhead costs have been sold. If the overabsorbed amount is significant, then the amount overabsorbed must be prorated or allocated as a reduction to the cost of the inventories and to the cost of goods sold based on where the overabsorbed overhead costs are residing at the end of the accounting year.",what
Should a manufacturer's selling prices be based on costs?,"A manufacturer's selling prices should not be based on costs alone. One reason is that the actual cost of each product is not known with precision. At best, each product's cost is an average that resulted from allocations of the indirect manufacturing costs. In addition, there are selling, general and administrative expenses that are even more difficult to associate with individual products.
A more compelling reason that selling prices should not be based solely on costs is the market for a product. If a product is unique, protected by a patent and trademark, and the demand for the product is high, customers may accept a selling price that is unusually high. In other words, the value of the product is much greater than the costs identified with the product plus a normal profit or markup.
At other times the market will include competitors offering a similar product at lower selling prices because of efficiencies, lower costs, or inaccurate cost calculations. Perhaps another competitor will sell a similar product at a lower selling price in hopes of attracting customers who will buy additional, more profitable products. These situations will likely prevent the manufacturer from achieving significant sales at selling prices that are based on costs plus a desired profit.
Given the complexity of a manufacturer's operations and the competition in the market place, it is rare for a manufacturer to have selling prices based on its true costs plus a uniform rate of profit.",what
What type of expense is the purchase of propane?,"Technically, the purchase of propane is not an expense. Depending on the business, the propane is an asset until it is used, resold, or included in a product that is sold. At that time it will become an expense.
If the purchased propane is used relatively soon, accountants will usually skip recording the asset. Here are three examples of how the expense might be reported on the company's income statement.
Example 1. A service company purchases $900 of propane to heat its office for the following month. Technically the propane is an asset until used. However, the accountant is likely to skip recording of the asset and will record the purchase as a $900 operating expense.
Example 2. A local dealer purchases large quantities of propane and then delivers the propane in small quantities to its customers. The dealer will record the purchase as the asset Propane Inventory. As the propane is sold, the dealer will reduce Propane Inventory for the cost of the propane sold and will increase the expense Cost of Goods Sold.
Example 3. A manufacturer uses propane in its factory operations. The cost of the propane purchased is likely to be recorded as Manufacturing Overhead. Manufacturing Overhead is allocated to the products manufactured and will be part of the products' cost. If the products are in Inventory, those products' costs are assets. If the products are sold, those products' costs will be expensed as Cost of Goods Sold.",what
Why does a cost system developed for inventory valuation distort product cost information?,"The cost system for inventory valuation may have been developed to provide a reasonable total cost of inventory and a reasonable total cost of goods sold in order to have reasonably accurate financial statements. If a company has small inventory amounts and significant sales, a simple cost system that spreads manufacturing overhead costs solely on the basis of machine hours can result in a reasonably accurate balance sheet and income statement.
While a simple cost system using just one cost driver (machine hours) may result in accurate financial statements, it often fails to provide the true cost of individual products that vary in complexity. For example, one product might require very few machine hours but will require many hours of special handling. The costs assigned on the basis of machine hours alone will be too low in relationship to the true cost of manufacturing this product. Another product might require many machine hours but no other activities. This product's cost will be overstated because the rate assigned via the machine hours will include an amount for other activities that generally occur for the other products manufactured.
A cost system developed for inventory valuation is limited to the cost of direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead. The total cost of providing products to a customer will also include nonmanufacturing expenses. One customer might require a company to incur additional selling, delivering, storing, and administrative expenses. Another customer might not require any of those activities and their related expenses.
Activity based costing attempts to calculate the true cost of a product and customer by assigning costs and expenses based on their root causes. Because there are many root causes, the company will assign costs based on many cost drivers. This results in more accuracy for the cost and expense of a specific product for a specific customer than simply spreading the manufacturing costs on the basis of one cost driver such as machine hours.",what
Are there two ABC methods in accounting?,"Some accountants use ABC to mean Activity Based Costing. Under this ABC a manufacturer will use many cost drivers to assign overhead costs to products. The objective of Activity Based Costing is to assign the overhead costs based on their root causes rather than merely spreading the costs on the basis of direct labor hours or production machine hours.
A second use of ABC involves categorizing inventory items into ""A"" items, ""B"" items, and ""C"" items. The ""A"" items are a relatively small number of items which account for the majority of the inventory's value. For example, the ""A"" items might be 20% of the items in inventory which account for 70% of the inventory value. At the other extreme the ""C"" items might be 60% of the items in inventory but they account for only 10% of the inventory value. The ""B"" items might be 20% of the items accounting for 20% of the inventory value. Under this system, the ""A"" items will receive the most attention since they account for 70% of the value. This ABC is sometimes referred to as Pareto analysis or Pareto's rule and it can be applied to more than inventory. For example, 20% of a company's customers might account for 70% of the company's sales.",what
What is the difference between product costs and period costs?,"A manufacturer's product costs are the direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead used in making its products. (Manufacturing overhead is also referred to as factory overhead, indirect manufacturing costs, and burden.) The product costs of direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead are also ""inventoriable"" costs, since these are the necessary costs of manufacturing the products.
Period costs are not a necessary part of the manufacturing process. As a result, period costs cannot be assigned to the products or to the cost of inventory. The period costs are usually associated with the selling function of the business or its general administration. The period costs are reported as expenses in the accounting period in which they 1) best match with revenues, 2) when they expire, or 3) in the current accounting period. In addition to the selling and general administrative expenses, most interest expense is a period expense.",what
What is the difference between a cost center and a profit center?,"Definition of Cost Center
A cost center is a subunit of a company that is responsible only for its costs. A few examples of cost centers are:

Production departments within a factory
Service departments within a factory
Administrative departments such as IT and accounting
Definition of a Profit Center
A profit center is a subunit of a company that is responsible for revenues and costs. If a division of a company has responsibility for revenues, costs, and the resulting profits, it is a profit center.
Additional Comments
Cost centers and profit centers are usually associated with planning and control in a decentralized company.",what
What is a cost center?,"Definition of Cost Center
A cost center is often a department within a company. The manager and employees of a cost center are responsible for its costs but are not directly responsible for revenues or investment decisions.
Examples of Cost Centers
A manufacturer's cost centers will often include:

Each of its production departments
Each of the service departments or support departments within a production facility, such as the maintenance department and quality control department
A company's general, selling and administrative (SG&A) departments such as the company's human resource department, sales and marketing departments, IT department, accounting department, etc.

It is also possible for a company to have several cost centers within one department. For example, each assembly line could be a separate cost center within one production department. Even a special machine could be a separate cost center.
Cost centers are usually associated with the topics of decentralization, responsibility accounting, and planning and control.",what
What is SG&A?,"Definition of SG&A
SG&A is the acronym for selling, general and administrative. SG&A are the operating expenses incurred to 1) promote, sell, and deliver a company's products and services, and 2) manage the overall company.
SG&A will be reported on the income statement in the period in which the expenses occur. Hence, SG&A expenses are said to be period costs as opposed to being part of a product's cost. Since SG&A expenses are not a product cost, they are not assigned to the cost of goods sold or to the goods that are in inventory. 
Examples of SG&A
SG&A expenses include sales commissions, advertising, promotional materials, compensation of the company's officers as well as the marketing, sales, finance and office staffs, rent, utilities, supplies, computers, etc. provided they are outside of the manufacturing operations.
SG&A will not include interest expense since interest expense is reported as a nonoperating expense.",what
Are salaries and wages part of expenses on the income statement?,"Definition of Salaries and Wages
Salaries and wages are forms of compensation paid to employees of a company.
Salaries and Wages as Expenses on Income Statement
Salaries and wages of a company's employees working in nonmanufacturing functions (e.g. selling, general administration, etc.) are part of the expenses reported on the company's income statement. Under the accrual method of accounting, the amounts are reported in the accounting period in which the employees earn the salaries and wages.
Salaries and Wages of Employees in Manufacturing
At a manufacturing company, the salaries and wages of employees in the manufacturing operations are assigned to the products manufactured. When the products are sold, the costs assigned to those products (including the manufacturing salaries and wages) are included in the cost of goods sold, which is reported on the income statement. (The costs of the products that are not sold are reported as inventory on the balance sheet. Hence, the inventory will contain some of the manufacturing salaries and wages.
The salaries and wages of people in the nonmanufacturing functions such as selling, general administrative, etc. are reported directly on the current income statement as expenses in the period in which they were earned by the employees.",what
What is cost allocation?,"Definition of Cost Allocation
Cost allocation is the assigning of a cost to several cost objects such as products or departments. The cost allocation is needed because the cost is not directly traceable to a specific object. Since the cost is not directly traceable, the resulting allocation is somewhat arbitrary. Because of the arbitrariness, some people describe cost allocation as the spreading of a cost.
Accountants have made efforts to improve the cost allocation techniques. Over time, manufacturers' overhead allocations have moved from a plant-wide rates to departmental rates. Some allocations that were allocated on the basis of direct labor hours are now based on machine hours. In order to improve those bases of allocations, some accountants are implementing activity based costing. The goal is to reduce the arbitrariness by identifying the various root causes of the overhead costs.
Examples of Cost Allocations
The following are only a few of the many cost allocations that occur in some companies or organizations:

The cost of a manufacturing building is allocated to each of the years that the building is expected to be used. Each year's depreciation is allocated to the departments that use the building. Each department's allocated cost is then allocated/assigned to the products that are processed in the department.
The electricity that is used in the production facility as measured by a single meter is allocated to the departments using the electricity. Each department's electricity is then allocated/assigned to the products processed in the department.
The cost of raw land that was purchased for $1 million is going to be developed into 80 residential lots of various sizes and 10 business lots of different sizes. The $1 million cost must be allocated to the resulting 90 lots in a meaningful way so that the developer can report the profit of selling two residential lots and the largest of the business lots. The basis for the allocation is likely to be the net realizable values of the lots.
The annual salary and benefits of an employee that spends time in three main functions of a nonprofit organization.",what
What is responsibility accounting?,"Definition of Responsibility Accounting
Responsibility accounting involves the internal accounting and budgeting for each responsibility center within a company. The objective of responsibility accounting is to assist in the planning and control of a company's responsibility centers.
Example of Responsibility Accounting
Typically each decentralized department and division within a company will receive a monthly report showing its budgeted and actual amounts for the most recent month as well as the year-to-date budgeted and actual amounts.",what
What are direct costs?,"Definition of Direct Costs
Direct costs are directly traceable to a cost object such as a product or a department. In other words, direct costs do not have to be allocated to a product, department, or other cost object. (A cost that must be allocated to a product, department, or other cost object is an indirect cost.)
Examples of Direct Costs
Assume that a company produces artisan furniture. The following are direct product costs and they are direct production department costs:

The cost of the wood
The cost of the craftsperson working on the furniture

The other costs of producing the furniture are indirect product costs, since they must be allocated to the furniture based on labor hours, machine hours, or some other activities. However, the indirect product costs could be direct production department costs.",what
What is a responsibility center?,"Definition of Responsibility Center
A responsibility center is a part or subunit of a company in which the manager has some degree of authority and responsibility. The company's detailed organization chart is a logical source for identifying responsibility centers. The most common responsibility centers are the numerous departments within a company.
Examples of Responsibility Centers
Responsibility centers are often categorized by the degree of authority and responsibility given to the manager:

Cost centers. In a cost center the manager is responsible only for costs. Examples of cost centers include a production department, maintenance department, accounting department, human resource department, etc.
Profit centers. In a profit center the manager is responsible for its costs and revenues. For example, a company may have a consumer products division and an industrial division to more effectively market the company's products. Each division's manager is responsible for sales and expenses. However, if the company's executive team makes all of the investment decisions, the divisions are considered to be profit centers.
Investment centers. In an investment center the manager is responsible for investment decisions as well as costs and revenues. For instance, in a large corporation with many subsidiary companies, the corporation may give authority to the head of each subsidiary to make decisions on the needed investments. In that situation the manager is the head of an investment center.",what
Are direct costs fixed and indirect costs variable?,"Direct Costs vs. Indirect Costs
The terms direct costs and indirect costs could be referring to a product, a department, a machine, geographic market, etc. (which are referred to as cost objects). 
If the cost object is a company's product that is being manufactured, the cost of the product's raw materials and the cost of the employees on the assembly line are direct costs since they are directly traceable to the product. However, the cost of the other employees in the manufacturing facility (maintenance, clean-up, material handlers, etc.) and the other costs of the manufacturing facility (depreciation, property tax, maintenance, heat, and insurance) are indirect product costs since these costs must be allocated to the product. These indirect product costs are also known as manufacturing overhead costs, factory overhead costs, and burden.
If the cost object is the company's production department, the depreciation of the production equipment and the salary of the manager of the production department are direct costs of the production department. However, the depreciation, heat, and maintenance, etc. of the building containing the production department (which also includes the warehouse for materials, the warehouse for finished goods, the shipping department, and quality control department) are indirect costs of the production department, since they must be allocated to the production department.
Fixed Costs vs. Variable Costs
If the cost object is a product being manufactured, it is likely that direct materials are a variable cost. (If one pound of material is used for each unit, then this direct cost is variable.) However, the product's indirect manufacturing costs are likely a combination of fixed costs and variable costs. For instance, if the managers within the manufacturing facility but not on the assembly line are paid salaries which total $20,000 per month, this cost is a fixed indirect product cost. The equipment maintenance expense and the temporary shipping clerks could be a variable indirect product cost, since this cost will vary with production volume.
If the cost object is the production department, the direct and indirect department costs are likely to be partly fixed and partly variable. For example, the production department has it own electric meter to measure the electricity used to operate its equipment. Therefore, the electricity cost is a direct production department cost that is variable since it changes with the volume of products manufactured. On the other hand the salaries of the production department supervisors are a direct production department cost that is fixed.",what
What is elastic demand?,"Definition of Elastic Demand
Elastic demand is the situation in which demand for a product or service is sensitive to price changes. 
Elastic demand is a major concern for a manufacturer that attempts to set a product's price based on the product's costs. For instance, if the manufacturer's production and sales have declined and it fails to cut fixed costs, the manufacturer could be worse off by increasing selling prices. It could even lead to a death spiral.
Examples of Elastic Demand
If the selling price of a product is increased, the number of units sold will decrease. If the selling price of a product is decreased, the number of units sold will increase. Elastic demand is also referred to as the price elasticity of demand.
[Inelastic demand means that the demand for a product is not sensitive to price changes.]",what
Is rent expense a period cost or a product cost?,"When a company incurs rent for its manufacturing operations, the rent is a product cost. It is common for the rent to be included in the manufacturing overhead that will be allocated or assigned to the products. That rent as part of the manufacturing overhead cost will cling to the products. If the products remain in inventory, the rent is included in the manufacturing overhead portion of the product's cost. When products are sold, the rent allocated to those products will be expensed as part of the cost of goods sold.
If the rent is for items involved in the selling function (rent for office space, equipment, autos, etc.) or if the rent is for items in the administrative function of the company, the rent is a period cost and will be expensed in the period when the expense is incurred. These rents will not be allocated to the products for external financial statements.",what
Why is the distinction between product costs and period costs important?,"The distinction between product costs and period costs is important to:

Properly measure a company's net income during the time specified on its income statement, and
To report the proper cost of inventory on the balance sheet

Definition of Product Costs
Product costs include the costs to manufacture products or to purchase products. If a product is unsold, the product costs will be reported as inventory on the balance sheet. When the product is sold, its cost is removed from inventory and will be included on the income statement as the cost of goods sold. Product costs are also referred to as inventoriable costs.
Examples of Product Costs
The product costs for a retailer will be the amount paid to the supplier plus any freight-in. Product costs for a manufacturer will be the direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead used to manufacture a product.
Definition of Period Costs
Period costs are expenses that will be reported on the income statement without ever attaching to products. Since they are not product costs, period costs will not be included in the cost of inventory. Instead, period costs will be referred to as period expenses since they will be reported on the income statement as selling, general and administrative (SG&A) or interest expenses.
Example of Period Costs
Selling expenses (such as commissions, salaries of sales employees, advertising), general and administrative (general office salaries, rent, utilities, etc.), and interest expense will be reported on the income statement when they are directly related to sales or when they are used up. For example, the insurance premiums that a company pays for nonmanufacturing protection will be expensed in the period in which the insurance premiums expire. (However, the insurance premiums for the manufacturing operations will become part of the product costs as the insurance premiums expire.)",what
Is the rental cost of a building considered overhead?,"The rental cost of a building used in manufacturing is part of manufacturing overhead. Manufacturing overhead is an indirect product cost. Indirect product costs are allocated or assigned to products on some reasonable basis. As a result, the rental cost of a manufacturing building will cling to the products manufactured. If the goods manufactured are in inventory, some of the rent of the manufacturing facility is in inventory. When a product is sold, the manufacturing rent that is included in the product cost will be part of the cost of goods sold.
The rental cost of a building that is not used for manufacturing (e.g. rent for a sales office, rent for the general administrative office) is not part of the manufacturing overhead. This rent does not cling to the products and will not be part of the cost of an item in inventory. The rent for nonmanufacturing facilities is immediately expensed in the accounting period when the building is rented.
If a rented building is used for both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing activities, the rent should be allocated to each (perhaps on the basis of square footage).",what
"Under accrual accounting, how are worker comp premiums handled?","Worker comp insurance premiums should be charged to the areas where the related wages and salaries are charged.
Let's assume that the net cost of worker comp insurance after discounts and dividends is 5% of the wages and salaries of direct and indirect manufacturing employees. If for the month of January the direct labor is $40,000, then $2,000 of the worker comp cost should be included as direct labor. If indirect labor for January is $60,000 then $3,000 of worker comp cost should be included as the cost of the indirect labor.
If the general office worker comp rates are 0.2% of the general office wages and salaries, then 0.2% of January's general office wages and salaries will be expensed as worker comp insurance expense.
If the employer remits each month's worker comp cost to its insurance company each accounting period, there will be no prepaid insurance nor will there be a liability for accrued worker comp expense.
If the employer remits worker comp premiums to the insurance company in advance of the cost associated with wages and salaries, the amount that is prepaid as of the balance sheet date should be reported as Prepaid Insurance, a current asset. If the employer has remitted less than the worker comp cost associated with the wages and salaries, the amount owed to the insurance company as of the balance sheet date is reported as a current liability such as Accrued Worker Comp Payable.",what
What are nonmanufacturing overhead costs?,"Nonmanufacturing overhead costs are the business expenses that are outside of a company's manufacturing operations. These are often referred to as the selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses plus the company's interest expense. Examples of the nonmanufacturing overhead costs include the salaries and other expenses for the following business activities: selling, distribution, marketing, finance, IT, human resources, legal, and so on. (We have additional examples within our AccountingCoach.com topic Nonmanufacturing Overhead.)
Since these costs are outside of the manufacturing function, they are not considered to be costs of the products. As a result, the nonmanufacturing costs are not allocated to the products for determining the costs for inventory or for the cost of goods sold. Instead, the nonmanufacturing costs are immediately expensed in the accounting period in which they are incurred. That is why accountants say that the nonmanufacturing costs are period costs or period expenses. (Only the manufacturing costs of direct materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead are product costs.)
While the nonmanufacturing overhead costs are not allocated to the products, the company must have its selling prices and sales revenues sufficient to cover both the product costs and the period expenses in order to avoid a negative net income.",what
Are insurance premiums a fixed cost?,"The cost of the insurance premiums for a company's property insurance is likely to be a fixed cost. The cost of worker compensation insurance is likely to be a variable cost. Whether a cost is a fixed cost, a variable cost, or a mixed cost depends on the independent variable.
Let's illustrate this by looking at the cost of property insurance. The cost of insuring the factory building is a fixed cost when the independent variable is the number of units produced within the factory. In other words, the factory's property insurance might be $6,000 per year whether its output is 2 million units, 3 million units, or 5 million units. On the other hand, if the independent variable is the replacement cost of the factory buildings, the insurance cost will be a variable cost. The reason is the insurance cost on $12 million of factory buildings will be more than the insurance cost on $9 million of factory buildings, and less than the insurance premiums on $18 million of factory buildings.
In the case of worker compensation insurance, the cost will vary with the amount of payroll dollars (excluding overtime premium) in each class of workers. For example, if the worker comp premiums are $5 per $100 of factory labor cost, then the worker comp premiums will be variable with respect to the dollars of factory labor cost. If the units of output in the factory correlate with the direct labor costs, then the worker compensation cost will also be variable with respect to the number of units produced. On the other hand, the worker compensation cost for the office staff is usually a much smaller rate and that worker compensation cost will not be variable with respect to the number of units of output in the factory. However, the worker compensation cost of the office staff will be variable with respect to the amount of office staff salaries and wages.
As you have seen, determining which costs are fixed and which are variable can be a bit tricky.",what
What is meant by the full cost of a product?,"Many (perhaps most) accountants use the term full cost to mean the full manufacturing or production cost of a product. To these accountants this means a product's cost of materials, labor, and both variable and fixed manufacturing overhead. These accountants do not include selling, administrative, or interest costs in their definition of the full cost of a product. Their view is consistent with the way that inventory and the cost of goods sold are reported on a company's financial statements.
Some accountants use the term full cost to mean more than a product's manufacturing or production costs (including fixed manufacturing overhead). These accountants use full cost to mean the manufacturing cost plus an allocated portion of the company's selling, administrative, and interest costs. These accountants are concerned that some products require a larger portion of selling and administrative costs while other products require a small portion. Only when a product's selling and administrative costs are combined with the product's manufacturing costs will they be able to determine whether each product's selling price is sufficient or is aligned with its ""full cost"".
It is important to realize that the term full cost can have different meanings to different business professionals.",what
How can a manufacturer determine the precise cost of its products?,"A manufacturer may never be able to determine the precise cost of its individual products. The reason is that most of the manufacturing costs (other than materials and some labor) are indirect costs. This means that most of the manufacturing costs are not directly traceable to individual products and will need to be allocated to them. Examples of indirect manufacturing costs include the rent, property taxes, depreciation, heat, lighting, indirect production workers pay and benefits, repairs, maintenance, and others that occur in the factory.
In addition to the manufacturing costs, there are selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses and perhaps interest expense. Generally, accountants do not consider these expenses to be product costs. As a result these expenses are reported on the income statement when they occur and without any allocation to the products. However, these expenses are associated with some or all of the products.
The manufacturer can attempt to calculate the costs and expenses of each of its products, but I don't think the result will be the true, precise cost. In addition to the allocations (which are viewed as arbitrary), consider that changes in volume will affect a product's cost. For example, if a company's total fixed costs remain constant but its volume of products decreases by 20%, the cost of each product will increase. If volume increases, the cost of each product will decrease.
Activity-based costing (ABC) is an attempt to improve the allocation of costs by identifying more of the root causes of the costs (rather than merely spreading costs to products based on machine hours). Even with ABC there will be arbitrary allocations which will prevent knowing each product's precise cost.",what
"In least squares regression, what do y and a represent?","Here are the meanings of the components or symbols used in the least squares equation of y = a + bx:
y is the dependent variable, such as the estimated or expected total cost of electricity during a month. The amount of y is dependent upon the amounts of a and bx.
a is the estimated total amount of fixed electricity costs during the month. It is the value of y, when x is zero. If the total cost line intersects the y-axis at $1,000 then it is assumed that the total fixed costs for a month are $1,000.
b is the estimated variable cost per unit of x. It determines the slope of the total cost line. If b is $5, this means that the variable cost portion of electricity is estimated to be $5 for every unit of x.
x is the independent variable. For example, x could represent the known number of machine hours used in the month.
bx is the total variable cost of electricity. If the company's electricity cost is estimated to be $5 per unit of x, and x is 4,000 machine hours, then the total variable cost of electricity for the month is estimated to be $20,000.
In our example the total estimated cost of electricity (y) in a month when x is 4,000 machine hours will be $21,000.",what
Should a manufacturer's selling prices be based on costs?,"A manufacturer's selling prices should not be based on costs alone. One reason is that the actual cost of each product is not known with precision. At best, each product's cost is an average that resulted from allocations of the indirect manufacturing costs. In addition, there are selling, general and administrative expenses that are even more difficult to associate with individual products.
A more compelling reason that selling prices should not be based solely on costs is the market for a product. If a product is unique, protected by a patent and trademark, and the demand for the product is high, customers may accept a selling price that is unusually high. In other words, the value of the product is much greater than the costs identified with the product plus a normal profit or markup.
At other times the market will include competitors offering a similar product at lower selling prices because of efficiencies, lower costs, or inaccurate cost calculations. Perhaps another competitor will sell a similar product at a lower selling price in hopes of attracting customers who will buy additional, more profitable products. These situations will likely prevent the manufacturer from achieving significant sales at selling prices that are based on costs plus a desired profit.
Given the complexity of a manufacturer's operations and the competition in the market place, it is rare for a manufacturer to have selling prices based on its true costs plus a uniform rate of profit.",what
Why does a cost system developed for inventory valuation distort product cost information?,"The cost system for inventory valuation may have been developed to provide a reasonable total cost of inventory and a reasonable total cost of goods sold in order to have reasonably accurate financial statements. If a company has small inventory amounts and significant sales, a simple cost system that spreads manufacturing overhead costs solely on the basis of machine hours can result in a reasonably accurate balance sheet and income statement.
While a simple cost system using just one cost driver (machine hours) may result in accurate financial statements, it often fails to provide the true cost of individual products that vary in complexity. For example, one product might require very few machine hours but will require many hours of special handling. The costs assigned on the basis of machine hours alone will be too low in relationship to the true cost of manufacturing this product. Another product might require many machine hours but no other activities. This product's cost will be overstated because the rate assigned via the machine hours will include an amount for other activities that generally occur for the other products manufactured.
A cost system developed for inventory valuation is limited to the cost of direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead. The total cost of providing products to a customer will also include nonmanufacturing expenses. One customer might require a company to incur additional selling, delivering, storing, and administrative expenses. Another customer might not require any of those activities and their related expenses.
Activity based costing attempts to calculate the true cost of a product and customer by assigning costs and expenses based on their root causes. Because there are many root causes, the company will assign costs based on many cost drivers. This results in more accuracy for the cost and expense of a specific product for a specific customer than simply spreading the manufacturing costs on the basis of one cost driver such as machine hours.",what
What are net assets?,"Definition of Net Assets
Net assets is defined as total assets  minus total liabilities.
Examples of Net Assets
In a sole proprietorship the amount of net assets is reported as owner's equity.
In a corporation the amount of net assets is reported as stockholders' equity.
In a not-for-profit (NFP) organization, the net amount of its total assets minus total liabilities is actually reported as net assets in its statement of financial position.
The net assets section for the NFP organization is divided into two major classifications:

net assets without donor restrictions
net assets with donor restrictions",what
What is the statement of financial position?,"Definition of Statement of Financial Position
The statement of financial position is another name for the balance sheet. It is one of the main financial statements.
The statement of financial position reports an entity's assets, liabilities, and the difference in their totals as of the final moment of an accounting period.
The structure of the statement of financial position is similar to the basic accounting equation. For a corporation the format will be: Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders' Equity. A nonprofit organization's format will be: Assets = Liabilities + Net Assets.
The statement of financial position must reflect the basic accounting principles and guidelines such as the cost, matching, and full disclosure principle to name a few. Accordingly, the statement of financial position is more meaningful when it is prepared under the accrual method of accounting.",what
What is the difference between a balance sheet of a nonprofit organization and a for-profit business?,"A main difference is the section that presents the difference between the total assets and total liabilities. The nonprofit's statement of financial position refers to this section as net assets, whereas the for-profit business will refer to this section as owner's equity or stockholders' equity. The reason is the nonprofit does not have owners. This means that the nonprofit organization's statement of financial position will reflect this equation: assets – liabilities = net assets.
The net assets section will consist of the following parts: net assets without donor restrictions and net assets with donor restrictions. The amounts reported in each of these parts are obviously based on the donor's stipulations.",what
What is the statement of activities?,"The statement of activities is one of the main financial statements of a nonprofit or not-for-profit organization.
A nonprofit's statement of activities is issued instead of the income statement which is issued by a for-profit business.
The statement of activities focuses on the total organization (as opposed to focusing on funds within the organization) and reports the following:

Revenues such as contributions, program fees, membership dues, grants, investment income, and amounts released from restrictions.
Expenses reported in categories such as major programs, fundraising, and management and general.
The change in net assets resulting from items 1 and 2.

The statement of activities will have multiple columns in order to report the amounts for each of the following classes of net assets: without donor restrictions, with donor restrictions, and total.",what
What does it mean to report expenses by function?,"To report expenses by function means to report them according to the activity for which the expenses were incurred.
For a business, the reporting of expenses by function means the income statement will report expenses according to the following functional classifications: manufacturing, selling, general administrative, and financing.
For a not-for-profit organization, the reporting of expenses by function means the statement of activities will report expenses according to the following functional classifications: 1) each of its major programs, and 2) the supporting services which are a) management and general, b) fund-raising, and c) membership development. It will also present the expenses by nature, such as salaries, electricity, repairs, etc.
(Classifying expenses according to salaries, electricity, repairs, etc. is referred to as natural classifications, or classifying expenses by their nature.)",what
What is a nonprofit organization?,"A nonprofit organization is an organization without commercial owners and which addresses the needs of society. Nonprofit organizations are also known as not-for-profits, NFP's or simply as nonprofits. Nonprofit organizations are likely to be involved in areas such as religious, education, health, social services, arts, etc.
Nonprofit organizations may apply to be exempt from federal income taxes. Donors' contributions to nonprofit organizations may or may not be charitable deductions. For more information regarding these issues see Publication 557 at IRS.gov.
A nonprofit organization's financial reporting includes a statement of financial position, a statement of activities, a statement of functional expenses, and a statement of cash flows. Some nonprofits are required to file IRS Form 990 or Form 990-EZ. Since nonprofits do not have commercial owners, the difference between the amounts of assets and liabilities is reported as net assets (instead of owner's or stockholders' equity). The net assets are presented as: without donor restrictions or with donor restrictions.
The typical sources of a nonprofit's revenues are donor contributions, program fees, dues, fundraising events, grants, and investment income. Expenses are presented as program activities or supporting activities (management and general, and fundraising).",what
What is the difference between wages and salary?,"You should be aware that some people use the terms wages and salary interchangeably. I and many others make the following distinction...
Definition of Wages
Wages are usually associated with employee compensation that is based on the number of hours worked multiplied by an hourly rate of pay. Generally, the employees earning hourly wages will be paid in the week that follows the hours worked.
Example of Wages
For example, a warehouse employee works 40 hours during the work week. If the employee's hourly rate of pay is $15, on the 5th day following the work week, the employee will receive a paycheck showing gross wages of $600 (40 x $15). If the employee had worked only 30 hours during the work week, the paycheck will show gross wages of $450 (30 x $15).
Definition of Salary
Salary is associated with employee compensation quoted on an annual basis, such as $50,000 per year. Many employees working in a company's general office will be paid a salary. Often the salaries are paid semi-monthly. That is, one pay date will be the 15th day of the month for working from the 1st to the 15th, and the other pay date will be the last day of the month for working from the 16th to the last day of the month.
Example of Salary
To illustrate, let's assume that the manager of a company might earn a salary of $120,000 per year. If the manager is paid semi-monthly each paycheck will show a gross salary of $5,000 for half a month's work.
Overtime Pay
U.S. and state law protects employees from having to work more than 40 hours per week when their wages or salary is below a certain level. In other words, a salaried employee with a relatively low annual salary must be given overtime compensation if the person's hours worked are greater than 40 hours per week. You should be aware of the federal and state laws for your employees' overtime compensation.",what
What is the difference between biweekly and semimonthly payroll?,"Definition of Biweekly Payroll
Biweekly payroll refers to paydays that occur 26 times per year (52 weeks in a year divided by 2 weeks = 26 times per year). With 26 paydays in the year and 12 months in a year, some months will have 3 biweekly paydays since 26 paydays divided by 12 months = 2.16667 paydays per month.
Definition of Semimonthly Payroll
Semimonthly payroll refers to paydays that occur 24 times per year (12 months in a year multiplied by 2 paydays per month = 24 paydays). With 52 weeks in a year and 12 months in a year, each semimonthly pay period will have on average 2.16667 weeks per semimonthly payday. 
Example of Biweekly Payroll
Let's assume that a company pays its employees biweekly on every other Friday. If a new employee agrees to an annual salary of $52,000 the employee will be earning $2,000 ($52,000 divided by 26 paydays) during each biweekly pay period. The employee's pay records will indicate a gross salary of $2,000 each biweekly payday.
Example of Semimonthly Payroll
Now let's assume that another company pays its employees semimonthly on the 15th day and the last day of every month. If it hires a new employee at an annual salary of $52,000 the employee will be earning $2,166.67 ($52,000 divided by 24 paydays) during each semimonthly pay period. The employee's pay records will indicate a gross salary of $2,166.67 each semimonthly payday.",what
How do you calculate accrued vacation pay?,"Definition of Accrued Vacation Pay
Accrued vacation pay is the amount of vacation pay that a company's employees have earned, but the company has not yet paid.
Example of Accrued Vacation Pay
Let's assume that a company has a formal agreement that provides its employees with 120 hours of paid vacation in the year following the employees' full-time employment. Let's also assume that the company has only one full-time employee who began working at the company on January 1 of the current year and has an hourly pay rate of $26. In the current year, this employee will earn vacation pay of $3,120 (120 hours x $26), or $60 per week ($3,120 per year divided by 52 weeks). This means that in the current year the company must record vacation pay expense and a related liability at a rate of $60 per week.
In our example, the company has only the one full-time employee, so the company's December 31 balance sheet must report a current liability of $3,120.
Vacation pay is an example of an accrued expense and an accrued liability that is required by the matching principle.
Balance Sheet: Retail/Wholesale - Corporation",what
How do I record an advance to an employee and the deduction?,"Definition of Advance to an Employee
A cash advance to an employee is usually a temporary loan by a company to an employee. In other words, the company is the lender and the employee is the borrower.
The cash advance needs to be reported as a reduction in the company's Cash account and an increase in an asset account such as Advance to Employees or Other Receivables: Advances. (If the amount is expected to be repaid within one year, this account will be reported as a current asset.)
If the cash advance is repaid through payroll withholdings, the amount withheld will be recorded as a credit to Advance to Employees.
Example of Advance to an Employee
Let's assume that a valuable employee's car requires an emergency repair of $800. The employee is unable to pay for the repair and has no other means for getting to work. The company agrees to lend the employee $800 and to withhold $100 per week from the employee's weekly payroll checks until the $800 is repaid.
The company will debit the current asset Advance to Employees for $800 and will credit Cash for $800. The weekly payroll processing will result in a credit of $100 to Advance to Employees (thereby reducing the amount that is credited to Cash).",what
What is a fringe benefit rate?,"Definition of Fringe Benefit Rate
A fringe benefit rate is a percentage that results from dividing the cost of an employee's fringe benefits by the wages paid to the employee for the hours actually worked.
Example of Fringe Benefit Rate
Let's assume that a company operates 5 days a week for 8 hours a day for 52 weeks a year resulting in a total of 2,080 hours per year. Next, let's assume that during the year an employee earns $20 per hour, and is entitled to 25 days or 200 hours off with pay (vacation, holidays, sick days). Therefore, the employee's wages for working on the job will be 1,880 hours per year (2,080 hours minus 200 hours) multiplied by $20 per hour = $37,600 for a year.
Next let's assume the following are the annual costs for the fringe benefits earned by the employee and paid by the employer:

$4,000 for paid time off (200 hours X $20)
$7,000 for the employee's health, life and disability insurances
$2,000 for the employee's retirement benefits
$1,000 for worker compensation insurance and unemployment tax
$3,000 for the employer's portion of the Social Security and Medicare taxes

The sum of the above fringe benefit costs paid by the employer is $17,000 for the year.
Dividing the annual fringe benefits cost of $17,000 by the employee's $37,600 of wages for the hours worked, results in a fringe benefit rate of 45.2%. Therefore, when a company pays the employee gross wages of $20 per hour worked, the company's cost is $29.04 per hour. (This is the $20 of gross wages per hour plus the $9.04 fringe benefit cost per hour.) Similarly, the employee is earning $29.04 for every hour worked.",what
Where should I enter unpaid wages?,"Definition of Unpaid Wages
Unpaid wages are usually the amounts that hourly-paid employees have earned, but have not yet been paid to the employees. 
Entering Unpaid Wages
Under the accrual basis of accounting, unpaid wages that have been earned by employees but have not yet been recorded in the accounting records should be entered or recorded through an accrual adjusting entry which will:

Debit Wages Expense
Credit Wages Payable or credit Accrued Wages Payable

Wages Expense is an income statement account. Wages Payable or Accrued Wages Payable is a current liability account that is reported on the balance sheet.",what
What is payroll accounting?,"Definition of Payroll Accounting
Payroll accounting involves a company's recording of its employees' compensation including:

gross wages, salaries, bonuses, commissions, and so on that have been earned by its employees
withholding of payroll taxes such as federal income taxes, Social Security taxes, Medicare taxes,  state income taxes (if applicable)
withholding for the employees' portion of health insurance premiums, employees' contributions to savings plans, garnishments of salaries and wages, employees' contributions to United Way, etc.
employer's portion/expense for Social Security taxes, Medicare taxes, state and federal unemployment taxes
employer's portion/expense of fringe benefits such as health and dental insurance, paid holidays, vacations and sick days, pension and savings plan contributions, worker compensation insurance, etc.

Example of Payroll Accounting
If a company's employees are paid weekly based on hours worked, the payroll processing is likely done during the first few days following the work week. If the company's accounting periods are calendar months (and the calendar year), the company will have to accrue for the wages and benefits earned by the hourly paid employees (which are not yet paid or recorded in the general ledger accounts) as of the last day of each month.
You can see more details including journal entries at our free Explanation of Payroll Accounting.",what
What is accrued payroll?,"Definition of Accrued Payroll
Accrued payroll includes wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses, and other payroll related expenses that have been earned by a company's employees, but have not yet been paid or recorded in the company's general ledger accounts.
Example of Accrued Payroll
Let's assume that a retailer's hourly-paid employees are paid each Friday for the hours they worked during the previous week. Let's also assume that as of December 31, the hours worked from December 27 through December 31 will be part of the payroll that will be processed in early January and paid to the employees on Friday, January 8. The amount of the wages for the five days of December 27 through December 31 are calculated to be $5,000. In addition, the retailer incurred payroll taxes and fringe benefits amounting to $1,000. Therefore, the total amount of accrued payroll is $6,000.
Under the accrual basis of accounting, the retailer must report the $6,500 of accrued payroll as:

An expense on its income statement for the period ended December 31
Current liability on its balance sheet as of December 31

The retailer will accomplish this by preparing an accrual adjusting entry dated as of December 31.",what
Are payroll withholding taxes an expense or a liability?,"Definition of Payroll Withholding Taxes
Payroll withholding taxes are amounts withheld from employees' wages and salaries. The amounts withheld are actually the employees' money that the employer is required by law to withhold and remit to the government. In other words, the employer is acting as an agent by withholding and remitting the employees' money.
Examples of Payroll Withholding Taxes
The payroll taxes withheld from employees include federal income taxes, state income taxes, and the employees' portion of the FICA or Social Security and Medicare taxes.
Payroll Withholdings are Liabilities
The payroll taxes withheld from employees are a current liability of the employer until the amounts are remitted to the governments. (The taxes withheld from employees are not an expense of the company that withheld them.) 
The payroll taxes that are not withheld from employees are expenses of the employer and are liabilities until the amounts are remitted. Examples include the employer's portion of the FICA tax and unemployment taxes.",what
What is recorded in the Wages and Salaries Expense account?,"Definition of Wages and Salaries Expense
The account Wages and Salaries Expense (or separate accounts such as Wages Expense or Salaries Expense) are used to record the amounts earned by employees during the accounting period under the accrual basis of accounting.
Example of Wages and Salaries Expense
Assume that a new service business begins in December and has a staff of 6 hourly-paid employees who are paid each Friday for the hours they worked during the previous week. As of December 31, the hourly-paid employees have earned $3,000 of wages for which they will be paid on the first Friday in January. In order to comply with the matching principle, the account Wages and Salaries Expense must include the $3,000 of wages in order to match the December wages expense with the December revenues. As a result, the December's income statement will present an accurate picture of December's profits and the balance sheet will report the liability for the wages owed as of December 31.",what
What is the self-employed person's FICA tax rate for 2019 and 2020?,"2019 FICA Tax Rate for Self-Employed
The self-employed person's FICA tax rate for 2019 (January 1 through December 31, 2019) is 15.3% on the first $132,900 of net income plus 2.9% on the net income in excess of $132,900. In other words, the self-employed person's FICA tax rate for 2019 includes all of the following:

 the employee's portion of the Social Security tax, which is 6.2% of the first $132,900 of net income
 the employer's portion of the Social Security tax, which is 6.2% of the first $132,900 of net income
 the employee's portion of the Medicare tax, which is 1.45% of all net income (no cap or limit on net income)
 the employer's portion of the Medicare tax, which is 1.45% of all net income (no cap or limit on net income)

A self-employed person having net income of exactly $132,900 in 2019 must remit FICA taxes of $20,333.70 ($132,900 X 15.3%).
2020 FICA Tax Rate for Self-Employed
The self-employed person's FICA tax rate for 2020 (January 1 through December 31, 2020) is 15.3% on the first $137,700 of net income plus 2.9% on the net income in excess of $137,700. In other words, the self-employed person's FICA tax rate for 2020 includes all of the following:

 the employee's portion of the Social Security tax, which is 6.2% of the first $137,700 of net income
 the employer's portion of the Social Security tax, which is 6.2% of the first $137,700 of net income
 the employee's portion of the Medicare tax, which is 1.45% of all net income (no cap or limit on net income)
 the employer's portion of the Medicare tax, which is 1.45% of all net income (no cap or limit on net income)

A self-employed person having net income of exactly $137,700 in 2020 must remit FICA taxes of $21,068.10 ($137,700 X 15.3%).
There is also an Additional Medicare Tax that applies to higher income taxpayers. Information on the Medicare surtax and other income tax information can be found at www.irs.gov.",what
What is the FUTA tax?,"FUTA (Federal Unemployment Tax Act) tax is a payroll or employment tax paid solely by the employer. While the FUTA tax is paid by the employer, it is based on each employee's wages or salary. Generally, the FUTA tax ends up being 0.6% (6% minus a credit of 5.4%) of the first $7,000 per year of each employee's wages or salary. That means the employer's maximum cost for FUTA per year per employee is $42 ($7,000 x 0.006). If an employee earns $5,000 during a calendar year, the employer's cost is $30 ($5,000 x 0.006).
In the double-entry system of accounting, the FUTA tax results in 1) a credit to a liability account, and 2) a debit to an expense account if the employees are not involved in the manufacturing of products. (For employees involved in manufacturing, their FUTA tax is part of the cost of the products.)",what
Where do you account for payroll taxes on the income statement?,"The only payroll taxes that will appear on the income statement are the ones that the employers must pay: the employers' matching portion of the Social Security and Medicare taxes (FICA) and the federal and state unemployment taxes. (The payroll taxes withheld from employees' wages and salaries are not company expenses.) Employer-paid fringe benefit costs other than payroll taxes (employers' share of health insurance, holiday and vacation pay, retirement contributions, etc.) will also appear on the income statement—however, we will focus on the payroll taxes.
The employer-paid FICA and unemployment taxes should appear as an expense in the same period that the employees' wages and salaries are expensed. The payroll tax expense is part of each employee's compensation and should be matched with the associated revenues if possible, or matched to the period when the wages and salaries occurred.
For example, if a company does not manufacture products, the company-paid payroll taxes are likely to be part of the selling and administrative salary and wage expenses. These will be reported on the income statement in the accounting period when the wages and salaries were earned by the employee.
If the company is a manufacturer of products, the company-paid payroll taxes should be reported along with the respective wages and salaries. Let's assume that a company has $1,000,000 of direct labor; $2,000,000 of indirect manufacturing wages and salaries; and $3,000,000 of selling and administrative salaries. Let's also assume that the employer-paid FICA and unemployment taxes amount to $600,000 of which $120,000 is associated with the direct labor; $200,000 is associated with the indirect manufacturing wages and salaries; and $280,000 is associated with selling and administrative salaries. The $280,000 of payroll taxes pertaining to the selling and administration functions will appear on the income statement of the accounting period in which those employees earned the salaries (and the company incurred the expense). The $320,000 of employer-paid payroll taxes for employees working in the manufacturing activities of the company will be assigned to the products. When the products are sold, the assigned costs will appear on the income statement as part of the Cost of Goods Sold. If the products are not sold, these costs will be included as part of the products' cost that are reported as Inventory on the balance sheet.",what
What is the employer matching of FICA?,"FICA is the acronym for Federal Insurance Contributions Act. It generally requires employers to withhold Social Security and Medicare taxes from their employees' earnings (wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses, etc.) and then match the amounts withheld. This means that employers must remit to the government two times the amount withheld from their employees for Social Security and Medicare taxes.
For example, if an employer has only one employee earning $30,000 per year, the employer must withhold $2,295 of FICA tax from the employee. (6.2% for the Social Security tax of $1,860, plus 1.45% for the Medicare tax of $435.) The employer must then match the $2,295 and remit the total of $4,590 to the federal government. 
The employer's cost of matching the FICA taxes (the matching amounts for the Social Security tax and Medicare tax) is recorded by the employer as an additional expense or manufacturing cost.
You can find the rules for FICA taxes in the Internal Revenue Service Publication 15 (Circular E) Employer's Tax Guide at its website www.irs.gov.",what
How do you calculate the payroll accrual?,"The payroll accrual is the amount that needs to be entered into a liability account in order for the credit balance in the liability account to be the amount owed to employees. The amount owed is the amount the employees have earned from working, but as of the date of the balance sheet this amount has not been paid to the employees.
To illustrate the payroll accrual, assume that a company's employees were paid on September 30 for their work through September 25. The credit balance needed in the liability account as of September 30 is the amount that the employees earned for the days of September 26 through September 30.",what
What is the difference between Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes?,"Social Security Payroll Tax
The Social Security payroll tax is 6.2% and is based on each employee's earnings (including wages, salaries, bonuses, commissions, etc.) up to a specified annual ceiling, limit, or maximum.
In the calendar year 2019, the Social Security payroll tax rate of 6.2% is applied to each employee's earnings up to the maximum of $132,900. The 6.2% that is withheld from the employee is also matched by the employer. As a result, the total Social Security tax in 2019 for an employee is equal to 12.4% of each employee's annual earnings up to a maximum earnings amount of $132,900.
In the calendar year 2020, the Social Security payroll tax rate of 6.2% is applied to each employee's earnings up to the maximum of $137,700. The 6.2% that is withheld from the employee is also matched by the employer. As a result, the total Social Security tax in 2020 for an employee is equal to 12.4% of each employee's annual earnings up to a maximum earnings amount of $137,700.
Medicare Payroll Tax
The Medicare payroll tax is 1.45% and is based on each employee's earnings without limit. The Medicare tax is withheld from each employee's earnings and is also matched by the employer. This makes the total Medicare tax equal to 2.9% on every dollar of earnings. (There is also an Additional Medicare Tax for high income employees and self-employed individuals. However, the Additional Medicare Tax is not matched by the employer.)
FICA Payroll Tax
The combination of Social Security taxes and Medicare taxes is referred to as FICA. We often refer to the FICA tax rate as 7.65% (6.2% Social Security + 1.45% Medicare) of each employee's first $132,900 of annual earnings in 2019 and the first $137,700 of annual earnings in 2020. Each employee's earnings in excess of the annual ceiling amount are taxed only for Medicare at 1.45% for the employee and 1.45% for the employer. (There is also an Additional Medicare Tax that is withheld from high income employees' pay, but the employer does not match the Additional Medicare Tax amounts.)
Self-employed persons are responsible for both the employee and employer portions.
Social Security involves retirement and disability benefits. Medicare involves health care for people 65 years of age and older.",what
What is FICA?,"Definition of FICA
FICA is the acronym for Federal Insurance Contributions Act. FICA refers to the combination of the U.S. Social Security payroll tax and the Medicare payroll tax.
For the calendar year 2019, the FICA payroll tax consists of:

 The Social Security tax of 6.2% withheld from the first $132,900 of each employee's earnings (wages, salaries, etc.) in the year 2019 (January 1 through December 31, 2019).
 The Medicare tax of 1.45% withheld from the total amount of an employee's 2019 earnings. (There is no earnings cap or limit for the Medicare tax.)

For the calendar year 2020, the FICA payroll tax consists of:

 The Social Security tax of 6.2% withheld from the first $137,700 of each employee's earnings in the year 2020 (January 1 through December 31, 2020).
 The Medicare tax of 1.45% withheld from the total amount of an employee's 2020 earnings. (There is no earnings cap or limit for the Medicare tax.)

FICA is Paid by Employees and Employer
In addition, the employer must match the FICA taxes withheld from its employees. This means that the employer will have an additional expense equal to the total of the FICA taxes withheld from its employees (except that the employer does not match the Additional Medicare Tax). The employer has the responsibility to remit to the federal government both the FICA that was withheld from its employees plus the employer's matching amount.
A self-employed person must pay both the employee portion and the employer portion of the FICA tax.

"Under accrual accounting, how are worker comp premiums handled?","Worker comp insurance premiums should be charged to the areas where the related wages and salaries are charged.
Let's assume that the net cost of worker comp insurance after discounts and dividends is 5% of the wages and salaries of direct and indirect manufacturing employees. If for the month of January the direct labor is $40,000, then $2,000 of the worker comp cost should be included as direct labor. If indirect labor for January is $60,000 then $3,000 of worker comp cost should be included as the cost of the indirect labor.
If the general office worker comp rates are 0.2% of the general office wages and salaries, then 0.2% of January's general office wages and salaries will be expensed as worker comp insurance expense.
If the employer remits each month's worker comp cost to its insurance company each accounting period, there will be no prepaid insurance nor will there be a liability for accrued worker comp expense.
If the employer remits worker comp premiums to the insurance company in advance of the cost associated with wages and salaries, the amount that is prepaid as of the balance sheet date should be reported as Prepaid Insurance, a current asset. If the employer has remitted less than the worker comp cost associated with the wages and salaries, the amount owed to the insurance company as of the balance sheet date is reported as a current liability such as Accrued Worker Comp Payable.",what
How do you account for payroll withholdings for health insurance?,"Let's assume that the cost of an employee's health insurance is $300 per pay period and that the employee is responsible for paying 25% of that cost through payroll withholding. One way to handle the withholding is to credit Health Insurance Expense for the $75 (25% of $300) withheld from the employee. The company will then debit Health Insurance Expense for the full insurance billing of $300. This will result in $225 being reported as the company's health insurance expense for that pay period.
An alternative would be to credit a liability (e.g., Employee Withholdings for Insurance) for the $75 withheld from the employee. When the company pays the insurance bill of $300, it will debit the liability account for $75.
Under either method, the company's expense is $225 per pay period.",what
How do the income statements of a sole proprietorship and a regular corporation differ?,"The income statement of a sole proprietorship will not report any salary expense for the sole proprietor who works in the business. However, if the business is a regular corporation, the income statement will report as salary expense the amount that the stockholder earned by working in the business.
Another difference involves income tax expense. The income statement of a sole proprietorship will not report income tax expense, since the owner (and not the business) is responsible for U.S. income taxes. On the other hand, a regular corporation is a taxpaying entity and it is responsible for U.S. income taxes.
As a result of these two differences, the net income (which is the bottom line of the income statements) will be different. In the case of the sole proprietorship, the net income is the total amount that the owner has earned before income taxes for 1) the capital invested in the business and 2) the owner's compensation for working in the business. In the case of a regular corporation owned by one person, the owner has earned the salary (which was included in salary expense on the income statement) and has also earned the reported amount of net income or net loss.
Neither the draws made by the sole proprietor nor the dividends distributed by a regular corporation are reported on the income statement.",what
What are payroll withholding taxes?,"In the U.S. payroll withholding taxes are the taxes that an employer is required to deduct from its employees' gross wages, salaries, bonuses, and other compensation.
The typical payroll withholding taxes include each employee's portion of the Social Security and Medicare taxes (also referred to as FICA), federal income tax, and often state income tax. (A few cities and states may also require additional payroll taxes.)
After deducting the payroll withholding taxes from its employees, the employer is required to remit the amounts in a timely manner to the appropriate government.
In addition to payroll withholding taxes, most employers also withhold nontax amounts for insurances, savings plans, union dues, court-ordered garnishments, and so on.",what
Where do worker compensation insurance costs get reported on the financial statements?,"Worker compensation insurance costs (also referred to as worker comp) should appear on the income statement and also on the balance sheet.
If a company is a manufacturer, the costs of worker compensation insurance for the employees in the manufacturing operations should be included in the costs of the products manufactured. The products that have been sold will have their costs (including their share of worker compensation costs) reported as the cost of goods sold on the income statement. The costs associated with the unsold products (including their share of worker compensation costs) will be reported as inventory in the current asset section of the balance sheet. The worker compensation costs associated with selling and general administration should be reported as an expense on the income statement.
Any worker compensation insurance costs that have been prepaid should be reported as a current asset (such as Prepaid Insurance) on the balance sheet. Any worker compensation premiums that have been incurred, but not yet remitted to the insurance company, should be reported as a current liability.",what

The employee's Social Security payroll tax rate for 2019 (January 1 through December 31, 2019) is 6.2% of the first $132,900 of wages, salaries, etc. An employee's 2019 earnings in excess of $132,900 are not subject to the Social Security tax.
Social Security Payroll Tax for 2020
The employee's Social Security payroll tax rate for 2020 (January 1 through December 31, 2020) is 6.2% of the first $137,700 of wages, salaries, etc. An employee's 2020 earnings in excess of $137,700 are not subject to the Social Security tax.
Social Security Payroll Tax is One Part of the FICA Payroll Tax
The Social Security payroll tax is one of the two components of the FICA payroll tax. The other component is the Medicare tax which applies to every dollar of an employee's earnings. In other words, there is no wage limit or cap for the Medicare tax. In fact, there is also an Additional Medicare Tax that applies to high income employees.
An Employer Must Match its Employees' FICA Taxes
In addition to the employees' Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes, the employer must match the amounts that were withheld from the employees' paychecks (except that the employer does not match the Additional Medicare Tax).",what
What is the employer's Social Security tax rate for 2019 and 2020?,"Employer's Social Security Payroll Tax for 2019
The employer's Social Security payroll tax rate for 2019 (January 1 through December 31, 2019) is the same as the employee's Social Security payroll tax: 6.2% of each employee's first $132,900 of wages, salaries, etc. If an employee's 2019 wages, salaries, etc. exceed $132,900, the amount in excess of $132,900 is not subject to the Social Security tax. Hence, the maximum amount of the employer's Social Security tax for each employee in 2019 is $8,239.80 (6.2% X $132,900).
Employer's Social Security Payroll Tax for 2020
The employer's Social Security payroll tax rate for 2020 (January 1 through December 31, 2020) is 6.2% of each employee's first $137,700 of wages, salaries, etc. (This amount is identical to the employee's Social Security tax that is withheld from the employee's wages, salaries, etc.) If an employee's wages, salaries, etc. are greater than $137,700, the amount in excess of $137,700 is not subject to the Social Security tax. Hence, the maximum amount of the employer's Social Security tax for each employee in 2020 is $8,537.40 (6.2% X $137,700).
Since employees also have the Social Security payroll tax withheld from their wages, salaries, etc., the employer is in effect matching each employee's Social Security payroll tax. The employer must remit both the amounts withheld from employees' wages and the employer's matching amount to the U.S. government.
Social Security Payroll Tax is One Part of the FICA Payroll Tax
In addition to the Social Security payroll tax, there is also a Medicare payroll tax of 1.45% and an Additional Medicare Tax for higher income taxpayers. (The combination of the Social Security tax and the Medicare tax is referred to as FICA.) The employer must match each employee's Medicare tax of 1.45% (but does not match the employee's Additional Medicare Tax).

How do I determine my payroll tax liabilities?,"Your payroll tax liabilities will include the following:

Federal, state, and local income taxes withheld from employees' wages, salaries, bonuses, etc. but not yet remitted.
The unremitted Social Security and Medicare taxes that were to be withheld plus your company's matching of those taxes.
State and federal unemployment taxes not yet remitted. Your state can tell you the rate for your company and the wages to which the rate applies. For example, it might be 5% on the first $9,000 of annual wages and salaries. The federal rate (after credit) is 0.6% on the first $7,000 of annual wages and salaries.

In addition to the payroll taxes, you may have payroll related liabilities for worker compensation insurance, health insurance, 401-k contributions, pensions, vacations, and so on.",what
What is workers' compensation insurance?,"Workers' compensation insurance is likely to be an insurance policy obtained by a company to cover the medical costs and lost wages for its employees' work-related injuries and illnesses. In the U.S. each state determines the ""worker comp"" insurance that companies must provide.
The cost of the workers' compensation insurance is paid by the employer. Many view the cost as another fringe benefit and will include the cost in its fringe benefit rate. Hence, the cost of workers' compensation insurance for production workers will be an additional product cost. The cost of workers' compensation insurance for the office staff will be a period cost and will be expensed immediately as part of SG&A.
The cost of workers' compensation insurance varies by the type of work performed, each employee's annual pay, and the company's experience rating. In other words, the cost of workers' compensation insurance will be highest when the work performed is dangerous, the employees in those jobs have high annual pay, and the company has a history of many injuries. On the other hand, the workers' compensation insurance cost will be very low for an office clerk who never enters the factory area.
It is important not to confuse worker comp with unemployment comp.",what
What if an employee's actual vacation payment is greater than the amount that has been accrued?,"Let's assume that a company's accounting year ends on December 31 and the company has only one employee who worked the full year. The company's handbook specifies that the employee earns 10 hours of vacation for each month worked. However, the vacation hours for the year accumulate. The total vacation hours earned as of December 31 will be paid to the employee on June 1 of the following year by using the employee's June 1 pay rate.
Next, let's assume that each month the company records an accrual adjusting entry that debits Vacation Expense for $200 (10 hours X $20 per hour) and credits Vacation Liability for $200. As a result, the balance in the balance sheet account Vacation Liability at December 31 is $2,400 (12 months X $200, or 120 hours X $20).
On the following June 1, the employee's pay rate is $20.50 which means the employee's gross vacation pay will be $2,460 (120 hours X $20.50). The June 1 journal entry to record the vacation payment is:

Debit Vacation Payable $2,400 (to eliminate the December 31 liability)
Debit Vacation Expense $60
Credit Cash, Payroll Withholdings, etc. for a total of $2,460

Note that the $60 difference was recorded as Vacation Expense in the year of the payment. The financial statements of the prior year were not restated for the $5 monthly differences. The reason is the prior year's monthly amounts were estimates (not mistakes) and the difference is immaterial.",what
What is the maximum amount of earnings subject to the Social Security tax in 2019 and 2020?,"2019 Annual Earnings Limit for Social Security Payroll Tax
The maximum amount of an employee's 2019 earnings (and a self-employed person's net income) that is subject to the Social Security payroll tax is $132,900. This amount is also known as the Social Security annual limit, wage base, contribution and benefit base, ceiling, tax cap, and maximum taxable earnings. The maximum amount is adjusted annually based on the national average wage index. 
2020 Annual Earnings Limit for Social Security Payroll Tax
For the calendar year 2020 (January 1 through December 31, 2020) the maximum amount of an employee's earnings that is subject to the Social Security payroll tax is $137,700.
An Employer Must Match Its Employees' Social Security Payroll Taxes
The earnings limits are used to compute the employee's maximum Social Security tax and therefore the employer's maximum Social Security payroll tax for each employee. (The employer is required to match each employee's withholdings of the Social Security tax and must remit both the employees' withholdings and the employer's matching amount to the U.S. government.)
Social Security Payroll Tax is One Part of the FICA Payroll Tax

Are salaried employees entitled to overtime pay?,"Some salaried employees are entitled to overtime pay. The salaried employees entitled to overtime pay are referred to as nonexempt employees. Nonexempt means that the employer is not exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act, which requires that salaried employees having a gross salary of less than $455 per week for a 40-hour work week must receive overtime pay when working more than the normal 40 hours.
In addition to the U.S. Department of Labor's Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), the state in which the employer operates will likely have rules regarding overtime pay (and minimum wage). The employer is required to comply with the rules that are more protective of the employees.
In short, an employer cannot avoid paying overtime merely by classifying an employee as ""salaried"".
The ""standard salary level"" of $455 per week is expected to increase on January 1, 2020 to $684 per week. For a full-year employee, this means the current annual amount of $23,660 ($455 X 52 weeks) will become $35,568.
You should refer to both the U.S. Department of Labor (Wage and Hour Division) and your state's labor department for the complete rules and exemptions regarding overtime pay.",what

How do you calculate staff turnover?,"To calculate staff turnover, I would use the W-2 wage statements for the most recent year.
My first step would be to sort the W-2's into meaningful groups such as full-time professional, full-time clerical, and part-time. (Perhaps you will sort your company's W-2's by department.)
For each group, I would count the number of W-2's for people that were no longer employed at the end of the year. Let's assume that 6 full-time professional, 3 full-time clerical, and 5 part-time employees had W-2's but they had left the company before the end of the year.
Next I would divide the counts of people who had left by the average number of filled positions in the company during that year. Let's assume that on average the number of filled positions during the year were 20 full-time professional, 6 full-time clerical, and 8 part-time.
The staff turnover for full-time professional would be 30% (the 6 people leaving during the year divided by the company's 20 positions). For the full-time clerical, the staff turnover rate is 3 divided by 6, for a rate of 50%. For the part-time employees, the staff turnover rate is 62.5% (5 leaving divided by 8 positions).
After computing the staff turnover, be sure to discuss the staff turnover rate with the company's management. Training new employees only to have an above average person leave after the training period is very expensive.",what
"Why are wages reported as an expense when the work occurs, but the employees' tax records report them when they are paid?","Accrual Method for the Corporation, Cash Method for the Employees
The short answer is that the corporation's financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting (generally accepted accounting principles), while the employee payroll records for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires the cash method of accounting.
Example of the Corporation's Wages Expense (Based on Work Dates)
To illustrate, let's assume that a new retailer (that uses the accrual method of accounting) begins operations on December 27. The employees working from December 27 through December 31 will receive their first paychecks on January 4. If the employees earn a total of $5,000 of wages during the five days ending on December 31, the retailer's general ledger and financial statements for the period ending December 31 must report wages expense of $5,000 and a liability of $5,000 as of December 31. In accounting jargon, the retailer must accrue the expense and liability through an adjusting entry dated December 31.
Example of the Employees' Earnings Reported to IRS (Based on Pay Dates)
The retailer's payroll department must report to the IRS the wages paid. Therefore, the amount reported to the IRS is based on the pay dates. Since January 4 is the first time the employees will be paid, the employees' wages earned during December 27-31 will be reported to the IRS as January wages.",what
How do you determine whether a person is an independent contractor or an employee?,"To assist you in determining whether someone is an independent contractor or an employee, you should refer to the Internal Revenue Service Publication 15-A, Employer's Supplemental Tax Guide.

What is the annual wage limit?,"Definition of Annual Wage Limit
Annual wage limit is a term in payroll accounting associated with the Social Security payroll tax. The annual wage limit is also known as the annual wage base, wage ceiling, taxable maximum, and maximum taxable earnings. The annual wage limit applies to only the Social Security payroll tax portion of the FICA payroll tax. (There is no annual wage limit for the Medicare payroll tax portion of FICA.)
The annual wage limit for the Social Security tax is adjusted each year. In 2020, the annual wage limit is $137,700. This means that in the year 2020, only the first $137,700 of an employee's (or self-employed's) gross wages, salaries, bonuses, etc. will be subject to the Social Security tax of 6.2%. In addition to the amounts withheld from its employees, the employer must match the amount of the Social Security taxes. (Self-employed individuals must pay both the employee and the employer portions of the payroll tax.)
Example of Annual Wage Limit
Assume that an employee has gross wages of $150,000 during the year 2020. Only $137,700 of the employee's wages are subject to the Social Security tax of 6.2%. As a result, the amount withheld from the employee's pay for the Social Security tax will be $8,537.40 ($137,700 X 0.062). In addition, the employer must match the amount withheld and must remit $17,074.80 ($8,537.40 + $8,537.40) to the U.S. Treasury.
No Annual Wage Limit for Medicare Tax
Unlike the Social Security tax, the Medicare tax does not have an annual wage limit. Therefore, every dollar of the employees' gross pay is subject to the Medicare tax of 1.45% and must be matched by the employer.",what
What are gross wages?,"Definition of Gross Wages
Gross wages are the amounts earned by employees before the payroll withholding taxes and other deductions are subtracted. Sometimes gross wages is used to describe the amounts earned by hourly-paid employees. However, it is common for gross wages to mean all forms of taxable compensation including wages, salaries, tips, commissions, bonuses, etc.
Gross Wages vs Net Wages
If an employee works 40 hours during the week of December 25-31 and earns $20 per hour, the gross wages earned are $800.
Net wages are an employee's gross wages minus the deductions for payroll withholding taxes and other items. If the gross pay is $800 and the total payroll deductions amount to $200, the employee's net wages will be $600. Net wages is also known as the net pay, take-home pay, and/or the amount that the employee ""clears"". 
How Gross Wages Are Reported
Under the accrual basis of accounting, the employer will report on its financial statements the gross wages that were earned by the employees (and incurred by the employer) during the accounting period. 
[Under the cash basis of accounting, the employer's financial statements will report gross wages based on the amounts that were paid to the employees during the accounting period.]
The amount that the employer reports to the Internal Revenue Service on employee's Form W-2 Wage and Tax Statement is the amount of the gross wages that were paid to the employee during the calendar year.
Example of Wages on Financial Statements vs W-2
Under the accrual basis of accounting, if an employee earns gross wages of $800 in the last week in December, the gross wages (and related amounts) are reported on the company's December financial statements.
However, if the wages earned during the week of December 25-31 are not paid until January 5, the wages will be included in the W-2 form for the year in which they are paid.",what
What is Additional Medicare Tax?,"Definition of Additional Medicare Tax
The Additional Medicare Tax is one of the U.S. government's payroll withholding taxes that is paid solely by employees and the self-employed. In other words, the employer does not match the Additional Medicare Tax. The Additional Medicare Tax is 0.9% (0.009) of an employee's gross pay (wages, salaries, bonuses, etc.) that are in excess of $200,000 during a calendar year.
The Additional Medicare Tax is in addition to the (regular) Medicare payroll tax and the Social Security payroll tax.
Related: What is the difference between Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes? 
Example of Additional Medicare Tax
Sam is employed by Jones Corporation and had gross pay of $300,000 during the year. In addition to the regular Medicare tax (and the Social Security tax), Sam must pay the Additional Medicare Tax. In Sam's case, the Additional Medicare Tax is 0.9% of $100,000 (Sam's gross pay of $300,000 minus $200,000) which amounts to $900. The $900 is withheld from Sam's gross pay and is remitted by Jones Corporation to the U.S. Treasury.
Difference between Medicare Tax and Additional Medicare Tax
The Medicare tax is withheld from an employee's gross pay without limit at the rate of 1.45% of gross pay. In our example, Sam's regular Medicare tax for the year is $4,350 ($300,000 X 0.0145). Jones Corporation must match the regular Medicare tax withholding and therefore must remit $8,700 ($4,350 + $4,350) to the U.S. Treasury.
The Additional Medicare Tax is paid only by Sam through payroll withholding. Jones Corporation does not match the Additional Medicare Tax and remits the $900 that was withheld from Sam's gross pay. Information on the Additional Medicare Tax can be found at www.irs.gov.",what
What is gross pay?,"Definition of Gross Pay
Gross pay is the amount an employee is paid before the employer withholds FICA (Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes), income taxes (federal, state, local) if applicable, and other amounts such as wage garnishments, insurance payments, union dues, savings and retirement contributions, etc.
Gross Pay vs Net Pay
Net pay is the amount remaining after payroll taxes and other amounts are deducted from an employee's gross pay. Net pay is the amount of the employee's paycheck, which is often referred to as the employee's ""take-home pay"" or the amount the employee ""cleared"".
How Gross Pay is Calculated
Some employees' gross pay is determined by multiplying the hours worked times the employee's hourly pay rate. For instance, if an employee works 40 hours in the workweek and has a $25 per hour pay rate, the employee's gross pay for the week is $1,000. If the employee works 30 hours in the following week, the employee's gross pay will be $750 (30 hours X $25).
Some employees' gross pay is in the form of a salary. Often salaried employees are paid semimonthly or biweekly. For example, if an administrative assistant has an annual gross salary of $48,000 per year, the person's semimonthly gross pay will be $2,000 ($48,000/24 pay periods). A person with an annual gross salary of $48,000 who is paid biweekly will have a biweekly gross pay of $1,846 ($48,000/26 pay periods).
Gross pay can also include commissions based on sales, pieces produced per hour, bonuses based on achieving a stated goal, etc.",what
What is the difference between an implicit cost and an explicit cost?,"Definition of Implicit Cost
An implicit cost is present but it is not initially shown or reported as a separate cost. 
Definition of Explicit Cost
An explicit cost is a cost that is present and it is clearly shown or reported as a separate cost. 
Examples of Implicit Costs and Explicit Costs
Let's assume that a company gives a promissory note for $10,000 to a seller of a unique used machine for which the fair value is unknown. The promissory note will come due in three years and it does not specify any interest. Due to the company's weak financial position it would normally have to pay a high interest rate if it were able to borrow money. In this example, the promissory note does not show an explicit interest cost. However, due to the issuer's weak financial position and the seller having to wait three years to collect the money, there has to be some interest cost. In other words, there is some interest cost, but it is implicit. (To record the interest cost, accountants will discount the $10,000 by the approximate interest rate that the maker of the note would normally have to pay.)
If another company with the same financial condition purchased this unique machine by issuing a $7,120 note with a stated interest rate of 12% per year (and the rate is a fair interest rate for the situation), the compounded interest cost of $2,880 is explicit.
Another example of an implicit cost is the opportunity cost of a sole proprietor working in her own business. For example, Jane works as a sole proprietor and her business reported a net income of $30,000 for the year. Since a sole proprietor does not receive a salary or wages, there is no explicit cost reported for Jane's work in her business. However, if Jane is foregoing a salary of $40,000 from another company, this is an implicit cost. When considering this implicit cost, Jane is losing $10,000 by working in her proprietorship.
If Jane operated her business as a corporation, Jane will be an employee of the corporation and her annual salary will be an explicit cost presented as salary expense on the corporation's income statement.",what
What does per annum mean?,"Definition of Per Annum
Per annum means yearly or annually. It is a common phrase used to describe an interest rate. Often ""per annum"" is omitted, as in ""I have a 4% mortgage loan."" or ""This bond pays interest of 6%.""
Example of Per Annum
An example involves a supplier offering a credit customer an early-payment discount of 2% for paying an invoice in 10 days instead of paying the full amount in 30 days. In this example the supplier is giving up 2% of the invoice amount in order to be paid 20 days early.
To compute the rate per annum we restate the amounts by multiplying both the ""2%"" and the ""20 days"" by 18 (in order to get close to the 365 days in a year). The result is a per annum rate of approximately 36%.
Another example involves a business charging its customers 1.5% per month on any past due balance. The monthly rate of 1.5% can be converted to 18% per annum by multiplying the 1.5% times 12 months in a year.",what
What is NPV?,"Definition of NPV
NPV is the acronym for net present value, which can be calculated as follows:

The present value of the future cash inflows
Minus the cash investment

Example of NPV
Assume that a company makes a cash investment of $500,000 in a project that is expected to provide future cash inflows of $100,000 at the end of each year for 10 years.
The future cash receipts of $100,000 at the end of each year for 10 years needs to be discounted to their present value. If the future cash amounts are discounted by 14% per year compounded annually (the company's required return), it will result in a present value of approximately $522,000.
The $522,000 of present value coming in minus the $500,000 of present value going out results is a positive net present value of $22,000. In other words, the company will earn slightly more than 14% per year on its $500,000 investment.",what
What is the difference between Present Value (PV) and Net Present Value (NPV)?,"Definition of Present Value (PV)
Present value or PV is the result of discounting one or more future amounts to the present. The greater the discount rate, the smaller the present value.
Examples of Present Value
A cash amount of $10,000 received at the end of 5 years will have a present value (PV) of $6,210 when the $10,000 is discounted at 10% compounded annually. If the $10,000 is discounted at 12% compounded annually, the present value will be $5,670.
Definition of Net Present Value (NPV)
Net present value is the result of discounting all of the cash inflows and outflows and then combining all of their present values. This means that the original outflow (often the investment made at the present time) is a deduction from the other present values.
A positive net present value indicates that an investment is earning more than the discount rate. A negative net present value indicates an investment is earning less than the discount rate, but may be earning a positive rate. For example, if the cash flows are discounted by 12%, a slightly negative NPV could mean that the investment is earning 11%. 
Examples of Net Present Value
Assume that an investment of $5,000 today will result in one cash receipt of $10,000 at the end of 5 years. If the investor requires a 10% annual return compounded annually, the net present value (NPV) of the investment is $1,210. This is the result of combining the present value of the cash inflow $6,210 (from the example above) and the $5,000 (which is the present of the $5,000 paid today).
Assuming the same information, except that the rate for discounting the cash amounts is 12%, the net present value (NPV) is $670. This is the $5,670 present value of the cash inflow combined with the present value of the $5,000 cash outflow.",what
What is hurdle rate?,"Definition of Hurdle Rate
In capital budgeting, the term hurdle rate is the minimum rate that a company wants to earn when investing in a project. Therefore, the hurdle rate is also referred to as the company's required rate of return or target rate. For a company to further consider a project, its internal rate of return must equal or exceed the hurdle rate.
The hurdle rate is also used to discount a project's future cash flows to its net present value.
Example of Hurdle Rate
The absolute minimum hurdle rate should be the company's cost of capital (a blend of the cost of debt and the cost of equity). However, the hurdle rate is usually larger than the cost of capital when the company has many investment opportunities and for projects that have a higher level of risk.",what
What is an implicit interest rate?,"Definition of Implicit Interest Rate
An implicit interest rate is one that is not stated explicitly.
Example of Implicit Interest Rate
Assume that I lend you $4,623 and you agree to repay me by giving me $1,000 at the end of each year for 6 years. Obviously you are paying interest. However, our agreement did not specify any interest, nor did it state an interest rate. To find the interest rate that is implicit in this arrangement, you need to carry out what's known as a present value calculation. This can be done through the use of a financial calculator, software, an online calculator, or present value tables. The following format is helpful when using a present value of an ordinary annuity (PVOA) table:

PVOA = PMT x PVOA factor for n=6, i=?
$4,623 = $1,000 x PVOA factor for n=6, i=?
$4,623/$1,000 = PVOA factor for n=6, i=?
4.623 = PVOA factor for n=6, i=?

The PVOA factor of 4.623 appears in the PVOA table in the row where n=6, and where i = 8%. Hence, this loan has an implicit interest rate of 8%.",what
What is the cost of capital?,"Definition of Cost of Capital
The cost of capital is the weighted-average, after-tax cost of a corporation's long-term debt, preferred stock (if any), and the stockholders' equity associated with common stock.
The cost of capital is expressed as a percentage and it is often used to compute the net present value of the cash flows in a proposed investment. It is also considered to be the minimum after-tax internal rate of return to be earned on new investments.
For a profitable U.S. corporation, the costs of bonds and other long-term loans are usually the least expensive components of the cost of capital. One reason is that the interest is deductible for income taxes. For example, a corporation paying 6% on its loans may have an after-tax cost of 4% when its combined federal and state income tax rate is 33%. On the other hand, the dividends paid on the corporation's preferred and common stock are not tax deductible.
The cost of common stock (paid-in capital and retained earnings) is considered to be the most expensive component of the cost of capital because of the risks involved.
Example of Cost of Capital
Assume that a corporation has the following:

$40 million of long-term debt with an after-tax cost of 4%
$10 million of 7% preferred stock
$50 million of common stock and retained earnings with an estimated cost of 15%

The corporation's weighted-average, after-tax cost of capital is:

Long-term debt cost of $1.6 million ($40 million X 4%)
Preferred stock cost of $0.7 million ($10 million X 7%)
Common stock cost of $7.5 million ($50 million X 15%)
Equals a total cost of $9.8 million which divided by $100 million is 9.8%",what
What is a non-discount method in capital budgeting?,"A non-discount method of capital budgeting does not explicitly consider the time value of money. In other words, each dollar earned in the future is assumed to have the same value as each dollar that was invested many years earlier. The payback method is one of the techniques used in capital budgeting that does not consider the time value of money.
The payback method simply computes the number of years it will take for an investment to return cash equal to the amount invested. For example, if an investment of $100,000 is made and it generates cash of $50,000 for two years followed by $10,000 per year for four additional years, its payback is two years ($50,000 + $50,000). If another investment of $100,000 generates cash of $20,000 per year for two years and then provides cash of $40,000 per year for six additional years, its payback is approximately 3.5 years ($20,000 + $20,000 + $40,000 + 0.5 times $40,000).
As you can see in the examples, payback only answers one question: How long before the cash invested is returned? Payback does not address which investment is more profitable. Payback not only ignored the time value of money, it ignored all of the cash received after the payback period.
The accounting rate of return or return on investment (ROI) are two more examples of methods used in capital budgeting that does not involve discounting future cash amounts.
To overcome the shortcomings of payback, accounting rate of return, and return on investment, capital budgeting should include techniques that consider the time value of money. Two of these methods include (1) the net present value method, and (2) the internal rate of return calculation. Under these techniques, the future cash flows are discounted. This means that each dollar in the distant future will be less valuable than each dollar in the near future, and both of these will have less value than each dollar invested in the present.",what
Why would someone buy a bond at a premium?,"A person would buy a bond at a premium (pay more than its maturity value) because the bond's stated interest rate (and therefore its interest payments) are greater than those expected by the current bond market. It is also possible that a bond investor will have no choice. For example, if you wish to purchase a bond maturing in 8 years with a specific bond rating, there might be only one bond available. If its stated interest rate is greater than the market interest rate on the day that you are purchasing, you either buy the bond at a premium or you don't buy a bond.
The bond premium is the present value of both the future interest payments and the maturity amount minus the bond's undiscounted maturity amount. In short, the bond market is very efficient. If a bond's actual interest payments will be greater than the interest payments expected by the market, the bond will sell for more than the bond's maturity amount. If the bond's interest payments will be lower than the interest payments expected by the market, the bond will sell for less than the bond's maturity amount. The difference (premium or discount) is computed by discounting all of the future cash amounts.
Paying a small premium is not unusual. Remember that the premium is directly related to the higher interest amounts you will be receiving. If the bond purchase will result in a large premium, you should investigate whether the bond is callable and its call price. The call price may limit the amount of premium that you are willing to pay.",what
How do I calculate IRR and NPV?,"The internal rate of return (IRR) and the net present value (NPV) are both discounted cash flow techniques or models. This means that each of these techniques looks at two things: 1) the current and future cash inflows and outflows (rather than the accrual accounting income amounts), and 2) the time at which the cash inflows and outflows occur. In other words, these models consider the time value of money: a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in one year, a dollar received in three years is more valuable than a dollar received in five years, and so on.
The internal rate of return or IRR is the rate that will discount all cash inflows and outflows to a net present value of $0. In other words, the IRR model provides you with the true, effective interest rate being earned on a project after taking into consideration the time periods when the various cash amounts are flowing in or out. If you use present value tables to calculate the internal rate of return, it will require some trial and error or iterations to determine the exact rate the project is earning. Software or some financial calculators will provide a quicker and more accurate answer.
The net present value (NPV) discounts all of the cash inflows and outflows by a specified interest rate. The net amount of all of the discounted amounts is the net present value. If the net present value is $0, the project is expected to earn exactly the specified rate. If the net present value is a positive amount, the project will be earning more than the specified interest rate. A negative net present value means the project is expected to earn less than the specified interest rate.",what
What is the time value of money?,"Definition of Time Value of Money
The time value of money recognizes that receiving cash today is more valuable than receiving cash in the future. The reason is that the cash received today can be invested immediately and begin growing in value. For instance, if a company receives $1,000 today and is able to invest the amount immediately at a rate of 10% per year, the company will have $1,100 after 365 days.
If the time value of money is 10%, it also means that receiving $1,100 in one year is comparable to receiving $1,000 today. Accountants will state that the future value of $1,100 has a present value of $1,000. The difference of $100 will become interest income as over the 365 days that the company waits for the cash.
Time Value of Money | Practical Example
Let's assume that a company provides consulting services today and agrees to an $11,000 payment one year later. The $11,000 represents:

an amount for the services performed today, and
interest to compensate the company for waiting 365 days for the $11,000

Under the accrual basis of accounting and a time value of money of 10%, the service revenues that were earned today are $10,000. The difference of $1,000 will be reported as interest income over the 365 days that the company waits for the $11,000.
Importance of the Time Value of Money in Accounting
The time value of money is important in accounting because of the accountant's cost principle and revenue recognition principle. However, the concepts of materiality and cost/benefit allow the accountants to ignore the time value of money for the routine accounts receivable and accounts payable having credit terms of 30 or 60 days.",what
How do you compute the selling price of a bond?,"The selling price or the market value of a bond is the present value of the future cash derived from the bond. In other words, the semiannual interest payments and the payment of the face value of the bond at its maturity date will be discounted by the market interest rate. The resulting present value of those two amounts is the market value.
The semiannual interest payments are considered an annuity, since the bond's stated interest rate and the resulting interest payments do not change even though the market rates are changing each hour. The annuity consisting of the semiannual interest payments will be discounted by the current market interest rate (the rate an investor desires). The lump sum at maturity is a single payment and that too will be discounted by the same market rate used to discount the interest payments. The resulting present value of the lump sum plus the present value of the interest annuity will be the present value and the market value of the bond.
When market interest rates increase, the locked-in or fixed interest payments promised in the bond will become less attractive. Hence the present/market value of the bond will decline as the market demands higher interest payments. If market interest rates decrease, the locked-in or fixed interest payments promised in the bond will become more attractive and will result in a higher present/market value.
One caution for potential investors in bonds: Bonds will likely have a call feature. This means the issuer of the bond has the option to call in the bonds at a specified amount, such as 106% of its face value. This could mean a limit to the upside gain for an investor if interest rates decline. You should discuss this further with your financial adviser.",what
What is the internal rate of return?,"The internal rate of return is the interest rate that will discount an investment's future cash amounts so that the sum of the present values will be equal to cash paid at the beginning of the investment. In capital budgeting, the internal rate of return is also the interest rate that results in an investment having a net present value of zero.
To illustrate, let's assume that a company is considering an investment that will provide net cash inflows of $1,000 at the end of each year for five years. The amount of cash that the company must pay at the beginning of the investment is $3,600. Someone will need to compute the interest rate that will discount the five $1,000 future cash receipts so that their present value at the time of the investment will equal $3,600. Through software or through trial and error, you will find that the internal rate of return on this investment is approximately 12%.
The internal rate of return is one of the tools in capital budgeting that considers the time value of money and also considers all of the cash payments and cash receipts during the life of an investment.",what
What is present value?,"In accounting, present value likely refers to the amount that remains after future cash amounts have been discounted to an earlier time. (The earlier time is depicted on a timeline as the point 0, which is the beginning of period 1.) The discounting process involves removing the time value of money, future interest, etc. which is contained within the future cash amounts.
Accountants will record the present value when neither the cash amount, the cash equivalent amount, nor the fair market value of an item in a transaction is known.
Accountants will also calculate a present value to determine an implicit interest rate or the effective interest rate. For example, if a bond payable with a face value of $100,000 and a stated interest rate of 8% is issued for $99,000 the accountant will seek the interest rate which will discount the future semiannual interest amounts of $40,000 and the maturity value of $100,000 to be exactly $99,000 at the time that the bonds were issued. That rate is the effective interest rate and it will be used to determine each period's interest expense and the amount of the discount on bonds payable to be amortized in each period.",what
Should capital budgeting decisions be based on cash flows or revenues and expenses?,"Capital budgeting decisions should be based on cash flows that are adjusted for the time value of money. The time value of money recognizes that a dollar received or spent in the future is less valuable than a dollar received or spent in the present. Calculations such as the internal rate of return, net present value, and excess present value include adjustments for the time value of money. In these calculations present value factors, financial calculators, or computer software are used to discount the cash flows to their present values.
Under accrual accounting, revenues and expenses are reported based on accounting principles. This means that revenues are reported when they are earned, and expenses are matched to the periods of the revenue. In other words, revenues and expenses are not reported on the income statement when the money is received or spent. Further, the revenue and expense amounts are not adjusted for the time value of money because of the monetary unit assumption.",what
How do you calculate the actual or real interest rate on a bond investment?,"The actual or real interest rate on a bond can be calculated by using present value software or a financial calculator. The actual, real, or effective interest rate is the rate that will discount all of the future cash receipts back to the amount of cash paid to buy the bond. This interest rate is also known as the yield to maturity, yield, and market interest rate.
The future cash receipts for a typical bond are the semiannual interest payments (interest rate stated on the bond X face amount of bond X 1/2 year) and the maturity amount of the bond. The interest payments form an ordinary annuity and the maturity amount is a single payment.
If the bond's stated interest rate is less than the current market interest rate, the bond's market value is less than the maturity or face amount of the bond. In financial jargon, the bond will sell at a discount.
If the bond's interest rate is more than the current market interest rate, the bond will have a market value that is more than the maturity or face amount of the bond. In other words, the bond will sell at a premium.",what
What is net present value?,"Net present value is the combination of the present value of an investment's cash inflows and the present value of the investment's cash outflows. To compute those present value amounts, the future cash flows are discounted by a specified rate. The specified rate could be the investor's cost of capital or it could be some other minimum rate that must be earned.
The advantages of using the net present value to evaluate investments are 1) all of the investment's cash flows are used in the calculation, and 2) the time value of money is considered because the future cash amounts are discounted to the present.
A project or investment that results in a net present value of $0 means that the project is expected to earn exactly the specified rate that was used in discounting the future cash flows. A slightly negative net present value indicates that the project will earn slightly less than the specified rate. For instance, if the specified rate of 16% was used for discounting the cash flows, a slightly negative net present value could mean that the project is expected to earn 15.7%. (Hence, a project could earn a very respectable profit but have a negative net present value because it just missed achieving the specified rate.)
To find the exact rate that a project is expected to earn, the project's cash flows can be used to compute the internal rate of return, which is another discounted cash flow technique for evaluating investments.",what
What is DCF?,"In accounting, DCF refers to discounted cash flows or to the discounted cash flow techniques such as net present value or internal rate of return.
DCF is a preferred method for evaluating capital expenditures (and other investments) because DCF recognizes the time value of money. In other words, it recognizes that receiving $10,000 of cash today is more valuable than receiving $10,000 of cash in the future. Similarly, $10,000 cash receipt in Year 10 is less valuable than a $10,000 cash receipt in Year 7.
The recognition of the time value of money occurs by discounting the related future cash flows back to the time when cash is invested. (The date that the cash is invested is often referred to as the ""present"" or the very beginning of the investment's first year.)
The greater the time value of money, the greater will be the amount of the discount. The smaller the time value of money, the smaller the amount of the discount. In turn, a larger discount will mean a smaller present value. A smaller discount will result in a greater present value.
DCF is also useful for calculating the approximate market value of bonds payable, a product line, or entire companies.",what
What is the discounted value of expected net receipts?,"Let's first define expected net receipts. These are future receipts after deducting any related payments. For example, if you are likely to receive $1,200 one year from today, but will have to pay a fee of $200 at the time of the receipts, the expected net receipts will be $1,000.
Often we need to know the present value of amounts expected in the future. We calculate the present value by discounting the future amounts. In this situation discounting means 1) removing a specified amount of interest, or 2) adjusting for the time value of money. The concept is that receiving $1,000 in the future is less valuable than receiving $1,000 today.
If we assume that the time value of money is 10% per year, a net receipt of $1,000 one year from today will have a present value of $909. In other words, we discounted the future value of $1,000 by $91. With a time value of money of 10%, the $909 can be invested today and will grow by $91 ($909 x 10%) to be $1,000 in one year. Receiving a net amount of $1,000 in two years will have a present value of only $826. The reason is that $826 invested today at a compounded rate of 10% will grow to $1,000 in two years. If all amounts are certain, you will be in the same position whether you have $826 today or you receive $1,000 in two years.",what
Should a company focus on cash flows or accounting profits when making a capital expenditure decision?,"Using the incremental cash flows and discounting them to reflect the time value of money is the preferred method. The two most common techniques involved in discounting cash flows are net present value and internal rate of return.
While the discounted cash flow models are the ideal, I would also want to forecast or project the impact on the company's future financial statements. Therefore, I would also calculate and understand the effect on the accounting profits resulting from the capital expenditure.",what
What does per annum mean?,"Definition of Per Annum
Per annum means yearly or annually. It is a common phrase used to describe an interest rate. Often ""per annum"" is omitted, as in ""I have a 4% mortgage loan."" or ""This bond pays interest of 6%.""

The $522,000 of present value coming in minus the $500,000 of present value going out results is a positive net present value of $22,000. In other words, the company will earn slightly more than 14% per year on its $500,000 investment.",what
What is the effective interest rate?,"Definition of Effective Interest Rate
The effective interest rate is the true rate of interest earned. It can also mean the market interest rate, the yield to maturity, the discount rate, the internal rate of return, the annual percentage rate (APR), and the targeted or required interest rate.
Example of the Effective Interest Rate
Assume that a corporation issues a $1,000 bond with a stated, contractual, face, or nominal interest rate of 5%. This means that the corporation will pay exactly $50 per year during the life of the bond plus the principal amount at maturity. Let's also assume that after the bonds are issued the market interest rates increase by one percentage point. As a result the 5% bond will lose some of its value because the contractual payment of $50 per year is not worth $1,000 when the market is paying $60 per year for a similar $1,000 bond. An investor will purchase the 5% bond only if the cost is low enough to yield 6% over the remaining life of the bond. In other words, the investor will pay less than the $1,000 so that the effective interest rate for the remaining life of the bond will be 6%.",what
What is the difference between Present Value (PV) and Net Present Value (NPV)?,"Definition of Present Value (PV)
Present value or PV is the result of discounting one or more future amounts to the present. The greater the discount rate, the smaller the present value.

A negative net present value indicates an investment is earning less than the discount rate, but may be earning a positive rate. For example, if the cash flows are discounted by 12%, a slightly negative NPV could mean that the investment is earning 11%. 
Examples of Net Present Value
Assume that an investment of $5,000 today will result in one cash receipt of $10,000 at the end of 5 years.

What is an implicit interest rate?,"Definition of Implicit Interest Rate
An implicit interest rate is one that is not stated explicitly.
Example of Implicit Interest Rate
Assume that I lend you $4,623 and you agree to repay me by giving me $1,000 at the end of each year for 6 years. Obviously you are paying interest. However, our agreement did not specify any interest, nor did it state an interest rate. To find the interest rate that is implicit in this arrangement, you need to carry out what's known as a present value calculation. This can be done through the use of a financial calculator, software, an online calculator, or present value tables. The following format is helpful when using a present value of an ordinary annuity (PVOA) table:

PVOA = PMT x PVOA factor for n=6, i=?
$4,623 = $1,000 x PVOA factor for n=6, i=?
$4,623/$1,000 = PVOA factor for n=6, i=?
4.623 = PVOA factor for n=6, i=?

The PVOA factor of 4.623 appears in the PVOA table in the row where n=6, and where i = 8%. Hence, this loan has an implicit interest rate of 8%.",what
What is the cost of capital?,"Definition of Cost of Capital
The cost of capital is the weighted-average, after-tax cost of a corporation's long-term debt, preferred stock (if any), and the stockholders' equity associated with common stock.
The cost of capital is expressed as a percentage and it is often used to compute the net present value of the cash flows in a proposed investment. It is also considered to be the minimum after-tax internal rate of return to be earned on new investments.
For a profitable U.S. corporation, the costs of bonds and other long-term loans are usually the least expensive components of the cost of capital. One reason is that the interest is deductible for income taxes. For example, a corporation paying 6% on its loans may have an after-tax cost of 4% when its combined federal and state income tax rate is 33%. On the other hand, the dividends paid on the corporation's preferred and common stock are not tax deductible.
The cost of common stock (paid-in capital and retained earnings) is considered to be the most expensive component of the cost of capital because of the risks involved.
Example of Cost of Capital
Assume that a corporation has the following:

$40 million of long-term debt with an after-tax cost of 4%
$10 million of 7% preferred stock
$50 million of common stock and retained earnings with an estimated cost of 15%

The corporation's weighted-average, after-tax cost of capital is:

Long-term debt cost of $1.6 million ($40 million X 4%)
Preferred stock cost of $0.7 million ($10 million X 7%)
Common stock cost of $7.5 million ($50 million X 15%)
Equals a total cost of $9.8 million which divided by $100 million is 9.8%",what
What is a non-discount method in capital budgeting?,"A non-discount method of capital budgeting does not explicitly consider the time value of money. In other words, each dollar earned in the future is assumed to have the same value as each dollar that was invested many years earlier. The payback method is one of the techniques used in capital budgeting that does not consider the time value of money.
The payback method simply computes the number of years it will take for an investment to return cash equal to the amount invested. For example, if an investment of $100,000 is made and it generates cash of $50,000 for two years followed by $10,000 per year for four additional years, its payback is two years ($50,000 + $50,000). If another investment of $100,000 generates cash of $20,000 per year for two years and then provides cash of $40,000 per year for six additional years, its payback is approximately 3.5 years ($20,000 + $20,000 + $40,000 + 0.5 times $40,000).
As you can see in the examples, payback only answers one question: How long before the cash invested is returned? Payback does not address which investment is more profitable. Payback not only ignored the time value of money, it ignored all of the cash received after the payback period.
The accounting rate of return or return on investment (ROI) are two more examples of methods used in capital budgeting that does not involve discounting future cash amounts.
To overcome the shortcomings of payback, accounting rate of return, and return on investment, capital budgeting should include techniques that consider the time value of money. Two of these methods include (1) the net present value method, and (2) the internal rate of return calculation. Under these techniques, the future cash flows are discounted. This means that each dollar in the distant future will be less valuable than each dollar in the near future, and both of these will have less value than each dollar invested in the present.",what
Why would someone buy a bond at a premium?,"A person would buy a bond at a premium (pay more than its maturity value) because the bond's stated interest rate (and therefore its interest payments) are greater than those expected by the current bond market. It is also possible that a bond investor will have no choice. For example, if you wish to purchase a bond maturing in 8 years with a specific bond rating, there might be only one bond available. If its stated interest rate is greater than the market interest rate on the day that you are purchasing, you either buy the bond at a premium or you don't buy a bond.
The bond premium is the present value of both the future interest payments and the maturity amount minus the bond's undiscounted maturity amount. In short, the bond market is very efficient. If a bond's actual interest payments will be greater than the interest payments expected by the market, the bond will sell for more than the bond's maturity amount. If the bond's interest payments will be lower than the interest payments expected by the market, the bond will sell for less than the bond's maturity amount. The difference (premium or discount) is computed by discounting all of the future cash amounts.
Paying a small premium is not unusual. Remember that the premium is directly related to the higher interest amounts you will be receiving. If the bond purchase will result in a large premium, you should investigate whether the bond is callable and its call price. The call price may limit the amount of premium that you are willing to pay.",what
How do I calculate IRR and NPV?,"The internal rate of return (IRR) and the net present value (NPV) are both discounted cash flow techniques or models. This means that each of these techniques looks at two things: 1) the current and future cash inflows and outflows (rather than the accrual accounting income amounts), and 2) the time at which the cash inflows and outflows occur. In other words, these models consider the time value of money: a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in one year, a dollar received in three years is more valuable than a dollar received in five years, and so on.
The internal rate of return or IRR is the rate that will discount all cash inflows and outflows to a net present value of $0. In other words, the IRR model provides you with the true, effective interest rate being earned on a project after taking into consideration the time periods when the various cash amounts are flowing in or out. If you use present value tables to calculate the internal rate of return, it will require some trial and error or iterations to determine the exact rate the project is earning. Software or some financial calculators will provide a quicker and more accurate answer.
The net present value (NPV) discounts all of the cash inflows and outflows by a specified interest rate. The net amount of all of the discounted amounts is the net present value. If the net present value is $0, the project is expected to earn exactly the specified rate. If the net present value is a positive amount, the project will be earning more than the specified interest rate. A negative net present value means the project is expected to earn less than the specified interest rate.",what
How do you compute the selling price of a bond?,"The selling price or the market value of a bond is the present value of the future cash derived from the bond. In other words, the semiannual interest payments and the payment of the face value of the bond at its maturity date will be discounted by the market interest rate. The resulting present value of those two amounts is the market value.
The semiannual interest payments are considered an annuity, since the bond's stated interest rate and the resulting interest payments do not change even though the market rates are changing each hour. The annuity consisting of the semiannual interest payments will be discounted by the current market interest rate (the rate an investor desires). The lump sum at maturity is a single payment and that too will be discounted by the same market rate used to discount the interest payments. The resulting present value of the lump sum plus the present value of the interest annuity will be the present value and the market value of the bond.
When market interest rates increase, the locked-in or fixed interest payments promised in the bond will become less attractive. Hence the present/market value of the bond will decline as the market demands higher interest payments. If market interest rates decrease, the locked-in or fixed interest payments promised in the bond will become more attractive and will result in a higher present/market value.
One caution for potential investors in bonds: Bonds will likely have a call feature. This means the issuer of the bond has the option to call in the bonds at a specified amount, such as 106% of its face value. This could mean a limit to the upside gain for an investor if interest rates decline. You should discuss this further with your financial adviser.",what
What is the internal rate of return?,"The internal rate of return is the interest rate that will discount an investment's future cash amounts so that the sum of the present values will be equal to cash paid at the beginning of the investment. In capital budgeting, the internal rate of return is also the interest rate that results in an investment having a net present value of zero.
To illustrate, let's assume that a company is considering an investment that will provide net cash inflows of $1,000 at the end of each year for five years. The amount of cash that the company must pay at the beginning of the investment is $3,600. Someone will need to compute the interest rate that will discount the five $1,000 future cash receipts so that their present value at the time of the investment will equal $3,600. Through software or through trial and error, you will find that the internal rate of return on this investment is approximately 12%.
The internal rate of return is one of the tools in capital budgeting that considers the time value of money and also considers all of the cash payments and cash receipts during the life of an investment.",what
What is present value?,"In accounting, present value likely refers to the amount that remains after future cash amounts have been discounted to an earlier time. (The earlier time is depicted on a timeline as the point 0, which is the beginning of period 1.) The discounting process involves removing the time value of money, future interest, etc. which is contained within the future cash amounts.
Accountants will record the present value when neither the cash amount, the cash equivalent amount, nor the fair market value of an item in a transaction is known.
Accountants will also calculate a present value to determine an implicit interest rate or the effective interest rate. For example, if a bond payable with a face value of $100,000 and a stated interest rate of 8% is issued for $99,000 the accountant will seek the interest rate which will discount the future semiannual interest amounts of $40,000 and the maturity value of $100,000 to be exactly $99,000 at the time that the bonds were issued. That rate is the effective interest rate and it will be used to determine each period's interest expense and the amount of the discount on bonds payable to be amortized in each period.",what
Should capital budgeting decisions be based on cash flows or revenues and expenses?,"Capital budgeting decisions should be based on cash flows that are adjusted for the time value of money. The time value of money recognizes that a dollar received or spent in the future is less valuable than a dollar received or spent in the present. Calculations such as the internal rate of return, net present value, and excess present value include adjustments for the time value of money. In these calculations present value factors, financial calculators, or computer software are used to discount the cash flows to their present values.
Under accrual accounting, revenues and expenses are reported based on accounting principles. This means that revenues are reported when they are earned, and expenses are matched to the periods of the revenue. In other words, revenues and expenses are not reported on the income statement when the money is received or spent. Further, the revenue and expense amounts are not adjusted for the time value of money because of the monetary unit assumption.",what
How do you calculate the actual or real interest rate on a bond investment?,"The actual or real interest rate on a bond can be calculated by using present value software or a financial calculator. The actual, real, or effective interest rate is the rate that will discount all of the future cash receipts back to the amount of cash paid to buy the bond. This interest rate is also known as the yield to maturity, yield, and market interest rate.
The future cash receipts for a typical bond are the semiannual interest payments (interest rate stated on the bond X face amount of bond X 1/2 year) and the maturity amount of the bond. The interest payments form an ordinary annuity and the maturity amount is a single payment.
If the bond's stated interest rate is less than the current market interest rate, the bond's market value is less than the maturity or face amount of the bond. In financial jargon, the bond will sell at a discount.
If the bond's interest rate is more than the current market interest rate, the bond will have a market value that is more than the maturity or face amount of the bond. In other words, the bond will sell at a premium.",what
What is net present value?,"Net present value is the combination of the present value of an investment's cash inflows and the present value of the investment's cash outflows. To compute those present value amounts, the future cash flows are discounted by a specified rate. The specified rate could be the investor's cost of capital or it could be some other minimum rate that must be earned.
The advantages of using the net present value to evaluate investments are 1) all of the investment's cash flows are used in the calculation, and 2) the time value of money is considered because the future cash amounts are discounted to the present.
A project or investment that results in a net present value of $0 means that the project is expected to earn exactly the specified rate that was used in discounting the future cash flows. A slightly negative net present value indicates that the project will earn slightly less than the specified rate. For instance, if the specified rate of 16% was used for discounting the cash flows, a slightly negative net present value could mean that the project is expected to earn 15.7%. (Hence, a project could earn a very respectable profit but have a negative net present value because it just missed achieving the specified rate.)
To find the exact rate that a project is expected to earn, the project's cash flows can be used to compute the internal rate of return, which is another discounted cash flow technique for evaluating investments.",what
What is DCF?,"In accounting, DCF refers to discounted cash flows or to the discounted cash flow techniques such as net present value or internal rate of return.
DCF is a preferred method for evaluating capital expenditures (and other investments) because DCF recognizes the time value of money. In other words, it recognizes that receiving $10,000 of cash today is more valuable than receiving $10,000 of cash in the future. Similarly, $10,000 cash receipt in Year 10 is less valuable than a $10,000 cash receipt in Year 7.
The recognition of the time value of money occurs by discounting the related future cash flows back to the time when cash is invested. (The date that the cash is invested is often referred to as the ""present"" or the very beginning of the investment's first year.)
The greater the time value of money, the greater will be the amount of the discount. The smaller the time value of money, the smaller the amount of the discount. In turn, a larger discount will mean a smaller present value. A smaller discount will result in a greater present value.
DCF is also useful for calculating the approximate market value of bonds payable, a product line, or entire companies.",what
What is an annuity in present value calculations?,"In present value calculations, an annuity is a series of equal cash amounts occurring at equal time intervals. The identical cash amounts are sometimes referred to as payments, receipts, or rent.
Some examples of business transactions that form an annuity include:

The equal amounts of interest paid every six months by the issuer of debt securities known as bonds.
The monthly payments required by a lease agreement for equipment or a vehicle.
The annual payments required by a purchase agreement.

The annuity payments are often discounted to arrive at their present value. The annuity payments can also be used to determine the effective interest rate that is embedded in an agreement.
Depending on the starting point of the first payment, an annuity will be further identified as an ordinary annuity, an annuity in advance, a deferred annuity, etc.",what
What is the discounted value of expected net receipts?,"Let's first define expected net receipts. These are future receipts after deducting any related payments. For example, if you are likely to receive $1,200 one year from today, but will have to pay a fee of $200 at the time of the receipts, the expected net receipts will be $1,000.
Often we need to know the present value of amounts expected in the future. We calculate the present value by discounting the future amounts. In this situation discounting means 1) removing a specified amount of interest, or 2) adjusting for the time value of money. The concept is that receiving $1,000 in the future is less valuable than receiving $1,000 today.
If we assume that the time value of money is 10% per year, a net receipt of $1,000 one year from today will have a present value of $909. In other words, we discounted the future value of $1,000 by $91. With a time value of money of 10%, the $909 can be invested today and will grow by $91 ($909 x 10%) to be $1,000 in one year. Receiving a net amount of $1,000 in two years will have a present value of only $826. The reason is that $826 invested today at a compounded rate of 10% will grow to $1,000 in two years. If all amounts are certain, you will be in the same position whether you have $826 today or you receive $1,000 in two years.",what
Should a company focus on cash flows or accounting profits when making a capital expenditure decision?,"Using the incremental cash flows and discounting them to reflect the time value of money is the preferred method. The two most common techniques involved in discounting cash flows are net present value and internal rate of return.
While the discounted cash flow models are the ideal, I would also want to forecast or project the impact on the company's future financial statements. Therefore, I would also calculate and understand the effect on the accounting profits resulting from the capital expenditure.",what
What is a flexible budget?,"Definition of a Flexible Budget
A flexible budget is a budget that adjusts or flexes with changes in volume or activity. The flexible budget is more sophisticated and useful than a static budget. (The static budget amounts do not change. They remain unchanged from the amounts established at the time that the static budget was prepared and approved.)
For costs that vary with volume or activity, the flexible budget will flex because the budget will include a variable rate per unit of activity instead of one fixed total amount. In short, the flexible budget is a more useful tool when measuring a manager's efficiency.
Example of a Flexible Budget
Let's assume a company determines that its cost of electricity and supplies will vary by approximately $10 for each machine hour (MH) used. It also knows that other costs are fixed costs of approximately $40,000 per month. Typically, the machine hours are between 4,000 and 7,000 hours per month. Based on this information, the flexible budget for each month would be $40,000 + $10 per MH.
Now let's illustrate the flexible budget by using different levels of volume. If 5,000 machine hours were necessary for the month of January, the flexible budget for January will be $90,000 ($40,000 fixed + $10 x 5,000 MH). If the machine hours in February are 6,300 hours, then the flexible budget for February will be $103,000 ($40,000 fixed + $10 x 6,300 MH). If March has 4,100 machine hours, the flexible budget for March will be $81,000 ($40,000 fixed + $10 x 4,100 MH).",what
What is absorption costing?,"Definition of Absorption Costing
Absorption costing (or full absorption costing) indicates that all of the manufacturing costs have been assigned to (or absorbed by) the units produced. In other words, the cost of a finished product will include the costs of:

direct materials
direct labor
variable manufacturing overhead
fixed manufacturing overhead

Absorption costing is required for external financial reporting and for income tax reporting.
Another method of costing (known a direct costing or variable costing) does not assign the fixed manufacturing overhead costs to products.
Standard Costing: Fixed Manufacturing Overhead Variances
Standard Costing: Variable Manufacturing Overhead Variances",what
What is cost accounting?,"Definition of Cost Accounting
Cost accounting is involved with the following:

Determining the costs of products, processes, projects, etc. in order to report the correct amounts on a company's financial statements, and
Assisting management in the planning and control of the organization
Preparing special analyses that assists in making the best decisions

Examples of Cost Accounting
A significant part of cost accounting involves the unit cost of a manufacturer's products in order to report the cost of inventory on its balance sheet and the cost of goods sold on its income statement. This is achieved with techniques such as the allocation of manufacturing overhead costs and through the use of process costing, operations costing, and job-order costing systems.
Cost accounting assists management to plan and control the business through budgeting for operations, capital budgeting for expanding operations, standard costing and the reporting of variances, transfer pricing, etc.
Special analyses includes cost behavior, cost-volume-profit relationships, make or buy decisions, selling prices for products, activity-based costing, and more.
Cost accounting had its roots in manufacturing businesses. However, today it extends to service businesses. For example, a bank will use cost accounting to determine the cost of processing a customer's check and/or a deposit, maintaining a checking account, processing international wire transfers, servicing a mortgage loan, etc. This in turn may provide management with guidance in the pricing of various services.",what
What is job order costing?,"Definition of Job Order Costing
Job order costing or job costing is a system for assigning and accumulating manufacturing costs of an individual unit of output. The job order costing system is used when the various items produced are sufficiently different from each other and each has a significant cost. (When a company's output consists of continuous flows of identical, low-cost units, the process costing system is more appropriate.)
Since there is a significant variation in the items manufactured, the job order costing system requires a separate job cost record for each item (or each job or special order). The job cost record will report each item's direct materials and direct labor that were actually used and an assigned amount of manufacturing overhead.
The job cost records also serve as the subsidiary ledger or documentation for the manufacturer's cost of the work-in-process inventory, the finished goods inventory, and the cost of goods sold.
Examples of Job Order Costing
A few examples of the use of job order costing are:

A company that designs and produces custom-made machines and/or machine tooling
A company that constructs custom-designed buildings
A company that modifies trucks to meet customers' special needs",what
What is the difference between actual overhead and applied overhead?,"Definition of Actual Overhead
In the context of actual and applied overhead, actual overhead refers to a manufacturer's indirect manufacturing costs. (Costs that are outside of the manufacturing operations, such as marketing and general management, are expenses of the accounting period and are not applied or assigned to products.)
Actual overhead are the manufacturing costs other than direct materials and direct labor. Since the overhead costs are not directly traceable to products, the overhead costs must be allocated, assigned, or applied to goods produced.
Examples of Actual Overhead
A few of the many overhead costs are:

Electricity used to power the production equipment
Natural gas to heat the production facilities
Depreciation of the production equipment and facilities
Normal repairs and maintenance of the production equipment
Salaries and benefits for production supervisors

These actual costs will be recorded in general ledger accounts as the costs are incurred.
Definition of Applied Overhead
Applied overhead is the amount of the manufacturing overhead that is assigned to the goods produced. This is usually done by using a predetermined annual overhead rate.
Example of Applied Overhead
Let's assume that a company expects to have $800,000 of overhead costs in the upcoming year. It also expects that it will have its normal 16,000 of production machine hours during the upcoming year. As a result, the company will apply, allocate, or assign overhead to the goods manufactured using a predetermined overhead rate of $50 ($800,000 divided by 16,000) for every production machine hour used.
Since the future overhead costs and future number of machine hours were not known with certainty, and since the actual machine hours will not occur uniformly throughout the year, there will always be a difference between the actual overhead costs incurred and the amount of overhead applied to the manufactured goods. Hopefully, the differences will be not be significant at the end of the accounting year.",what
What are manufacturing costs?,"Definition of Manufacturing Costs
Manufacturing costs are the costs of materials plus the costs to convert the materials into products. All manufacturing costs must be assigned to the units produced in order for a company's external financial statements to comply with U.S. GAAP.
The resulting unit costs are used for inventory valuation and for the calculation of the cost of goods sold.
Example of Manufacturing Costs
Manufacturing costs are typically divided into three categories: 

Direct materials, which is the cost of the materials that are traceable to the product, such as the aluminum in beverage cans
Direct labor , which are the wages and fringe benefits earned by the individuals who are physically involved in converting raw materials into a finished product
Manufacturing overhead, which includes all of the other costs incurred in the manufacturing activities. These indirect costs include repairs and maintenance, depreciation of the manufacturing equipment, utilities, salaries of manufacturing supervisors, etc.",what
What are direct costs?,"Definition of Direct Costs
Direct costs are directly traceable to a cost object such as a product or a department. In other words, direct costs do not have to be allocated to a product, department, or other cost object. (A cost that must be allocated to a product, department, or other cost object is an indirect cost.)
Examples of Direct Costs
Assume that a company produces artisan furniture. The following are direct product costs and they are direct production department costs:

The cost of the wood
The cost of the craftsperson working on the furniture

The other costs of producing the furniture are indirect product costs, since they must be allocated to the furniture based on labor hours, machine hours, or some other activities. However, the indirect product costs could be direct production department costs.",what
What is variance analysis?,"Definition of Variance Analysis
In accounting, a variance is the difference between an actual amount and a budgeted, planned or past amount. Variance analysis is one step in the process of identifying and explaining the reasons for different outcomes.
Variance analysis is usually associated with a manufacturer's product costs. In this setting, variance analysis attempts to identify the causes of the differences between a manufacturer's 1) standard or planned costs of the inputs that should have occurred for the actual products manufactured, and 2) the actual costs of the inputs used for the actual products manufactured.
Example of Variance Analysis
Assume that a company manufactured 10,000 units of product (output). The company's standards indicate that it should have used $40,000 of materials (an input), but it actually used $48,000 of materials. The variance analysis may include the following:

There is an $8,000 unfavorable variance which needs to be analyzed
The $8,000 variance can be separated into a price variance and a quantity variance
The price variance identifies whether the actual cost per pound of the input was more or less than the planned or standard cost per pound
The quantity variance identifies whether the actual quantity of the input used was more or less than the planned or standard quantity for the actual output

The variance analysis of manufacturing overhead costs is more complicated than the variance analysis for materials. However, the variance analysis of manufacturing overhead costs is important since these costs have become a large percentage of manufacturing costs.",what
What is the difference between normal costing and standard costing?,"Definition of Normal Costing
Normal costing for manufactured products consists of following:

Actual cost of materials
Actual cost of direct labor
Applied manufacturing overhead cost based on a predetermined manufacturing overhead rate

The three product costs are used for calculating the cost of goods sold and the cost of the various inventories.
If there is a difference between the total amount of overhead costs applied to the products and the total amount of actual overhead costs incurred, the difference is referred to as a variance. If the amount of the variance is not significant, it will usually be assigned to the cost of goods sold. If the variance is significant, it should be prorated to the cost of goods sold, the work-in-process inventory, and the finished goods inventory based on their amounts of applied overhead.
Definition of Standard Costing
Standard costing for manufactured products consists of the following:

Predetermined materials costs
Predetermined direct labor costs
Predetermined manufacturing overhead costs

These standard costs are used to calculate the manufacturer's cost of goods sold and inventories.
If the actual costs vary only slightly from the standard costs, the resulting variances will be assigned to the cost of goods sold. If the variances are significant, they should be prorated to the cost of goods sold and to various inventories based on their amounts of the standard costs.",what
What is standard costing?,"Definition of Standard Costing
Standard costing is an accounting system used by some manufacturers to identify the differences or variances between:

The actual costs of the goods that were produced, and
The costs that should have occurred for the actual goods produced

The costs that should have occurred for the actual good output are known as standard costs, which are likely integrated with a manufacturer's  budgets, profit plan, master budget, etc. The standard costs involve the product costs, namely, direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead.
With standard costing, the general ledger accounts for inventories and the cost of goods sold contain the standard costs of the inputs that should have been used to make the actual good output. Differences between the actual costs and the standard costs will appear as variances, which can be investigated. 
If the company spends more for the direct materials, direct labor, and/or manufacturing overhead than should have been spent, the company will not meet its projected net income. In other words, analysis of variances will direct management's attention to the production inefficiencies or higher input costs. In turn, management can take action to correct the problems, seek higher selling prices, etc.
Since the company's external financial statements must reflect the historical cost principle, the standard costs in the inventories and the cost of goods sold will need to be adjusted for the variances. Since most of the goods manufactured will have been sold, most of the variances will end up as part of the cost of goods sold.",what
What is managerial accounting?,"Definition of Managerial Accounting
Managerial accounting is also known as management accounting and it includes many of the topics that are included in cost accounting.
Some of the managerial topics involve the computation of a manufacturer's product costs that are needed for the external financial statements which must comply with US GAAP. Other topics involve analyses and reports that are not distributed outside of the company but are used by management in its decision making and in the planning and control of the business operations.
Examples of Managerial Accounting Topics
Managerial accounting topics often include:

Job order costing
Process costing
Absorption costing vs. variable costing
Understanding cost behavior and cost-volume-profit analysis
Operational budgeting
Standard costing and variance analysis
Activity based costing
Pricing of individual products and services
Analyzing the profitability of product lines, customers, territories, etc.
Capital budgeting
Ratio analysis",what
What is a standard cost?,"Definition of Standard Cost
A standard cost is described as a predetermined cost, an estimated future cost, an expected cost, a budgeted unit cost, a forecast cost, or as the ""should be"" cost. Standard costs are often an integral part of a manufacturer's annual profit plan and operating budgets.
When standard costs are used in a manufacturing setting, a product's standard cost for a future accounting period will consist of the following:

Direct materials: a standard quantity of each material and a standard cost per unit of material
Direct labor: a standard quantity of labor and a standard cost per hour of labor
Manufacturing overhead: a budget for the fixed overhead, the standard variable overhead rate, and the standard quantity for applying a fixed and variable overhead rates

In a standard costing system, the standard costs of the manufacturing activities will be recorded in the inventories and the cost of goods sold accounts. Since the company must pay its vendors and production workers the actual costs incurred, there are likely to be some differences. The differences between the standard costs and the actual manufacturing costs are referred to as  cost variances  and will be recorded in separate variance accounts. Any balance in a variance account indicates that the company is deviating from the amounts in its profit plan.
While standard costs can be a useful management tool for a manufacturer, the manufacturer's external financial statements must comply with the cost principle and the matching principle. Therefore, significant variances must be reviewed and properly assigned or allocated to the cost of goods sold and/or inventories.
AccountingCoach PRO includes forms to assist in a better understanding of standard costs and their related variances.",what
What are indirect manufacturing costs?,"Definition of Indirect Manufacturing Costs
Indirect manufacturing costs are a manufacturer's production costs other than direct materials and direct labor. Indirect manufacturing costs are also referred to as manufacturing overhead, factory overhead, factory burden, or burden.
US GAAP requires that indirect manufacturing costs be allocated to, assigned to, or absorbed by the manufacturer's output (in addition to the cost of direct materials and direct labor) for its external financial statements. This is known as absorption costing and must be used in determining a manufacturer's cost of goods sold and the cost of its inventory.
In traditional cost accounting, the indirect manufacturing costs are allocated to the products manufactured based on direct labor hours, direct labor costs, or production machine hours. However, in recent decades the indirect manufacturing costs have increased significantly and are less likely to be caused by the quantity of direct labor or production machine hours. (This may not be a problem for financial reporting when the amount of inventory is consistently small, but it can be a problem for pricing and other decisions.)
Examples of Indirect Manufacturing Costs
Some examples of indirect manufacturing costs include:

depreciation, repairs and maintenance, electricity, etc. for the production facilities and the production equipment
salaries, wages and fringe benefits of the indirect manufacturing personnel such as production supervisors, material handlers, quality assurance, and other factory support personnel
factory supplies, outside services pertaining to manufacturing, and other manufacturing related costs",what
What do negative variances indicate?,"Definition of Negative Variances on Accounting Reports
Negative variances are the unfavorable differences between two amounts, such as:

The amount by which actual revenues were less than the budgeted revenues
The amount by which actual expenses were greater than the budgeted expenses
The amount by which actual net income was less than the budgeted net income
The amount by which current revenues were less than the previous year's revenues
The amount by which actual expenses were greater than the previous year's expenses
The amount by which the actual net income was less than the budgeted net income

The negative variances, which are unfavorable in terms of a company's profits, are usually presented in parentheses. On the other hand, positive variances in terms of a company's profits are presented without parentheses.
Examples of Negative Variances on Accounting Reports
Assume that a company had the following following information for a recent month:

Budgeted revenues of $30,000
Budgeted expenses of $22,000
Budgeted net income of $8,000
Actual revenues of $28,500
Actual expenses of $20,800
Actual net income of $7,700

Based on the above information, the company's will be reported as shown here:

Revenues variance: ($1,500). The amount is a negative or unfavorable variance because the actual revenues were $28,500 instead of the budgeted revenues of $30,000. The difference of $1,500 is unfavorable for the company's profitability.
Expenses variance: $1,200. The amount is a positive or favorable variance because the actual expenses of $20,800 are less than the budgeted expenses of $22,000. The difference of $1,200 is favorable for the company's profitability.
Net income variance: ($300). The amount is a negative or unfavorable variance because the actual net income of $7,700 is less than the budgeted net income of $8,000. The difference of ($300) is an unfavorable outcome for the company. The amount also agrees with the combination of the unfavorable revenues variance of ($1,500) and the positive expenses variance of $1,200.

To assist the readers of the accounting reports with variances being reported to indicate on the report: ""( ) = an unfavorable effect on net income.""",what
What is direct labor?,"Definition of Direct Labor
Direct labor refers to the employees and temporary staff who work directly on a manufacturer's products. (People working in the production area, but not directly on the products, are referred to as indirect labor.)
The direct labor cost includes the wages and fringe benefits of the direct labor employees and the cost of the temporary staff that are working directly on the manufacturer's products.
The direct labor cost is classified as the following:

A product cost (along with the costs of the direct materials and manufacturing overhead)
An inventoriable cost (along with the costs of the direct materials and manufacturing overhead)
A prime cost (along with direct materials)
A conversion cost (along with manufacturing overhead)",what
What is relevant range?,"Definition of Relevant Range
In accounting, the term relevant range usually refers to a normal range of volume or normal amount of activity in which the total amount of a company's fixed costs will not change as the volume or amount of activity changes. The term relevant range is included in the definition of fixed costs, because if a company's volume were to decline to an extremely low level, the company would take action to decrease its total amount of fixed costs. Similarly, if the company's volume were to increase dramatically, the company would likely have to increase the total amount of its fixed costs . 
Example of Relevant Range
Let's assume that a manufacturer's monthly production volume is consistently between 10,000 to 13,000 units of product requiring between 20,000 to 25,000 machine hours. Within these ranges of activity, the manufacturing operations run smoothly with the same amount of monthly fixed costs, which on average are approximately $200,000 per month for the cost of supervisors, rent, depreciation, and other fixed costs.
However, if the manufacturer's volume were to drop to say 7,000 units of product and/or to 14,000 machine hours, it would likely reduce the number of its supervisors, the space it rents, and some other fixed costs in order to reduce the $200,000 of monthly fixed costs. If the company's volume were to increase to 18,000 units of product and/or 30,000 machine hours, the company would likely have to increase its total fixed costs to pay for additional supervisors, space, and other fixed costs. Hence, an experienced accountant would say that the company's fixed costs are approximately $200,000 per month within a relevant range of activity.",what
What is a cost variance?,"Definition of Cost Variance
Generally a cost variance is the difference between the actual amount of a cost and its budgeted or planned amount. For example, if a company had actual repairs expense of $950 for May but the budgeted amount was $800, the company had a cost variance of $150. When the actual cost is more than the budgeted amount, the cost variance is said to be unfavorable. When an actual cost is less than the budgeted amount, the cost variance is said to be favorable.
Cost Variances in Standard Costing Systems
Cost variances are a key part of the standard costing system used by some manufacturers. In such a system, the cost variances direct attention to the difference between 1) the standard, predetermined and expected costs of the good output, and 2) the actual manufacturing costs incurred. These cost variances send a signal to management that the company is experiencing actual costs that are different from the company's plan.
Standard costing systems report a minimum of two cost variances for each of the following manufacturing costs:

Direct materials
Direct labor
Manufacturing overhead",what
What is the difference between a budget and a standard?,"A budget usually refers to a department's or a company's projected revenues, costs, or expenses. A standard usually refers to a projected amount per unit of product, per unit of input (such as direct materials, factory overhead), or per unit of output.
For example, a manufacturer will have budgets for its manufacturing or factory overhead departments. Let's assume that the budgeted manufacturing overhead for the upcoming year is expected to be $1,000,000 in order to produce the expected 100,000 identical units of product. The standard cost of manufacturing overhead per unit of product is $10 ($1,000,000 divided by 100,000 units). When the products are not identical, the $1,000,000 of manufacturing overhead might be divided by the expected number of machine hours required to manufacture the units of product. Assuming it will take 50,000 machine hours, the standard cost of the manufacturing overhead will be $20 per machine hour ($1,000,000 divided by 50,000 machine hours).",what
What is inventory shrinkage?,"Inventory shrinkage is the term used to describe the loss of inventory. For example, if the inventory records of a retailer report that 3,261 units of Product X are on hand, but a physical count indicates that there are only 3,248 units on hand, there is an inventory shrinkage of 13 units. The retailer's inventory shrinkage might be due to shoplifting, employee theft, damage, obsolescence, etc.
The term shrinkage is also used by manufacturers when referring to the loss of raw materials during a production process. For example, a manufacturer of baked food items will experience shrinkage throughout its processes due to ingredients adhering to the beaters and bowls, and also due to evaporation. This shrinkage is also known as spoilage or waste and it can be either normal or abnormal.",what
What is the meaning of a favorable budget variance?,"A favorable budget variance indicates that an actual result is better for the company (or other organization) than the amount that was budgeted.
Here are three examples of favorable budget variances:

Actual revenues are more than the budgeted or planned revenues.
Actual expenses are less than the budget or plan.
 Actual manufacturing costs are less than the amount budgeted for the period.

Occasionally, a favorable budget variance for revenues will be analyzed to determine whether it was the result of higher than planned selling prices, greater quantities, or a more favorable mix of items sold.
Similarly, a favorable budget variance for expenses will be analyzed to identify the cause of the lower expenses.",what
What are direct materials?,"Direct materials are the traceable matter used in manufacturing a product. The direct materials for a manufacturer of dessert products will include flour, sugar, eggs, milk, vegetable oil, spices, and other ingredients in the recipes. In manufacturing, the direct materials are listed in each product's bill of materials. (Indirect materials such as oil for greasing the baking pans, etc. will likely be viewed as part of the manufacturing supplies and will be allocated to products along with other manufacturing overhead.)
The direct materials contained in manufactured products are also defined as:

a product cost (along with the costs of the direct labor and manufacturing overhead)
an inventoriable cost (along with the costs of direct labor and manufacturing overhead)
a prime cost (along with the cost of direct labor)

The costs of direct materials should be reported in the financial statements according to their location or position:

if not yet put into production, report as raw materials inventory on the balance sheet
if put into production but the goods are not completed, report as part of the cost of work-in-process inventory on the balance sheet
if put into production and the goods are completed but not yet sold, report as part of the cost of the finished goods inventory on the balance sheet
if put into production and the goods have been completed and sold, report as part of the cost of goods sold on the income statement",what
What is the difference between cost and price?,"Some people use cost and price interchangeably. Others use the term cost to mean one component of a product's selling price. Even the same person might use the terms differently.
For example, in standard costing the price variance of the raw materials refers to the difference between the standard cost and the actual cost of the materials.
In other situations we define a product's selling price as: product costs + expenses + profit.
As these two examples indicate, there can be different meanings for the terms cost and price.",what
"In standard costing, how is the purchase price variance reclassified to arrive at actual cost?","I assume that the purchase price variance was recorded at the time that the raw materials were purchased. If that price variance is significant, it should be reclassified to the following: raw materials inventory, work-in-process inventory, finished goods inventory, and cost of goods sold. The reclassification is also known as prorating the variance or allocating the variance.
The reclassification of the purchase price variance should be based on the location of the raw materials which had created the price variance. If those raw materials were recently purchased and are entirely in the raw materials inventory, then all of the price variance should be assigned to the raw materials inventory. If the price variance occurred throughout the year, the variance should be assigned to the raw materials inventory, work-in-process inventory, finished goods inventory, and cost of goods sold based on the quantity of the raw materials in each of these categories.
If the amount of the purchase price variance is very small and/or the inventory turnover rates are very high, the entire amount of the price variance might be reclassified entirely to the cost of goods sold.",what
What is a fixed cost?,"A fixed cost is one that does not change in total within a reasonable range of activity. For example, the rent for a production facility is a fixed cost if the rent will not change when there are reasonable changes in the amount of output or input. (Of course, if there is a need to double the output the rent will change when the company occupies additional work space.)
While a fixed cost remains constant in total, the fixed cost per unit of output or input will change inversely with the change in the quantity of output or input. For instance, if the rent of the production facility is fixed at $120,000 per year and there are 30,000 machine hours of good output during the year, the rent will be $4 ($120,000/30,000) per machine hour. If there are 40,000 machine hours during the year, the rent will be $3 ($120,000/40,000) per machine hour.
Many manufacturing overhead costs are fixed and the amounts occur in large increments. Some examples include depreciation on a company-owned factory, depreciation on machinery and equipment, salaries and benefits of manufacturing supervisors, factory administration costs, etc. One challenge for accountants is the allocation or assigning of the large fixed costs to the individual units of product (which likely vary in size and complexity). This allocation (or assigning or absorbing) is required by the accounting and income tax rules for valuing inventories and the cost of goods sold. If the fixed overhead is assigned using machine hours, one must keep in mind that the cost rate per machine hour is not how the fixed costs behave or occur. In our example, the cost of the rent might be assigned to the products at the rate of $3 or $4 per machine hour but the rent actually occurs at the rate of $10,000 per month.",what
What is the meaning of fixed overhead absorbed?,"This phrase is used in cost accounting and involves the assigning, applying, or allocating of fixed manufacturing overhead costs to the units produced by a manufacturer.
Three examples of fixed manufacturing overhead costs include 1) depreciation of the manufacturing equipment, 2) the property tax on the factory building, and 3) the salaries of the factory supervisors. Each of these costs comes in large dollar amounts (they do not occur at a rate of say $1.00 per unit) and none is directly traceable to the products manufactured. The dollar amount of each of these costs will probably not change if the company produces 10% more units or 10% fewer units.
Because the fixed manufacturing overhead costs are indirect product costs (not directly traceable to the products) the accountant allocates (or assigns or applies) these costs to the products on some basis—perhaps on the basis of machine hours or through activity-based costing. While the accountant assigns or allocates these costs, the products are said to be absorbing these fixed manufacturing costs. (Absorption costing, which is required for external financial statements, means that each product's cost includes direct materials, direct labor, variable manufacturing overhead, and fixed manufacturing overhead.)
Fixed manufacturing overhead cost is usually applied to the products (and is absorbed by the products) through the use of a predetermined annual overhead rate that is based on some planned volume of production. If the actual product volume is less than the planned volume (and the costs are as planned) the fixed manufacturing overhead will be underabsorbed. When the actual volume exceeds the planned volume and the costs are as planned, the fixed manufacturing overhead will be overabsorbed.",what
What is the materials usage variance?,"The materials usage variance, which is also referred to as the materials quantity variance, is associated with a standard costing system. The materials usage variance results when a company uses more or less than the standard quantity of materials (input) that should have been used for the products actually manufactured (the good output).
The materials usage variance is unfavorable when the actual quantity of materials used exceeded the standard quantity of materials. The materials usage variance is favorable when the actual quantity of materials used was less than the standard quantity. In the U.S. the materials usage variance is expressed in dollars, which is calculated by multiplying the favorable or unfavorable quantity (such as pounds) times the standard cost per pound.
To illustrate, let's assume that a company has a standard of 5 pounds of materials to produce one unit of output. The company also established that the standard cost per pound of the materials is $3 per pound. If the company produced 100 units of output, the company should have used 500 pounds of input (100 units of good output X 5 pounds of input per unit of output). If the company actually used 530 pounds of input, the materials usage variance will be $90 unfavorable (30 pounds of additional input X the standard cost per pound of $3). The $90 unfavorable materials usage variance can be explained by the following: $1,590 (530 actual pounds used X $3 standard cost) vs. the standard of $1,500 (100 units of output X 5 standard pounds = 500 standard pounds x $3 standard cost).",what
What is a learning curve?,"A common learning curve shows that the cumulative average time to complete a manual task which involves learning will decrease 20% whenever volume doubles. This is referred to as an 80% learning curve.
Let's illustrate the 80% learning curve with a person learning to design and code websites of similar size and complexity. If the first website takes 100 hours, then after the second website the cumulative average time will be 80 hours (80% of 100 hours). The cumulative average of 80 hours consists of 100 hours for the first website plus only 60 hours for the second website resulting in a total of 160 hours divided by 2 websites. After the fourth website the cumulative average time will be 64 hours (80% of 80 hours). After the eighth website the cumulative average will be 51.2 hours (80% of 64 hours). In other words, the total time to have completed all eight websites will be 409.6 hours (8 websites times an average time of 51.2 hours).
Improvements in technology can mean time and cost reductions beyond those in the learning curve. For example, software may become available to assist in the design and coding, computer processing speeds might increase, there may be lower costs of processing and storage, etc.
The learning curve is important for setting standards, estimating costs, and establishing selling prices.",what
Is standard costing GAAP?,"Standard costing was developed to assist a manufacturer plan and control its operations. Generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP require that a manufacturer's financial statements comply with the cost principle. This means that the inventories, the cost of goods sold, and the resulting net income must reflect the manufacturer's actual costs.
Standard costing will meet the GAAP requirements if the variances between the standard costs and the actual costs are properly prorated to the inventories and to the cost of goods sold prior to issuing the financial statements.",what
What does the direct labor efficiency variance tell us?,"This variance tells us how efficient the direct labor was in making the actual output that was produced by the direct labor.
The direct labor efficiency variance compares the standard hours that it should have taken to make the actual output Vs. the actual hours it took and multiplies the difference in hours by the standard cost per direct labor hour.
Here's an example with amounts. Let's assume the standard for direct labor is 3 hours per unit of output and the standard cost for an hour of direct labor is $10. Let's say the output for the period is 6,000 units and the actual direct labor hours were 18,400 hours and the labor earned $10.30 per hour. The standard direct labor cost for the actual output should have been 18,000 hours (6,000 units of output times 3 standard hours) at $10 per hour for a total of $180,000. The actual direct labor cost was $189,520 (18,400 hours at $10.30 per hour). This means a TOTAL (efficiency and rate) variance of $9,520. Some of that variance is due to the rate being $0.30 too much and some of that variance is due to the direct labor using too many hours—not being efficient.
The direct labor efficiency variance focuses on the direct labor hours: 6,000 units of output should have taken 3 hours each for a total of 18,000 direct labor hours. The actual direct labor hours were 18,400 hours. This means there was an unfavorable direct labor efficiency variance of 400 hours times the standard rate of $10 for a total of $4,000.
The direct labor rate variance is the $0.30 unfavorable variance in the hourly rate ($10.30 actual rate Vs. $10.00 standard rate) times the 18,400 actual hours for an unfavorable direct labor rate variance of $5,520.
The combination of the unfavorable direct labor efficiency variance of $4,000 + the unfavorable direct labor rate variance of $5,520 is the total unfavorable direct labor variance of $9,520.",what
How is the material usage variance account reported on the financial statements?,"The material usage variance in a standard costing system results from using more or less than the standard quantity of direct materials specified for the actual goods produced. If the actual quantity of the input direct materials is more than the standard quantity allowed for the good output, the variance is unfavorable and the Material Usage Variance account will have a debit balance . If the actual quantity of the input direct materials is less than the standard quantity allowed for the good output, the variance is favorable and a credit will be entered in the Materials Usage Variance account.
When preparing the financial statements, a debit balance in the Materials Usage Variance account (which means an unfavorable variance) will have to be added to the standard cost of the products. If the standard costs associated with the variance are in the goods that have been sold, the debit balance in the variance account will be added to the Cost of Goods Sold, an income statement expense. (This is reasonable, because the standard cost is too low compared to the actual cost of the materials.) If the output associated with the variances is entirely in finished goods inventory, then the debit balance in the variance account will be added to the finished goods inventory amount reported on the balance sheet. Again, this is necessary because the standard cost of the finished goods inventory is too low. If the products are in work in process, finished goods inventory, and cost of goods sold, you would assign the variance to all three categories based on the proportions associated with the variance amounts. Accountants refer to this as prorating the variances. If the variance amount is insignificant, accountants will simply assign these small variances to the cost of goods sold. This is reasonable if most of the goods that were produced have been sold. Generally, inventories are small in relation to the quantities produced.
Credit balances in the variance accounts represent favorable variances and will reduce the standard costs that are reported as debit balances in inventory on the balance sheet or as cost of goods sold expense on the income statement. The favorable variances will be prorated as discussed above or simply credited to cost of goods sold when the variances are not significant or material in amount.",what
Why do manufacturers use standard costs?,"One reason for a manufacturer to use standard costs is to plan carefully what its costs will be for the upcoming budgeting year and to then compare the actual costs with those planned costs. If the actual costs are similar to the standard costs (the planned costs; what the costs should be) the company is on track to reach the cost part of its profit plan. If the actual costs deviate from the standard costs, management is alerted by the variances  that are reported for materials, labor and manufacturing overhead. Hence standard costs allow a manufacturer to practice management by exception. That is, if the actual costs are what they should be, management action is not required. If the actual costs are more than the standard costs, management must take action or it will not achieve the planned profit.
The standard cost variances direct management's attention to the area where the problems are occurring. If the problems cannot be solved easily, management may need to explore alternate materials or processes, attempt to increase selling prices, etc. Again, without reacting to the variances the company's planned profit for the year will not be met.",what
What is the production volume variance?,"The production volume variance is associated with a standard costing system used by some manufacturers. This variance indicates the difference between 1) the company's budgeted amount of fixed manufacturing overhead costs, and 2) the amount of the fixed manufacturing overhead costs that were assigned to (or absorbed by) the company's production output.
To illustrate the production volume variance, let's assume that a manufacturer had budgeted $300,000 of fixed manufacturing overhead (supervisors' compensation, depreciation, etc.) for the upcoming year. During that period it expected to have 30,000 machines hours of good output. Based on this plan the manufacturer established a fixed manufacturing overhead rate of $10 per standard machine hour. If the company actually produces 29,000 standard machine hours of good output, the products will be assigned (or will have absorbed) $290,000 of the fixed manufacturing overhead. This will cause an unfavorable production volume variance of $10,000 ($300,000 budgeted vs. $290,000 assigned; or 1,000 too few standard machine hours of good output X $10 per standard machine hour).
If our example had stated that the manufacturer actually produced 32,000 standard machine hours of good output, the products would have been assigned $320,000 of fixed manufacturing overhead costs compared to the budgeted amount of $300,000. This scenario would result in a favorable production volume variance of $20,000 ($300,000 budgeted vs. $320,000 assigned; or 2,000 additional standard machine hours of good output X $10 per standard machine hour).",what
What do overabsorbed and underabsorbed mean?,"In cost accounting, manufacturing overhead costs are often assigned to products by using a predetermined overhead rate. The predetermined rate is likely based on an annual manufacturing overhead budget divided by some activity such as the expected number of machine hours. Instead of saying that the manufacturing overhead is assigned, we might say it is allocated, applied or apportioned to the products manufactured during the period. We could also say that the products have absorbed the overhead.
If the amount of overhead assigned to the products manufactured is greater than the amount of overhead actually incurred, the products have overabsorbed the overhead costs. If the amount of overhead assigned to the products is less than the amount of overhead actually incurred, the products have underabsorbed the overhead costs.
The cause of the overabsorption or underabsorption will be some combination of 1) the quantity of products manufactured, and 2) the actual overhead costs incurred.",what
What is a flexible budget variance?,"Definition of Flexible Budget and Flexible Budget Variance
First, a flexible budget is a budget in which some amounts will increase or decrease when the level of activity changes. A flexible budget variance is the difference between 1) an actual amount, and 2) the amount allowed by the flexible budget.
Static Budget vs. Flexible Budget
To help in understanding the flexible budget variance, let's assume that you are the manager of a company's shipping department. You prepared the department's annual budget based on the company's assumption that 50,000 items will be shipped during the budget year. If the annual budget is not changed when more or less than 50,000 items are shipped, it is referred to as a static budget. A summary of the department's static budget based on shipping 50,000 items is:
Fixed expenses (salaries, utilities, etc.) of $350,000 + variable expenses (cartons, helpers, etc.) of $150,000 (50,000 items X $3 each) = total static budget of $500,000.
Unlike the static budget, a flexible budget for the shipping department will increase when more than 50,000 items for the year are shipped and it will decrease when fewer than 50,000 items are shipped. Let's assume that for the year, the department actually shipped 54,000 items. Therefore, the flexible budget for the variable expenses will ""flex"" for shipping the additional 4,000 items. The resulting flexible budget summary is:
Fixed expenses (salaries, utilities, etc.) of $350,000 + variable expenses (cartons, helpers, etc.) of $162,000 (54,000 items X $3 each) = total flexible budget of $512,000.
Flexible Budget Variance
Now let's assume that the shipping department's actual expenses for the year were:
Fixed expenses of $351,000 + variable expenses of $157,000 = total actual expenses of $508,000.
The department's total flexible budget variance is $4,000 favorable since the actual expenses of $508,000 were less than the flexible budget of $512,000.
Note that the shipping department's total static budget variance is $8,000 unfavorable since the actual expenses of $508,000 were more than the static budget of $500,000.
The $12,000 difference between the two variances result from the flexible budget being increased by $12,000 to recognize that an additional 4,000 items had to be shipped at a budgeted shipping cost of $3 per item.
Flexible Budgets Could Flex for Various Activities
The activities that could cause flexible budgets to flex might be the amount of sales, units of output, machine hours, miles traveled, etc.",what
What is a BOM?,"BOM is the acronym for bill of materials. A BOM is a listing of the quantities of each of the materials used in manufacturing a product.
Industrial manufacturers are likely to have an enormous number of BOMs. Each of the BOMs will be a very detailed list of all of the quantities of every material used in the various steps of manufacturing each part or product.
To visualize a BOM, think of a bakery that produces only pies. Each pie's BOM will list the ingredients in the pie's recipe. Each BOM will list the number of pounds (or other unit of measure) of the specific fruit, the quantity of a specific sugar (or other sweetener), the quantity and type of cinnamon, the quantity of nutmeg, the type of crust. There will also be a BOM for the pie crust. The pie crust BOM will specify the quantity and type of flour, the quantity and type of butter (or oil), the quantity of salt, etc.",what
What causes an unfavorable fixed overhead budget variance?,"An unfavorable fixed overhead budget variance results when the actual amount spent on fixed manufacturing overhead costs exceeds the budgeted amount. The fixed overhead budget variance is also known as the fixed overhead spending variance.
Fixed overhead costs are the indirect manufacturing costs that are not expected to change when the volume of activity changes. Some examples of fixed manufacturing overhead include the depreciation, property tax and insurance of the factory buildings and equipment, and the salaries of the manufacturing supervisors and managers.
Since the fixed manufacturing overhead costs should remain the same within reasonable ranges of activity, the amount of the fixed overhead budget variance should be relatively small.",what
What does an unfavorable volume variance indicate?,"An unfavorable volume variance indicates that the amount of fixed manufacturing overhead costs applied (or assigned) to the manufacturer's output was less than the budgeted or planned amount of fixed manufacturing overhead costs for the same time period. The unfavorable volume variance indicates that the period's output was less than the planned output.
The volume variance is also referred to as the production volume variance, the capacity variance, or the idle capacity variance.
In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued its Statement No. 151, which discusses the reporting of the fixed production overhead when less than normal capacity is utilized. The FASB's Statements of Financial Accounting Standards are available at no cost at www.FASB.org/st.",what
Is a favorable variance always an indicator of efficiency in operation?,"In a standard costing system, some favorable variances are not indicators of efficiency in operations. For example, the materials price variance, the labor rate variance, the manufacturing overhead spending and budget variances, and the production volume variance are generally not related to the efficiency of the operations.
On the other hand, the materials usage variance, the labor efficiency variance, and the variable manufacturing efficiency variance are indicators of operating efficiency. However, it is possible that some of these variances could result from standards that were not realistic. For example, if it realistically takes 2.4 hours to produce a unit of output, but the standard is set for 2.5 hours, there should be a favorable variance of 0.1 hour. This 0.1 hour variance results from the unrealistic standard, rather than operational efficiency.",what
Do variance accounts have an impact on financial statements? Or are they for performance evaluation only?,"Since the financial statements must reflect the cost principle, both the standard costs and the variances must be included in the financial statements.
For example, if a direct material has a standard cost of $400 but the company paid $422, the financial statement must report $422 (the standard cost of $400 plus the price variance of $22).
How the variances are reported on the financial statements is discussed in the last part of our Explanation of Standard Costing.",what
Is there a relationship between direct materials variances and direct labor variances?,"There can be a connection between the direct materials variances and the direct labor variances. In fact, there can be a relationship between many of the variances.
Let's assume that a lower costing material is purchased in order to achieve a favorable materials price variance. If the materials have some negative attributes, it is possible that an unfavorable materials usage variance could result. If the materials' attributes cause additional labor hours, then an unfavorable direct labor efficiency variance will result. If the materials required more experienced labor, it is possible that a labor rate variance will also occur.
The above example can also extend to the overhead variances. If more electricity and supplies had to be used because of the materials' attributes, there will be an unfavorable variable overhead efficiency variance. If the volume of output is curtailed by the materials' attributes, there could possibly be a fixed overhead volume variance.
Companies should have specifications for its materials in order to prevent the above situation from occurring.",what
What is a burden rate in inventory?,"I assume that the burden rate in inventory refers to a manufacturer's indirect manufacturing costs, which are also referred to as factory overhead, indirect production costs, and burden. In the U.S., a manufactured product's cost consists of direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead. Since manufacturing overhead is an indirect cost, it is usually assigned or allocated through an overhead rate or burden rate. Two examples of an overhead or burden rate are 1) a percentage of direct labor, and 2) an hourly cost rate assigned on the basis of machine hours.
A product's manufacturing cost, consisting of direct materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead, is used to report the cost of goods sold and also the cost of units in inventory. Therefore, if you look at the detail of a product's inventory cost, you may see the manufacturing overhead being assigned or applied to the unit through a burden rate.",what
What are the advantages of departmentalizing manufacturing overhead costs?,"The departmentalizing of manufacturing overhead costs allows for better planning and control if the head of each department is held responsible for the costs and productivity of his or her department.
The departmentalizing of manufacturing overhead costs also allows for the computation and application of several departmental overhead cost rates instead of having a single, plant-wide overhead rate. This is important when there are a variety of products and some require many operations in a department with high overhead rates, while other products require very few operations in the high cost department. There may also be products which require many hours of processing, but they occur in low cost departments.  For instance, the assembly and packing departments of a manufacturer are likely to have very low overhead cost rates. On the other hand, the fabricating and milling departments will likely have much higher overhead cost rates.",what
What is a budget variance?,"A budget variance results when an actual amount is different from a planned or budgeted amount.
A budget variance can occur for revenues and for expenses.",what
What is meant by overabsorbed?,"Overabsorbed is usually used in the context of a manufacturer's production overhead costs. Since manufacturing overhead costs are not directly traceable to products, they need to be allocated, assigned, or applied to the products through an overhead rate. We also state that the products absorb the overhead costs through the overhead rate.
The overhead rate is normally a predetermined rate—meaning that it was calculated prior to the start of the accounting year by using 1) the expected amount of overhead costs, and 2) the expected volume of production. Because of these two estimates, it is unlikely that the amount of overhead allocated, applied, assigned, or absorbed will be equal to the actual overhead costs incurred.
If the actual products manufactured are assigned or absorb more overhead through the overhead rate than the actual amount of overhead costs incurred, the products have overabsorbed the overhead costs.
At the end of the accounting year, the amount of the overapplied, overassigned, or overabsorbed overhead is often credited to the cost of goods sold. The reasons are 1) the overabsorbed amount is not significant, and 2) most of the products absorbing too much overhead costs have been sold. If the overabsorbed amount is significant, then the amount overabsorbed must be prorated or allocated as a reduction to the cost of the inventories and to the cost of goods sold based on where the overabsorbed overhead costs are residing at the end of the accounting year.",what
"In least squares regression, what do y and a represent?","Here are the meanings of the components or symbols used in the least squares equation of y = a + bx:
y is the dependent variable, such as the estimated or expected total cost of electricity during a month. The amount of y is dependent upon the amounts of a and bx.
a is the estimated total amount of fixed electricity costs during the month. It is the value of y, when x is zero. If the total cost line intersects the y-axis at $1,000 then it is assumed that the total fixed costs for a month are $1,000.
b is the estimated variable cost per unit of x. It determines the slope of the total cost line. If b is $5, this means that the variable cost portion of electricity is estimated to be $5 for every unit of x.
x is the independent variable. For example, x could represent the known number of machine hours used in the month.
bx is the total variable cost of electricity. If the company's electricity cost is estimated to be $5 per unit of x, and x is 4,000 machine hours, then the total variable cost of electricity for the month is estimated to be $20,000.
In our example the total estimated cost of electricity (y) in a month when x is 4,000 machine hours will be $21,000.",what
What is the normal balance of the direct materials variance accounts?,"I don't believe there is a normal balance. If a company pays exactly the standard cost of its direct materials, there will be no balance in the account Direct Materials Price Variance. If a company uses exactly the standard quantity of direct material for its output, there will be no balance in the account Direct Materials Usage Variance.
If the actual price per unit of direct materials is more than the standard cost per unit, the difference will be entered as a debit into the account Direct Materials Price Variance. If the actual price per unit of direct materials is less than the standard cost per unit, the difference will be entered as a credit into the price variance account.
The account Direct Materials Usage Variance will have a debit entered when the actual quantity of direct material used is greater than the standard quantity for the good output. If the actual quantity of direct material is less than the standard quantity of direct material for the good output, a credit is entered into the usage variance account.
If the standards are realistic, a manufacturer would be pleased with a zero balance in its variance accounts. A credit balance in a variance account signifies that things were better than standard. A debit in a variance account indicates that things were worse than the standard.",what
Why does a cost system developed for inventory valuation distort product cost information?,"The cost system for inventory valuation may have been developed to provide a reasonable total cost of inventory and a reasonable total cost of goods sold in order to have reasonably accurate financial statements. If a company has small inventory amounts and significant sales, a simple cost system that spreads manufacturing overhead costs solely on the basis of machine hours can result in a reasonably accurate balance sheet and income statement.
While a simple cost system using just one cost driver (machine hours) may result in accurate financial statements, it often fails to provide the true cost of individual products that vary in complexity. For example, one product might require very few machine hours but will require many hours of special handling. The costs assigned on the basis of machine hours alone will be too low in relationship to the true cost of manufacturing this product. Another product might require many machine hours but no other activities. This product's cost will be overstated because the rate assigned via the machine hours will include an amount for other activities that generally occur for the other products manufactured.
A cost system developed for inventory valuation is limited to the cost of direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead. The total cost of providing products to a customer will also include nonmanufacturing expenses. One customer might require a company to incur additional selling, delivering, storing, and administrative expenses. Another customer might not require any of those activities and their related expenses.
Activity based costing attempts to calculate the true cost of a product and customer by assigning costs and expenses based on their root causes. Because there are many root causes, the company will assign costs based on many cost drivers. This results in more accuracy for the cost and expense of a specific product for a specific customer than simply spreading the manufacturing costs on the basis of one cost driver such as machine hours.",what
What is an unfavorable variance?,"Definition of a Variance
In accounting the term variance usually refers to the difference between an actual amount and a planned or budgeted amount. For example, if a company's budget for repairs expense is $50,000 and the actual amount ends up being $45,000 or $63,000, there will be a variance of $5,000 or $13,000 respectively. Similarly, if a company has budgeted its revenues to be $280,000 and the actual revenues end up being $271,000 or $291,000, there will be a variance of $9,000 or $11,000 respectively.
When is a Variance Unfavorable
The term unfavorable variance indicates that the variance (or difference between the budgeted and actual amounts) was not good for the company's profits. In other words, this unfavorable variance is one reason for the company's actual profits being worse than the budgeted profits. 
Unfavorable Expense Variance
If repairs expense was budgeted to be $50,000 but the actual repairs expense ends up being $63,000, the $13,000 variance is unfavorable because having more actual expenses than were budgeted was not good for the company's profits. It is one reason why the company's actual profits were worse than the budgeted profits.
Unfavorable Revenue Budget
If a company has budgeted its revenues to be $280,000 and the actual revenues end up being $271,000, the company will have an unfavorable variance of $9,000. The variance is unfavorable because having less actual revenues than the budgeted amount was not good for the company's profits. It will also be one reason for the company's actual profits being worse than the budgeted profits.",what
How do you record a dividend payment to stockholders?,"Definition of Dividend Payment to Stockholders
A dividend payment to stockholders is usually a cash payment which reduces the corporation's asset cash and the corporation's stockholders' equity. There are actually two steps required for a corporation to make a dividend payment:

The corporation's board of directors must declare the dividend, and
The corporation must distribute the cash

Example of Recording a Dividend Payment to Stockholders
On the date that the board of directors declares the dividend, the stockholders' equity account Retained Earnings is debited for the total amount of the dividend that will be paid and the current liability account Dividends Payable is credited for the same amount. (Some corporations will debit the temporary account Dividends instead of debiting Retained Earnings. Then at the end of the year, the Dividends account is closed to Retained Earnings.) 
The second entry occurs on the date of the payment to the stockholders. On that date the current liability account Dividends Payable is debited and the asset account Cash is credited.",what
Where do dividends appear on the financial statements?,"Definition of Dividends
Cash dividends are a distribution of a company's profits.
Financial Statements of a Corporation
The main financial statements of a corporation are:

income statement
statement of comprehensive income
balance sheet
statement of cash flows
statement of stockholders' equity

Where Dividends Appear on the Financial Statements
The dividends declared and paid by a corporation in the most recent year will be reported on these financial statements for the recent year:

statement of cash flows as a use of cash under the heading financing activities
statement of stockholders' equity as a subtraction from retained earnings

Dividends that were declared but not yet paid are reported on the balance sheet under the heading current liabilities.
Dividends on common stock are not reported on the income statement since they are not expenses. However, dividends on preferred stock will appear on the income statement as a subtraction from net income in order to report the earnings available for common stock.",what
What is equity?,"Definitions and Examples of Equity
Equity has several definitions that pertain to accounting:



Equity can indicate an ownership interest in a business, such as stockholders' equity or owner's equity.
Equity can mean the combination of liabilities and owner's equity. For example, the basic accounting equation Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity can be restated to be Assets = Equities.
Equity can mean an owner's interest in a personal asset. For example, the owner of a $200,000 house that has a mortgage loan of $75,000 is said to have $125,000 of equity in the house.

What is the difference between stocks and bonds?,"Definition of Stocks
Stocks, or shares of capital stock, represent an ownership interest in a corporation. Every corporation has common stock. Some corporations issue preferred stock in addition to its common stock. Shares of common stock do not have maturity dates.
Stocks pay dividends, which are a distribution of the corporation's profits to its owners. However, the dividend occurs only if the corporation's board of directors declare the dividend. The dividend payments are not an expense on the corporation's financial statements or on its U.S. income tax return.
Definition of Bonds
Bonds are a form of long-term debt in which the issuing corporation promises to pay the principal amount at a specified maturity date. 
Bonds also promise to pay a fixed interest payment to the bondholders usually every six months until the bonds mature. In the U.S. the interest paid to the bondholders by the corporation is a deductible expense on the corporation's income tax return.
Typically businesses do not issue bonds.",what
What is retained earnings?,"Definition of Retained Earnings
Retained earnings is the cumulative amount of earnings since the corporation was formed minus the cumulative amount of dividends that were declared. Retained earnings is the corporation's past earnings that have not been distributed as dividends to its stockholders.
Are Retained Earnings an Asset?
The amount of a corporation's retained earnings is reported as a separate line within the stockholders' equity section of the balance sheet. However, the past earnings that have not been distributed as dividends to the stockholders will likely be reinvested in additional income-producing assets or used to reduce the corporation's liabilities. 
Where do Retained Earnings Come From?
At the end of an accounting year, the balances in a corporation's revenue, gain, expense, and loss accounts are used to compute the year's net income. Those account balances are then transferred to the Retained Earnings account. When the year's revenues and gains exceed the expenses and losses, the corporation will have a positive net income which causes the balance in the Retained Earnings account to increase. (If the corporation's revenues and gains for the year are less than the expenses and losses, the result is a net loss that reduces the normal credit balance in the Retained Earnings account.) The balance in the Retained Earnings account is also decreased when the corporation declares a cash dividend. 
What is the Normal Balance in the Retained Earnings Account?
The normal balance in a profitable corporation's Retained Earnings account is a credit balance. This is logical since the revenue accounts have credit balances and expense accounts have debit balances. If the balance in the Retained Earnings account has a debit balance, this negative amount of retained earnings may be described as deficit or accumulated deficit.",what
What is the difference between public sector and private sector?,"Definition of Public Sector
Public sector refers to:

government-owned organizations, and
government-provided services

(Note: public sector entity is different from a publicly-held entity.)
Definition of Private Sector
Private sector refers to:

organizations that are not government owned, and
the goods and services provided by organizations outside of the government

Example of Private Sector
Companies owned by individuals are part of the private sector. Even the largest corporation with its common stock publicly-traded on the New York Stock Exchange is part of the private sector.",what
What is the difference between equity financing and debt financing?,"Definition of Equity Financing
Equity financing involves increasing the owner's equity of a sole proprietorship or increasing the stockholders' equity of a corporation to acquire an asset.
When a corporation issues additional shares of common stock the number of issued and outstanding shares will increase. This increase will cause the previous stockholders' ownership percentage to be reduced.
Definition of Debt Financing
Debt financing means borrowing money in order to acquire an asset. Financing with debt is referred to as financial leverage. Using debt financing allows the existing stockholders to maintain their percentage of ownership, since no new stock is being issued. However, the additional debt adds risk and may result in higher interest rates for future loans.
Debt financing often comes with strict conditions or covenants regarding interest and principal payments, maintaining certain financial ratios, and more. Failure to meet those conditions can result in severe consequences. In the U.S., a benefit of debt financing is that the interest on the debt is an income tax deductible expense. This income tax savings will partially offset the interest expense on the debt.",what
How do cash dividends affect the financial statements?,"Definition of Cash Dividends
Cash dividends are a distribution of a corporation's earnings to its stockholders or shareholders. For cash dividends to occur, the corporation's board of directors must declare the dividends.
Examples of How Cash Dividends Affect the Financial Statements
When a corporation's board of directors declares a cash dividend on its stock, the following will occur:

Retained earnings (a part of stockholders' equity) will decrease
Current liabilities (such as Dividends Payable) will increase

When the cash dividend is paid, the following will occur:

Current liabilities (Dividends Payable) will decrease
Current assets (Cash) will decrease

The income statement is not affected by the declaration and payment of cash dividends on common stock. (However, the cash dividends on preferred stock are deducted from net income to arrive at net income available for common stock.)
The statement of cash flows will report the amount of the cash dividends as a use of cash in the financing activities section.",what
What type of account is the Dividends account?,"Definition of Dividends Account
The account Dividends (or Cash Dividends Declared) is a temporary, stockholders' equity account that is debited for the amount of the dividends that a corporation declares on its capital stock. At the end of the accounting year, the balance in the Dividends account is closed by transferring the account balance to Retained Earnings. (Corporations could debit Retained Earnings directly when dividends are declared. In that case the Dividends account is not used.) 
Example of Using the Dividends Account
When a corporation declares a cash dividend on its common stock, it will credit a current liability account Dividends Payable and will debit either:

Retained Earnings, or
Dividends

Dividends is a balance sheet account. However, it is a temporary account because its debit balance will be closed to the Retained Earnings account at the end of the accounting year.",what
What is the difference between stockholder and stakeholder?,"Definition of Stockholder
A stockholder or shareholder is the owner of shares of a corporation's common or preferred stock.
Definition of Stakeholder
A stakeholder is anyone that has an interest or is affected by a corporation or other organization. In other words, a stockholder isn't the only party having a stake in the corporation. 
Examples of Stakeholders
The stakeholders in a corporation include its: stockholders, creditors, employees, families of the employees, suppliers, customers, community, and others.
A example of an organization that does not have stockholders is a state university. Even though it does not have stockholders, the university will have the following stakeholders: students, students' families, alumni, professors, administrators, businesses, state taxpayers, the local community, the state community, society in general, custodians, suppliers, etc.",what
How do you record an owner's money that is used to start a company?,"Recording Money to Start a Sole Proprietorship
If Amy Ott begins a sole proprietorship by putting money into her business, the sole proprietorship will debit Cash and will credit the Amy Ott, Capital. If Amy Ott also lends some money to the business, the entry will be to debit Cash and credit a liability account such as Notes Payable. (If Amy invests an asset other than cash, the business will record the cash equivalent or fair market value of the asset.)
Recording Money to Start a Corporation
If Amy Ott decided to form a regular corporation and invest cash in exchange for shares of the new corporation's common stock, Cash will be debited and the account Common Stock will be credited. (If the common stock has a par value, Paid-in Capital in Excess of Par is also used.) If Amy also lends cash to the corporation, Cash will be debited and the liability account Notes Payable to Stockholder will be credited. (If Amy invests an asset other than cash, the corporation will record the cash equivalent or fair market value of the asset, unless the fair value of the common stock being issued has a more clear value.)
You should consult with your accounting and tax professional as well as an attorney regarding the type of business structure to be used and the pros and cons of investing versus lending to a new business.",what
Are retained earnings an asset?,"Definition of Retained Earnings
Usually, retained earnings consists of a corporation's earnings since the corporation was formed minus the amount that was distributed to the stockholders as dividends. In other words, retained earnings is the amount of earnings that the stockholders are leaving in the corporation to be reinvested.
The amount of retained earnings is reported in the stockholders' equity section of the corporation's balance sheet.
Are Retained Earnings an Asset?
While the amount of a corporation's retained earnings is reported in the stockholders' equity section of the balance sheet, the cash that was generated from those retained earnings is not likely be in the company's checking account. Instead, the corporation likely used the cash to acquire additional assets in order to generate additional earnings for its stockholders. In some cases, the corporation will use the cash from the retained earnings to reduce its liabilities. As a result, it is difficult to identify exactly where the retained earnings are presently.
One can get a sense of how the retained earnings have been used by studying the corporation's balance sheet and its statement of cash flows.",what
What is a capital account?,"Definition of Capital Account
In accounting and bookkeeping, a capital account is a general ledger account that is part of the balance sheet classification:

Owner's equity (in a sole proprietorship)
Stockholders' equity (in a corporation)

Examples of Capital Accounts
The sole proprietorship of J. Lee will include the following capital accounts:

J. Lee, Capital, which is increased by J. Lee's investment into the business plus each accounting period's net income, and which is decreased by the debit balance in the account J. Lee, Drawing
J. Lee, Drawing, which is a temporary account that records the proprietor's draws during the year. At the end of the year, the account's debit balance will be closed to owner's capital account

A corporation will likely have the following capital accounts:

Paid-in capital accounts such as Common Stock, Preferred Stock, Paid-in Capital in Excess of Par, which are used to record the amounts received by the corporation when shares of its capital stock were originally issued to investors.
The account Retained Earnings which consists of the amount of the corporation's earnings since the corporation was formed minus the dividends distributed to the stockholders since the corporation was formed.
The account Treasury Stock, which has a debit balance representing the amount paid by the corporation to repurchase its own shares of stock which it did not retire.

Other Information on Capital Accounts
The total of the balances in all of the capital accounts must be equal to the reported total of the company's assets minus its liabilities. Because of the historical cost principle and other accounting principles, the total amount reported in the capital accounts will not indicate a company's market value.",what
What is par value?,"Definition of Par Value
Par value is a per share amount that will appear on some stock certificates and in the corporation's articles of incorporation. (Some states may require a corporation to have a par value while others states do not require a par value.) (Par value can also refer to an amount that appears on bond certificates.)
In the case of common stock the par value per share is usually a very small amount such as $0.10 or $0.01 and it has no connection to the market value of the share of stock. The par value is sometimes referred to as the common stock's legal capital. When a corporation's common or preferred stock has a par value, corporation's balance sheet will report the total par value of the shares issued for each class of stock. This will be shown as a separate amount in the paid-in capital or contributed capital section of stockholders' equity.
Example of Par Value
Let's assume that a share of common stock has a par value of $0.01 and is sold to an investor for $25. The corporation issuing the stock will debit Cash for $25.00 and will credit Common Stock for $0.01 and will credit Additional Paid-in Capital for $24.99.",what
What is stockholders' equity?,"Definition of Stockholders' Equity
Stockholders' equity (also known as shareholders' equity) is reported on a corporation's balance sheet and its amount is the difference between the amount of the corporation's assets and its liabilities.
Generally, stockholders' equity consists of the amounts the corporation had received from the sale of its common and preferred shares of stock plus the earnings of the corporation minus any distributions to the stockholders. In other words, stockholders' equity is one source of the corporation's assets. (The other source are the corporation's creditors as evidenced by the liabilities.) 
Stockholders' equity and liabilities are also seen as the claims to the corporation's assets. However, the stockholders' claim comes after the liabilities have been paid.
Stockholders' equity is also the corporation's total book value (which is different from the corporation's worth or market value).
Components of Stockholders' Equity
The amount of stockholders' equity is reported on the balance sheet as follows:

Paid-in capital. This is the amount that the corporation received when it issued shares of its capital stock with common stock and preferred stock (if any) reported separately.
Retained earnings. Generally this is the cumulative earnings of the corporation minus the cumulative amount of dividends declared.
Accumulated other comprehensive income. This is the cumulative amount of income (or loss) for a few items that are not reported on the corporation's income statement.
Treasury stock. This is a reduction of stockholders' equity for the amount the corporation paid to purchase but not retire its own shares of capital stock.

The changes which occurred in stockholders' equity during the accounting period are reported in the corporation's statement of stockholders' equity.",what
What is the expanded accounting equation?,"Definition of Expanded Accounting Equation
The expanded accounting equation provides more details for the owner's equity amount shown in the basic accounting equation. The expanded accounting equation for a sole proprietorship is: Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Capital + Revenues – Expenses – Owner's Draws.
The expanded accounting equation for a corporation provides more details for the stockholders' equity amount shown in the basic accounting equation. The expanded accounting equation for a corporation is: Assets = Liabilities + Paid-in Capital + Revenues – Expenses – Dividends – Treasury Stock.
The expanded accounting equation allows you to see separately (1) the impact on equity from net income (increased by revenues, decreased by expenses), and (2) the effect of transactions with owners (draws, dividends, sale or purchase of ownership interest).",what
What is comprehensive income?,"Definition of Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive income for a corporation is the combination of the following amounts which occurred during a specified period of time such as a year, quarter, month, etc.:

Net income or net loss (the details of which are reported on the corporation's income statement), plus
Other comprehensive income (if any)

Examples of other comprehensive income include:

Unrealized gains/losses on hedging derivatives
Foreign currency translation adjustments
Unrealized gains/losses on postretirement benefit plans

Basically, comprehensive income consists of all of the revenues, gains, expenses, and losses that caused stockholders' equity to change during the accounting period.
The amount of net income for the period is added to retained earnings, while the amount of other comprehensive income is added to accumulated other comprehensive income. Retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income are reported on separate lines within stockholders' equity on the end-of-the-period balance sheet.",what
What is net income?,"Definition of Net Income
Net income is the positive result of a company's revenues and gains minus  its expenses and losses. A negative result is referred to as net loss. (There are a few gains and losses which are not included in the calculation of net income. However, they are part of comprehensive income).
Net income is also known as net earnings. The details of the net income calculation are reported in the business's income statement.
The net income of a regular U.S. corporation includes the income tax expense which pertains to the items reported in its income statement. The net income of a sole proprietorship, partnership, and Subchapter S corporation will not include income tax expense since the owners (not the entity) are responsible for the business's income tax.
Effect of Net Income on the Balance Sheet
A corporation's positive net income causes an increase in the retained earnings, which is part of stockholders' equity. A net loss will cause a decrease in retained earnings and stockholders' equity.
A sole proprietorship's net income will cause an increase in the owner's capital account, which is part of owner's equity. A net loss will cause a decrease in the owner's capital account and owner's equity.",what
Where is treasury stock reported on the balance sheet?,"Under the cost method of recording treasury stock, the cost of treasury stock is reported at the end of the Stockholders' Equity section of the balance sheet. Treasury stock will be a deduction from the amounts in Stockholders' Equity.
Treasury stock is the result of a corporation repurchasing its own stock and holding those shares instead of retiring them.
In the general ledger there will be an account Treasury Stock with a debit balance. (At the time of the purchase of treasury stock, the corporation will debit the account Treasury Stock and will credit the account Cash.)",what
What is the difference between paid-in capital and retained earnings?,"Definition of Paid-in Capital
Paid-in capital is one of the major categories of stockholders' equity. Generally, paid-in capital reports the amount that a corporation received from its stockholders (or shareholders) in exchange for the newly issued shares of its capital stock. 
Paid-in capital is also referred to as contributed capital and as permanent capital.
Definition of Retained Earnings
Generally, retained earnings is the cumulative amount of after-tax net income earned by the corporation since its inception minus the dividends that have been distributed to its stockholders since the corporation began.",what
What is the cost of capital?,"Definition of Cost of Capital
The cost of capital is the weighted-average, after-tax cost of a corporation's long-term debt, preferred stock (if any), and the stockholders' equity associated with common stock.
The cost of capital is expressed as a percentage and it is often used to compute the net present value of the cash flows in a proposed investment. It is also considered to be the minimum after-tax internal rate of return to be earned on new investments.
For a profitable U.S. corporation, the costs of bonds and other long-term loans are usually the least expensive components of the cost of capital. One reason is that the interest is deductible for income taxes. For example, a corporation paying 6% on its loans may have an after-tax cost of 4% when its combined federal and state income tax rate is 33%. On the other hand, the dividends paid on the corporation's preferred and common stock are not tax deductible.
The cost of common stock (paid-in capital and retained earnings) is considered to be the most expensive component of the cost of capital because of the risks involved.
Example of Cost of Capital
Assume that a corporation has the following:

$40 million of long-term debt with an after-tax cost of 4%
$10 million of 7% preferred stock
$50 million of common stock and retained earnings with an estimated cost of 15%

The corporation's weighted-average, after-tax cost of capital is:

Long-term debt cost of $1.6 million ($40 million X 4%)
Preferred stock cost of $0.7 million ($10 million X 7%)
Common stock cost of $7.5 million ($50 million X 15%)
Equals a total cost of $9.8 million which divided by $100 million is 9.8%",what
What is the difference between dividends and interest expense?,"Dividends are a distribution of a corporation's earnings to its stockholders. Dividends are not an expense of the corporation and, therefore, dividends do not reduce the corporation's net income or its taxable income. When a dividend of $100,000 is declared and paid, the corporation's cash is reduced by $100,000 and its retained earnings (part of stockholders' equity) is reduced by $100,000.
Interest on bonds and other debt is an expense of the corporation. The interest expense will reduce the corporation's net income and its taxable income. When interest expense occurs and is paid, the corporation's cash is reduced by the interest payment, but some cash will be saved by the reduction in income taxes. The corporation's retained earnings will also be reduced by less than the amount of interest expense. For example, if a corporation has an incremental tax rate of 40%, interest expense of $100,000 will result in $40,000 less in income tax expense and income tax payments. This means that an interest payment of $100,000 will reduce the corporation's cash and retained earnings by the net amount of $60,000 ($100,000 of interest minus $40,000 of tax savings).
Since interest is formally promised to the lenders, accountants must accrue interest expense and the related liability Interest Payable. If the payment for interest is not made, the corporation will face legal consequences.
Dividends on common stock are not legally required. Therefore, if the corporation does not declare a dividend there is no liability for the omitted dividends.",what
What is the difference between par and no par value stock?,"Some states' laws require or may have required common stock issued by corporations residing in their states to have a par value. The par value on common stock has generally been a very small amount per share. Other states might not require corporations to issue stock with a par value. So the par value on common stock is a legal consideration.
From an accounting standpoint, the par value of an issued share of common stock must be recorded in an account separate from the amount received over and above the amount of par value. For example, if a corporation issues 100 new shares of its common stock for a total of $2,000 and the stock's par value is $1 per share, the accounting entry is a debit to Cash for $2,000 and a credit to Common Stock—Par $100, and a credit to Paid-in Capital in Excess of Par for $1,900. In total the Cash account increased by $2,000 and the paid-in capital reported under stockholders' equity increased by a total of $2,000 ($100 + $1,900).
If a corporation is not required to have a par value or a stated value and the corporation issues 100 shares for $2,000, then the accounting entry will be a debit to Cash for $2,000 and a credit to Common Stock for $2,000.
In other words, when the issued stock has a par value, the proceeds from the issuance gets divided between two of the paid-in capital accounts within stockholders' equity. If the issued stock does not have a par value, the proceeds from the issuance goes into just one paid-in capital account within stockholders' equity.",what
What is the difference between public companies and public sector?,"Definition of Public Companies
Public companies are those businesses owned by individuals (and not by a government).
Definition of Publicly-Held Corporation
If a public company is a corporation whose stock is traded on a stock exchange, it is said that the stock is publicly traded or that the corporation is a publicly-held corporation or a publicly-traded corporation.
Definition of Public Sector
Public sector refers to government-owned organizations and government-provided services.",what
What is common stock?,"Definition of Common Stock
Common stock is the type of ownership interest (expressed in ""shares"") that exists at every U.S. corporation. The owners of common stock are known as common stockholders, common shareholders, or simply as stockholders or shareholders. [A relatively few corporations issue preferred stock in addition to its common stock.]
Generally, the holders of common stock elect the corporation's board of directors, vote on mergers, and participate in a corporation's success or failure through increases or decreases in the market value of their shares of common stock. The cash dividends on common stock often increase as the corporations become more successful.
A drawback of common stock is that the common stockholders are last in line to receive payments if a corporation is dissolved.
Common Stock is also the title of the general ledger account that is credited when a corporation issues new shares of common stock. (The amount of the credit will depend on the state's regulations.) The balance in Common Stock will be reported in the corporation's balance sheet as a component of paid-in capital, a section within stockholders' equity.",what
What is treasury stock?,"Definition of Treasury Stock
Treasury stock is usually a corporation's previously issued shares of common stock that have been purchased from the stockholders, but the corporation has not retired the shares. The number of shares of treasury stock (or treasury shares) is the difference between the number of shares issued and the number of shares outstanding. Since the treasury shares result in fewer shares outstanding, there may be a slight increase in the corporation's earnings per share.
Treasury Stock is also the title of a general ledger account that will have a debit balance equal to the cost of the repurchased shares being held by the corporation. The corporation's cost of treasury stock reduces the corporation's cash and the total amount of stockholders' equity.
The shares of treasury stock will not receive dividends, will not have voting rights, and cannot result in an income statement gain or loss. The shares of treasury stock can be sold, retired, or could continue to be held as treasury stock.
Example of Treasury Stock
A corporation has excess cash and does not see any attractive investments. As a result, it decides to purchase 10,000 shares of its 300,000 shares of common stock that is held by its stockholders. The market value of the 10,000 shares is $40 per share. The corporation's entry to record the purchase of these shares of stock is:

Debit Treasury Stock for $400,000
Credit Cash for $400,000",what
What is capital stock?,"Definition of Capital Stock
Capital stock refers to the shares of ownership that have been issued by a corporation. The amount received by the corporation when its shares of capital stock were issued is reported as paid-in capital within the stockholders' equity section of the balance sheet.
Examples of Capital Stock
Capital stock is the combination of a corporation's common stock and preferred stock.
Common stock is issued by every U.S. corporation. A small percentage of corporations also issue preferred stock. The stockholders' equity section of the balance sheet will list the types and amounts of the capital stock.",what
What is stock?,"In accounting there are two common uses of the term stock. One meaning of stock refers to the goods on hand which is to be sold to customers. In that situation, stock means inventory.
The term stock is also used to mean the ownership shares of a corporation. For example, an owner of a corporation will have a stock certificate which provides evidence of his or her ownership of a corporation's common stock or preferred stock. The owner of the corporation's common or preferred stock is known as a stockholder.",what
What are the journal entries for a stock split?,"Definition of a Stock Split
A stock split usually increases the number of shares of a corporation's common stock with the intention of reducing the market price of each share of stock.
Example of a Stock Split
Assume that a corporation's common stock has risen to $150 per share and there are 100,000 shares issued and outstanding. The board of directors would like the shares of common stock to be trading near $50. To achieve this, the board approved a 3-for-1 stock split. After the stock split there are 300,000 shares issued and outstanding. If an individual stockholder owned 10,000 shares or 10% of the 100,000 shares before the stock split, the stockholder will own 30,000 shares or 10% of the 300,000 shares after the stock split.
Journal Entries for a Stock Split
The only journal entry needed for a stock split is a memo entry to note that the number of shares has changed and that the par value per share has changed (if the stock has a par value). However, a typical journal entry (one with a debit and a credit) is not needed since the total dollar amounts for the par value and other components of paid-in capital and stockholders' equity are not changed with a stock split.",what
What is the book value per share of stock?,"If a corporation does not have preferred stock outstanding, the book value per share of stock is a corporation's total amount of stockholders' equity divided by the number of common shares of stock outstanding on that date.
For example, if a corporation without preferred stock has stockholders' equity on December 31 of $12,421,000 and it has 1,000,000 shares of common stock outstanding on that date, its book value per share is $12.42.
Keep in mind that the book value per share will not be the same as the market value per share. One reason is that a corporation's stockholders' equity is simply the difference between the total amount of assets reported on the balance sheet and the total amount of liabilities reported. Noncurrent assets are generally reported at original cost less accumulated depreciation and some valuable assets such as trade names might not be listed on the balance sheet.",what
Is it okay to have negative amounts in the equity section of the balance sheet?,"Definition of Equity Section of the Balance Sheet
The equity section of the balance sheet is known as:

Owner's equity if it is a sole proprietorship. The amount may be reported as a single amount described as owner's capital. On the other hand, it is common for today's accounting software to show three amounts: owner's capital at the start of the year, current year net income, and current year draws by the owner.
Stockholders' equity if it is a corporation. The reported components may be paid-in capital, retained earnings, treasury stock, and accumulated other comprehensive income.

Examples of Negative Amounts in the Equity Section
If the current year's net income is reported as a separate line in the owner's equity or stockholders' equity sections of the balance sheet, a negative amount of net income must be reported. The negative net income occurs when the current year's revenues are less than the current year's expenses.
If the cumulative earnings minus the cumulative dividends declared result in a negative amount, there will be a negative amount of retained earnings. This negative (or positive) amount of retained earnings is reported as a separate line within stockholders' equity.
The owner's drawing account in a sole proprietorship will have a debit balance. Hence, if it is reported as a separate line, it is reported as a negative amount since the owner's equity section of the balance sheet normally has credit balances.
If a corporation has purchased its own shares of stock the cost is recorded as a debit in the account Treasury Stock. The debit balance will be reported as a negative amount in the stockholders' equity section, since this section normally has credit balances. 
Accumulated other comprehensive income can also be a negative (or positive) amount.",what
What is a memorandum entry?,"Definition of Memorandum Entry
A memorandum entry is a short message entered into the general journal and also entered into a general ledger account. It is not a complete journal entry because it does not contain debit and credit amounts.
Example of Memorandum Entry
The following entry for a stock split is an example of a memorandum entry:
""On June 7, 2019 a 2-for-1 stock split was declared for the common stockholders of record as of the end of the day on June 28, 2019. The stock split will result in the number of issued and outstanding shares of common shares increasing from 200,000 shares to 400,000 shares.""
Since a stock split does not change the balance in the Common Stock account, a complete journal entry was not required. The memorandum entry merely notes for future reference that the number of shares of stock has changed.",what
What are the required financial statements?,"The required financial statements for U.S. business corporations are:

Statement of income. This financial statement is also known as the statement of operations, statement of earnings, or income statement. It reports the corporation's revenues, expenses, gains and losses (except for items stipulated as other comprehensive income) for a period of time such as a year, quarter, 13 months, etc.
Statement of comprehensive income. This financial statement begins with the bottom line of the income statement and then lists the items considered to be other comprehensive income. Some of these items involve currency translation, hedging, and pensions.
Balance sheet. This statement of financial position reports a corporation's assets, liabilities and stockholders' equity as of the final instant of the date shown in its heading (December 31, January 31, June 30, etc.)
Statement of cash flows. This statement reports the major causes for the change in cash and cash equivalents during the accounting period. The cash flows are presented as operating, investing, or financing activities.
Statement of stockholders' equity. This financial statement is often presented as the statement of shareholders' equity, statement of equity, statement of changes in stockholders' equity, etc. It reports all of the changes in stockholders' equity which occurred during the accounting period.

The five annual financial statements must be accompanied with notes to the financial statements. These notes are needed in order to disclose additional information about items that are reported or are not reported in the financial statements.
You can see examples of the required financial statements (and the required notes) for a publicly traded U.S. corporation by searching the Internet for the corporation's name plus the words investor relations. Select Annual Reports (or select SEC filings and annual reports or 10-K).",what
What is preferred stock?,"Preferred stock is a type of capital stock issued by some corporations. Preferred stock is also known as preference stock.
The word ""preferred"" refers to the dividends paid by the corporation. Each year, the holders of the preferred stock are to receive their dividends before the common stockholders are to receive any dividend. In exchange for this preferential treatment for dividends, the preferred stockholders (or shareholders) generally will never receive more than the stated dividend. For example, the holder of 100 shares of a corporation's 8% $100 par preferred stock will receive annual dividends of $800 (8% X $100 = $8 per share X 100 shares) before the common stockholders are allowed to receive any cash dividends for the year. Unless the preferred stock has a participating feature, this preferred stockholder will never receive more than $8 per share no matter how successful the corporation becomes.
The features of preferred stocks can vary. Examples include cumulative, convertible, callable, participating, and more.
Since the dividend on preferred stock is usually a fixed amount forever, once the preferred stock is issued its market value is likely to move in the opposite direction of inflation. The higher the rate of inflation, the less valuable is the fixed dividend amount. If the inflation rate declines, the value of the preferred stock is likely to increase, but no higher than the stock's call price.
Most corporations do not issue preferred stock. Typically, corporations will issue only common stock and use debt.",what
What is a dividend?,"A cash dividend is a distribution of a portion of a corporation's earnings to its stockholders.
A stock dividend (as opposed to a cash dividend) is a distribution of more shares of a corporation's own stock to its stockholders.",what
What is a stockholder?,"A stockholder (also known as a shareholder) is the owner of one or more shares of a corporation's capital stock. A stockholder is considered to be separate from the corporation and as a result will have limited liability as far the corporation's obligations.
The owner of a corporation's common stock is referred to as a common stockholder. The common stockholders elect the corporation's board of directors and will vote on very significant transactions such as merging the corporation with another corporation. Generally it is the common stockholders who become wealthy when a corporation becomes increasingly more successful.
In addition to common stock, some corporations also issue preferred stock. An owner of these shares is known as a preferred stockholder (or preferred shareholder). A preferred stockholder usually accepts a fixed cash dividend that will be paid by the corporation before the common stockholders are paid a dividend. In exchange for this preferential treatment of dividends, the preferred stockholder will forego the potential financial gains that may occur for the common stockholder.
The amounts paid by the original stockholders are reported as paid-in (or contributed) capital within the stockholders' equity section of the corporation's balance sheet.",what
How are dividends paid when there are dividends in arrears?,"When a corporation has dividends in arrears on its cumulative preferred stock, it must first pay the past omitted preferred dividends and then the current year's preferred dividends before it can pay its common stockholders any dividends.
For example, if a corporation has cumulative preferred stock with an annual dividend of $10,000 and it has omitted the dividends for the past three years, there is $30,000 of dividends in arrears. In order to pay any dividend to its common stockholders, the corporation will have to first pay its preferred stockholders $40,000. That is the amount of the past omitted dividends of $30,000 and the current year preferred dividend of $10,000.
Using the information above, but assuming that the corporation pays a total of only $5,000 in dividends in the current year, the preferred stockholders must receive the entire $5,000 and the dividends in arrears will be $35,000 at the end of the current year.",what
What are dividends?,"In accounting, dividends often refers to the cash dividends that a corporation pays to its stockholders (or shareholders). Dividends are often paid quarterly, but could be paid at other times. For a dividend to be paid, the corporation's board of directors must formally approve/declare the dividend. Hence, the board of directors may decide that a dividend will not be declared.
Definition of Dividends
It is important to note that the dividends declared and paid by a corporation are not an expense of the corporation. Rather, dividends are a distribution of the corporation's earnings. This explains why state laws likely require corporations to have a credit balance in Retained Earnings before declaring and paying dividends. Practically speaking, the corporation must also have sufficient cash available to meet its current and future needs.
While all corporations have common stock, some corporations will also have preferred stock. In that situation the preferred stockholders must receive their dividend before the common stockholders.
Declaring a Dividend
When the board of directors declares a dividend, it will result in a debit to Retained Earnings and a credit to a liability such as Dividends Payable. When the corporation pays the dividend, Dividends Payable will be debited and Cash will be credited.
Since Retained Earnings is a component of stockholders' equity, the declaration and payment of a dividend reduces the corporation's assets and its stockholders' equity.",what
What is capital surplus?,"In the past, capital surplus was used to describe what is now referred to as paid-in capital in excess of par.
For example, when a corporation issues shares of its common stock and receives more than the par value of the stock, two accounts are involved: 1) the account Common Stock is used to record the par value of the shares being issued, and 2) the amount that is greater than the par value is recorded in an account entitled Paid-in Capital in Excess of Par—Common Stock, or Premium on Common Stock.
Many years ago, the account Paid-in Capital in Excess of Par—Common Stock and the account Premium on Common Stock were referred to as capital surplus.",what
What is the difference between stockholder and shareholder?,There is no difference between stockholder and shareholder. The terms are used interchangeably. Both terms mean the owner of shares of stock in a corporation and a part owner of a corporation.,what
"Is contributed capital a noncurrent asset or a current asset, and is it a debit or credit?","The account Contributed Capital is part of stockholders' equity and it will have a credit balance. Contributed capital is also referred to as paid-in capital.
When a corporation issues shares of its stock for cash, the corporation's current asset Cash will increase with the debit part of the entry, and the account Contributed Capital will increase with the credit part of the entry. If the corporation then uses some of its cash to purchase equipment, its current asset Cash will decrease and its noncurrent asset Equipment will increase.
If a corporation receives equipment in exchange for newly issued shares of stock, the noncurrent asset Equipment will increase and Contributed Capital will increase.",what
What are the reasons for a stock dividend instead of a cash dividend?,"A corporation might declare a stock dividend instead of a cash dividend in order to 1) increase the number of shares of stock outstanding, 2) move some of its retained earnings to paid-in capital, and 3) minimize distributing the corporation's cash to its stockholders.
If a corporation has 100,000 shares of stock outstanding and it declares a 10% stock dividend, the corporation ends up having 110,000 shares outstanding. An individual stockholder having 1,000 shares prior to the 10% stock dividend will have 1,100 shares after the stock dividend. This individual's stake in the corporation was 1% (1,000 out of 100,000 shares) prior to the stock dividend and will remain at 1% (1,100 out of 110,000 shares) after the stock dividend.
Since the corporation hasn't really changed because of the stock dividend, the total market value of the corporation should not change. In other words, if the total market value of the corporation was $1 million before the stock dividend, it should be $1 million after the stock dividend. However, the market value of each share should decrease: $1,000,000 divided by 100,000 shares = $10 per share, and $1,000,000 divided by 110,000 shares = $9.0909. The total market value of the individual's holdings should also remain the same: 1,000 shares X $10 = $10,000, and 1,100 shares X $9.0909 = $10,000. If the market does not adjust for the increased number of shares, the individual stockholders will benefit.",what
What are the stockholders' equity accounts?,"The stockholders' equity accounts are balance sheet accounts and a part of the accounting equation Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders' Equity. In this light you can view the stockholders' equity accounts (along with the liability accounts) as sources of the amounts reported in the asset accounts.
If the source of an asset was an investor purchasing new shares of common stock, the corporation would credit the stockholders' equity account Common Stock and perhaps Paid-in Capital in Excess of Par—Common Stock, or Premium on Common Stock. If the source of an asset was an investor purchasing new shares of preferred stock, the corporation would credit the stockholders' equity account Preferred Stock and perhaps Paid-in Capital in Excess of Par—Preferred Stock, or Premium on Preferred Stock.
If the source of an asset was the net income earned by the corporation, the stockholders' equity account Retained Earnings would be credited. If a corporation reduces its assets by purchasing its stock from its stockholders, the contra-stockholders' equity account Treasury Stock is debited.",what
What is the transaction approach and balance sheet approach to measuring net income?,"The transaction approach to measuring net income is the traditional bookkeeping and accounting method. That is, individual transactions such as each sale, each purchase, and every expense are recorded into general ledger accounts. At any point you can go to an account such as Salaries Expense for Sales Staff and see the year to date amount of such an expense. With the use of accounting software, an enormous quantity of transactions can be recorded into many detailed accounts.
I believe that the balance sheet approach is also referred to as the capital maintenance approach. Under the balance sheet approach one looks at the change in stockholders' or owner's equity to determine the amount of net income during the period between balance sheets. This approach requires that you exclude any additional capital from the owners as well as any dividends or withdrawals distributed to the owners. For example, if stockholders' equity increased by $5 million with $2 million caused by the issuance of new shares of stock, and $1 million distributed as dividends, the net income would have been $4 million. We can verify the calculation with the following:  net income of $4 (an addition to equity) plus new investor money of $2 (an addition to equity) = $6 of additions to equity, minus dividends of  $1 (a decrease to equity) = $5 (the net increase to equity). Under this balance sheet approach you will not have the detailed information on revenues and expenses that would be available under the transaction approach.",what
A corporation has a large balance in retained earnings. Does that mean that its dividends to stockholders will be increasing?,"Not necessarily. The balance in retained earnings means that the company has been profitable over the years and its dividends to stockholders have been less than its profits. It is possible that a company with billions of dollars of retained earnings has very little cash available today.
One possible explanation for the small amount of cash in relation to the retained earnings is that the company invested in new plant assets in order to expand its operations. Rather than distributing the company's cash to its stockholders, the company used the cash to pay for the factory and equipment in order to meet demand for its new product line.
Corporations might have a stated policy on dividends. For example, a corporation might pay dividends equal to approximately 40% of its earnings. Another corporation might have a plan to increase the amount of dividends each year by more than the rate of inflation. A new corporation might pay no dividends until its ratio of debt to equity is a specified percentage.",what
What is the meaning of arrears?,"In accounting we use the word arrears in at least two ways. One use involves the omitted dividends on cumulative preferred stock. For example, if a corporation has cumulative preferred stock and due to a shortage of cash decides to omit the dividend on those preferred shares, the preferred dividend is in arrears. The result of having these dividends in arrears is that the owners of the common stock cannot receive a dividend until the preferred stock's dividends in arrears are paid and the preferred stock's current year dividend is also paid. Having dividends in arrears also requires a disclosure in the notes to the financial statements.
Arrears is also used in the context of annuities. When an annuity's equal payments occur at the end of each period, the annuity is said to be an annuity in arrears or an ordinary annuity.
Arrears is also used to simply mean past due, or behind in payments.",what
What is premium on common stock?,"The premium on common stock involves the amount the issuing corporation receives when it issues common stock having a par value. The premium on common stock is the dollar amount that is in excess of the common stock's par value.
To illustrate the premium on common stock, let's assume that a corporation issues one share of its common stock having a par value of $0.10 per share. If the corporation receives $20 in exchange for the share, $19.90 will be recorded as the premium on common stock.
Accounting textbooks often refer to the premium on common stock as paid-in capital in excess of par value–common stock or as contributed capital in excess of par value–common stock.",what
What does the term arrears mean in accounting?,"In accounting, arrears is used in at least two situations. One use involves the past, omitted dividends on cumulative preferred stock. If a corporation fails to declare the preferred dividend, those dividends are said to be in arrears. The dividends in arrears must be disclosed in the notes (footnotes) to the financial statements. (Cumulative preferred stock requires that any past, omitted dividends must be paid to the preferred stockholders before the common stockholders will be paid any dividend.)
Another use of the word arrears occurs with annuities. (An annuity is a series of equal amounts occurring at equal time intervals...such as $1,000 per month for 20 years.) If the recurring amount comes at the end of each period, the annuity is described as an annuity in arrears or as an ordinary annuity. A loan repayment schedule is usually an annuity in arrears. For example, you borrow $10,000 on September 30 and your first monthly payment will be due on October 31, the second payment will be due on November 30, and so on.",what
What is the statement of stockholders' equity?,"Definition of the Statement of Stockholders' Equity
The statement of stockholders' equity (also known as the statement of shareholders' equity, statement of equity,
statement of changes in stockholders' equity, statement of changes in shareholders' equity, and statement of changes in equity) is one of the five required financial statements issued by a U.S. corporation whose common stock is publicly traded. This financial statement summarizes on one page all of the changes that occurred in the stockholders' equity accounts during the accounting year.
Examples of the Columns Often Appearing on the Statement
The statement usually has the following columns into which the amounts will be sorted:

Common stock issued - number of shares
Common stock issued - total par value
Additional paid-in capital - common stock
Treasury stock - number of shares
Treasury stock - total cost
Retained earnings
Accumulated other comprehensive income or loss
Total stockholders' equity

Examples of the Descriptions for the Rows or Lines Appearing on the Statement
Some typical descriptions for the amounts being reported include:

Beginning balances
Net earnings or loss
Other comprehensive income or detailed amounts
Stock-based compensation
Exercise of stock options
Sale of common stock
Repurchase of common stock
Cash dividends declared
Ending balances

To see a statement of stockholders' equity, search the internet by entering a corporation's name and the words investor relations 10-K. From the website select annual filings for Form 10-K. Choose the PDF format. Approximately half way down on the table of contents you will see Financial Statements. When you review the statement of stockholders' equity you will see that it reports the amounts for each of the most recent three years.",what
What is the meaning of pro rata?,"Pro rata is a Latin term that means in proportion. Pro rata is related to prorate, a term used in cost accounting.
To illustrate the term pro rata, let's assume that a company's standard costing system has an unfavorable materials price variance of $400,000. If that amount is significant, the company will prorate the $400,000 to its inventory and to its cost of goods sold. Let's also assume that the proration will be based on the company's $1 million of standard materials costs in its inventories and $9 million of standard materials costs in its cost of goods sold. On this basis the inventories' pro rata share of the variance will be $40,000 ($1 million divided by the total of $10 million = 10% times the $400,000 variance). The pro rata share of the variance assigned to the cost of goods sold will be $360,000 ($9 million divided by $10 million = 90% times the $400,000 variance).",what
Why aren't retained earnings distributed as dividends to the stockholders?,"A corporation's earnings are usually retained instead of being distributed to the stockholders in the form of dividends because the corporation is in need of money to strengthen its financial position, to expand its operations, or to keep up with the inflation in its present size of operations.
The stockholders may prefer to forego dividends in order to see its stock value increase from the corporation's wise use of the retained earnings. This is especially true of  U.S. individuals in high federal and state  income tax brackets. These stockholders might end up paying 40% of the dividend amount in income taxes. They would rather have their stock appreciate in value with no tax payments and later sell their shares of stock at the lower capital gains tax rates.",what
What is the return on stockholders' equity (after tax) ratio?,"The return on stockholders' equity, or return on equity, is a corporation's net income after income taxes divided by average amount of stockholders' equity during the period of the net income.
To illustrate, let’s assume that a corporation's net income after tax was $100,000 for the most recent year. Let’s also assume that it did not have any preferred stock outstanding and that its stockholders’ equity was $950,000 at the beginning of the year and was $1,050,000 at the end of the year. The increase was at a uniform rate throughout the year. The return on stockholders’ equity will be 10% ($100,000 divided by the average stockholders’ equity of $1,000,000).
If a corporation has preferred stock outstanding, the relevant name is return on common equity and will be calculated as follows: net income after tax minus the required dividends on its preferred stock, divided by the average amount of common stockholders' equity during the period of the income.
As with most ratios, you should compare your corporation's return on equity with the ratio for other corporations in your industry.",what
Does the income statement explain the change in the equity section of a balance sheet?,"The income statement could explain the change in the equity section of a balance sheet. However, there are likely to be some other explanations as well.
Here is a list of the items that would cause an increase in the total amount of a corporation's stockholders' equity:

Positive net earnings or net income reported on the corporation's income statement.
Some positive Other Comprehensive Income items occurred but they are not to be reported on the income statement.
Additional shares of stock were issued in exchange for cash or other assets.
Donated capital was received.

Here is a list of items that could cause a decrease in the total amount of a corporation's stockholders' equity:

Negative net earnings or a net loss reported on the corporation's income statement.
Some negative Other Comprehensive Income items occurred but they are not to be reported the income statement.
The corporation declared cash dividends.

To see all of the explanations for the change in the equity section of a balance sheet, you should review the statement of stockholders' equity. This financial statement should be issued along with a corporation's balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows.",what
Do corporations issue both common stock and preferred stock?,"Some corporations issue both common stock and preferred stock. However, most corporations issue only common stock. In other words, it is necessary that a business corporation issue common stock, but it is optional whether the corporation will decide to also issue preferred stock.
Usually the holders or owners of a corporation's common stock elect the corporation's directors, vote on significant matters, and enjoy increases in the value of their shares of common stock when the corporation becomes successful.
On the other hand, the holders of preferred stock usually receive only a fixed dividend, which must be paid before the common stock is paid a dividend. Because of that fixed dividend, the preferred stock will not increase in value as the corporation becomes increasingly successful.",what
Does a dividend reduce profit?,"When a corporation declares and pays a dividend, the dividend does not reduce the current accounting period's profit reported on the income statement. In other words, a dividend is not an expense.
Dividends will reduce the amount of the corporation's retained earnings. Retained earnings are reported in the stockholders' equity section of the balance sheet.
If a corporation has very profitable uses for its cash, its future profits might be less if it pays dividends instead of reinvesting the cash dividend amounts into profitable projects.",what
"What is ""deficit"" appearing in stockholders' equity?",The term deficit is used instead of retained earnings when the retained earnings is a negative amount.,what
What is callable stock?,"Callable stock is an ownership interest (shares) in a corporation that can be ""called in"" by the corporation at a specified price.
For example, a corporation might issue 9% $100 Preferred Stock. The stock agreement (indenture) states that the stock is callable by the corporation after three years at $109 per share plus any accrued interest. If in the fourth year, market rates decline to say 7%, the corporation can call in the preferred stock by paying the call price of $109 plus any accrued interest.
The callable feature allows the corporation to get out of the preferred stock agreement requiring it to pay the $9 per share dividend. In turn, the stockholders will be deprived of receiving the $9 dividend in a 7% market. The call price has the effect of limiting how high the market value of preferred stock will rise.",what
Why is there a large difference between share value and stockholders' equity?,"There can be many reasons why the market value of a corporation's stock is much greater than the amount of stockholders' equity reported on the balance sheet. Let's start by defining stockholders' equity as the difference between the asset amounts reported on the balance sheet minus the liability amounts. Next, the accountant's cost principle requires that only the cost of items purchased can be reported as an asset. This means that valuable trade names that were never purchased (but were developed over time) are not reported on the balance sheet. The same holds for a great management team and an amazing reputation. The cost principle also means that many long-term assets are reported at cost (and not at their current higher market value). Many plant assets are reported at minimal amounts because their costs have been reduced by the cumulative amount of depreciation taken over the years.
Other factors contributing to a high market value might be a corporation's earnings and dividends that are consistently growing and/or a special niche for its products or services that is recognized by the market.
Lastly, a corporation's stockholders' equity may have been reduced from the purchase of treasury stock at a high cost.",what
Where do preferred stocks go on the P&L?,"The amount received from issuing preferred stock is reported on the balance sheet within the stockholders' equity section.
Only the annual preferred dividend is reported on the income statement. The annual preferred dividend requirement is subtracted from a corporation's net income and the remainder is described as the Income Available for Common Stock.",what
What is the definition of capital market?,"Often, capital market refers to the structured market for trading stocks and bonds. Examples are the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, and the New York Bond Exchange.
However, capital market can also include less structured markets such as private placements for stocks, bonds, and other debt.",what
Which financial statement shows a corporation's worth?,"Not one of the financial statements will show a corporation's worth. The balance sheet, income statement, statement of cash flows, and stockholders' equity statement merely provide information to assist financial experts in forming an opinion of a corporation's worth.
In the past, some people mistakenly thought that a corporation's stockholders' equity was the corporation's worth. However, stockholders' equity (or the owner's equity of a proprietorship) is merely the result of subtracting the reported amount of liabilities from the reported amount of assets. Since the reported amounts reflect the cost principle and other accounting principles, the net result cannot be assumed to be the company's worth.",what
What is a dividend and why is it needed?,"A dividend paid by a corporation is a distribution of profits to the owners of the corporation. The owners of a corporation are known as stockholders or shareholders. (In a sole proprietorship, the distribution of profits to the owner is referred to as a draw.)
A corporation's board of directors, which is elected by the stockholders, decides if a cash dividend is needed. The considerations for paying or not paying a dividend include the stockholders' wishes, the stock market's reaction, and the corporation's needs and opportunities for cash in the present and in the future.",what
What is a favorable variance?,"Definition of a Variance
In accounting the term variance usually refers to the difference between an actual amount and a planned or budgeted amount. For example, if a company's budget for supplies expense is $30,000 and the actual amount is $28,000 or $34,000, there will be a variance of $2,000 or $4,000 respectively. Similarly, if a company has budgeted its revenues to be $200,000 and its actual revenues end up being $193,000 or $208,000, there will be a variance of $7,000 or $8,000 respectively.
When is a Variance Favorable
A favorable variance indicates that the variance or difference between the budgeted and actual amounts was good or favorable for the company's profits. In other words, this variance will be one reason why the amount of the company's actual profits will be better than the budgeted profits.
Favorable Expense Variance
For example, if supplies expense was budgeted to be $30,000 but the actual supplies expense ends up being $28,000, the $2,000 variance is favorable because having fewer expenses than were budgeted was good for the company's profits. It is one reason why the company's actual profits will be better than the budgeted profits.
Favorable Revenue Variance
If a company had budgeted its revenues to be $200,000 and the actual revenues end up being $208,000, the company will have a favorable variance of $8,000. The variance is favorable because having the actual revenues being more than the amount budgeted is good for the company's profits. It will also be a factor why the company's actual profits will be better than the budgeted profits.",what
What is Subchapter S?,"Subchapter S refers to a section of Chapter 1 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code.
A subchapter S corporation, which is also referred to as an S corporation, is a corporation that does not pay the income taxes on its income. Rather, the owners of the S corporation are responsible for the income taxes which pertain to their share of the S corporation's income. Hence, the income statement of an S corporation does not report income tax expense, and the balance sheet does not report income taxes payable.
There are certain requirements in order to elect the Subchapter S status. Learn more about Subchapter S corporations at www.IRS.gov or from a tax professional.",what
What is a stock split?,"Definition of Stock Split
A stock split usually refers to a corporation dividing its existing number of shares of common stock into a greater number of shares. For instance, a corporation with 100,000 shares of stock before a 2-for-1 stock split will have 200,000 shares after the split. An investor owning 100 shares before the stock is split 2-for-1 will have 200 shares after the split.
Stock Price After a Stock Split
Since the corporation is not changed (total assets, liabilities, stockholders' equity remain the same) by the stock split, the change in the number of shares will cause a change in the market price of each share. For example, if a share had been trading at $50 before a 2-for-1 stock split, a share should be trading at $25 after the stock split.
If the corporation had 100,000 shares of common stock trading at $50 per share before a 2-for-1 stock split, the total market value of the shares would have been $5 million. After the 2-for-1 stock split, the corporation's market value will also be $5 million (200,000 shares X $25 per share). This is the same for each investor. For example, the 10 shares owned by a small investor had a market value of $500 (10 shares X $50). After the 2-for-1 stock split, the small investor shares will also have a market value of $500 (20 shares X $25).
Why Stock Splits Occur
Stock splits such as 2-for-1, 3-for-2, 4-for-1, etc. (which increase the number of shares) are intended to decrease the market price of each share of a corporation's common stock. Often the purpose is to allow small investors to purchase 100 shares of the corporation's stock at a more reasonable total cost.
Reverse stock splits such as 1-for-10 (which decrease the number of shares) are intended to increase the market price of each share of stock. Usually the purpose is to minimize the number of small investors. To illustrate, assume that a corporation had 800,000 shares of stock that were trading at $2 per share (resulting in a total market value of $1.6 million). After a 1-for-10 reverse stock split, there will be only 80,000 shares trading at $20 per share (which also results in a total market value of $1.6 million). Prior to the reverse stock split, small investors were able to purchase 100 shares for just $200. After the stock split, an investor will need $2,000 (100 shares X $20) to purchase 100 shares.",what
